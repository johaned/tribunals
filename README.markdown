MoJ Tribunals
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/tribunals.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/tribunals)

About
-----
A Ruby on Rails application for giving public access to UK Tribunal decisions.

Live at https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/

Installation
------------

Clone the repo & cd into it. Then

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

If you don't have Qt installed (capybara gem will let you know, as it
will fail building), you'll need to install it. On OS X:

    brew install qt

On **OS X**: install http://postgresapp.com/ After installation, click the
elephant icon in the task bar and select **open psql**.

In the terminal window that opens, type:

    create database tribunals_development;

After a brief pause, it should say **CREATE DATABASE**. Quit **psql**.

Then

    rake db:migrate

Run

    ./bin/passwd db/password.hash

to generate a password for the web admin.

This application requires 'soffice', a binary that comes with Libre
Office. See the **section below** on how to install Libre Office for
the appropriate OS.

Then start the app:

    rails s

Configuration
-------------

In order to upload decisions in the development environment, please
configure the CarrierWave uploaders to use the local file system by
including the line 'storage :file' instead of 'storage :fog' in the
files: app/uploaders/doc_file_uploader.rb and
app/uploaders/pdf_file_uploader.rb.

Installing libreoffice on OSX
-----------------------------

Download and install the standard LibreOffice application. You will
need to add the binaries to your path though. Simply add this line:

    export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS"

to the bottom of your ~/.bash_profile and then re-read your config for
the change to take effect:

    source ~/.bash_profile

Installing libreoffice on CentOS
--------------------------------

Should be as simple as:

    sudo yum install libreoffice
    sudo yum install openoffice.org-headless

Importing from legacy system
----------------------------

In the import rake namespace are the scripts to scrape the exisiting
sites. They will not process the word documents though, and that needs
to be done with `rake import:import_word_docs_from_urls`.

### Importing AAC decisions data

Run the following sequence of rake tasks:

    rake import:aac:decisions
    rake import:aac:decision_categories
    rake import:aac:decision_subcategories
    rake import:aac:judges
    rake import:aac:decisions_judges_mapping

### Importing EAT data export

Run the following task:

    rake import:eat:all

If you need to find out the individual tasks, run the following
command to get the listing:

    rake -T import:eat

Tips
----

* On OS X, having LibreOffice open whilst processing docs will fail the processing
