The claimant was entitled to long- term incapacity benefit. This ceased when she became 60 in January 1997 and became entitled to Category A retirement pension. On 11 September 1997 she claimed income support on the basis that she was entitled to have higher pensioner premium included in her applicable amount. She would not otherwise have been entitled to income support because of the level of her income. The claim was rejected on the ground that the claimant had not been continuously entitled to income support since her entitlement to long-term incapacity benefit ceased on account of payment of retirement pension as required by paragraph 12(1)(c) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and so did not satisfy the conditions for higher pensioner premium prescribed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 2. The claimant requested a review which was refused and her appeal against that decision was dismissed by the tribunal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the effect of section 1 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 was that the claimant did not become entitled to income support until she made her claim on 11 September 1997 and so she was not continuously entitled to income support in the period after her entitlement to long-term incapacity benefit ceased and so was not entitled to higher pensioner premium (para. 7);
2.	(obiter) paragraph 12(1)(c)(i) of  Schedule 2 does not require a claimant to have been entitled to income support immediately before attaining pensionable age to be entitled to higher pensioner premium; the words ""has since remained continuously entitled to income support"" can only be read as referring back to the earlier words ""entitlement to [incapacity] benefit ceased"", CIS/4209/1997 followed (para. 10);
3.	(obiter) a claimant falls within paragraph 12(1)(c)(i) if he ceases to be entitled to long-term incapacity benefit on attaining pensionable age and the words of the provision ""ceased on account of the payment of a retirement pension"" had to be read in that light (paras. 15 to 17);
4.	(obiter) the concluding words of paragraph 12(1)(c) do not require an underlying entitlement to income support independently of higher pensioner premium before attaining pensionable age as a condition of entitlement to higher pensioner premium, CIS/4209/1997 not followed (para. 13).",1,172,,,

The claimants husband was made bankrupt in 1996. In 1994, the husband had purchased an annuity with the proceeds of a personal pension scheme. Under section 306 of the Insolvency Act 1986, his right to that annuity was property which vested in the trustee in bankruptcy on the latters appointment taking effect. However, payments under that annuity were not in fact made direct to the trustee until 1 November 1997. Meanwhile, on 6 October 1997, the claimant made a claim for income support, declaring both her own and her husbands annuities. Benefit was awarded taking account of both annuities as income. On 18 November 1997 the claimant reported that her husband had ceased to receive his annuity and in August 1998 the husband reported that the amount of his annuity had increased. 

The adjudication officer reviewed the operative income support decision, finding that the claimants income, taking into account the husbands annuity, was in excess of her applicable amount, and decided that the claimant was therefore not entitled to income support. The claimant appealed, arguing that the decision was wrong in law in the light of the decision of Ferris J in Re Landau (a bankrupt), Pointer v Landau [1998] Ch 223 and that the payments made to her husbands trustee in bankruptcy could not in law be treated as part of her income. The adjudication officer relied on CIS/212/1989 in which the Commissioner had decided the share of profits from the claimants wife (an undischarged bankrupt who was trading in partnership with her husband in a florists business) should be treated as part of the claimants income. The adjudication officer had further relied on CIS/295/1994 which had followed CIS/212/1989. The appeal tribunal dismissed the claimants appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, maintaining her case that the income from her husbands annuity was not available to the couple to use to live on and that, as a matter of law, it belonged to the trustee in bankruptcy. The Secretary of State opposed the appeal, but drew attention to the decision in CIS/745/1999 (now reported as R(IS) 4/01) in which the Commissioner had held (relying on the Court of Appeal in Leeves v Chief Adjudication Officer now reported as R(IS) 5/99) that an amount deducted from the claimants occupational pension at source to meet an attachment of earnings order did not form part of the claimants income. The Secretary of State further recognised that the effect of CIS/212/1989 had been questioned in other decisions. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. in the present case the claimants husbands right to payment of the annuity had vested in the trustee in bankruptcy under section 306 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and the payments of the annuity were not part of his and the claimants actual income for income support purposes (paragraph 22);
2. as to the meaning of the term income, the general approach was set out by the Court of Appeal in Leeves v Chief Adjudication Officer [R(IS) 5/99] and applied by the Commissioner in CIS/5479/1997, that is that, as there is no general definition of income in the Income Support Regulations or the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the term should be given its ordinary and natural meaning (paragraph 18);
3. taking that approach, the Court of Appeal in Leeves had found that it was income which was received which counted in the Income Support Regulations, and, in CIS/5479/1997, the Commissioner had found that that approach confirmed his view of the general context of the Regulations which was that income to be taken into account was income which was actually paid to a claimant (referring to paragraph 9 of CIS/5479/1997) (paragraph 18);
4. that general approach was inconsistent with paragraph 9 of CIS/212/1989 and with the result reached in CIS/295/1994, and, since the approach rested in part on the authority of the Court of Appeal in Leeves, the Commissioner would apply it unless there were something to make the circumstances of bankruptcy a special case (paragraph 19);
5.  the Commissioner concluded that bankruptcy was not a special case, and, accordingly, he declined to follow paragraph 9 of CIS/212/1989 and CIS/295/1994 being satisfied that they were wrong (paragraphs 20 and 22);
6. as at 4 September 1998 (the date beyond which any change of circumstances could not be taken in account) regulation 42(4) (as it stood before 9 November 1999) of the Income Support Regulations did not apply, nor did any other part of regulation 42 on notional income and, furthermore, there was no question of any intentional deprivation of income (paragraph 23);
7. any consideration of the amendment to regulation 42(4) as from 9 November 1999 was a matter for the Secretary of State.

The Commissioner found that the tribunals decision was erroneous in point of law, set it aside and substituted his own decision. 

[Note: In relation to bankruptcy orders made on or after 29 May 2000, section 11 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 provides that any rights of a bankrupt under approved pension arrangements are excluded from the bankrupts estate (see section 12 for unapproved arrangements).]",1,111,,,

The claimant and her son bought her home (which in 1993 was worth £27,000) from the local authority, contributing one sixth and five sixths respectively to the total purchase price. In March 1993 the claimant moved to a residential home, and in June 1993 her income support was terminated on the grounds that she possessed capital in excess of £8000, as a result of her being deemed under regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1997 to be the beneficial owner of half of the house. That decision was appealed against. In August 1997 the claimant died, and her son, who at all material times was her appointee, continued the appeal. In June 1998 the social security appeal tribunal held that the deceased claimant had an equal half-share in the value of the house and therefore did not qualify for income support. In October 2001 the Commissioner allowed an appeal from that decision, substituting a determination that at all material times the value of her capital was less than £8000. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	(per Brooke LJ) the critical words in regulation 52 for interpretation on the appeal are 
"" ... where a claimant and one or more persons are beneficially entitled in possession to any capital asset ... ""; the language of regulation 52 lends itself naturally to a situation in which two or more people are jointly entitled to the equitable interest in the same capital asset, in which case they do not each possess a separate share in the equitable interest, but are jointly vested with the whole of that interest; in that case, the natural reading of regulation 52 is therefore to treat that unity as severed and to treat the claimant as if he/she was entitled to an equal share (with the others) of the whole beneficial interest; the claimant is then treated as possessing capital which he or she does not in fact possess (such result being permitted by section 136(5)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992) (paragraph 16);
2.	however, with tenancies in common, there is no need to treat a claimant's unity of interest as if it had been severed for the purpose of computing fairly the capital he/she owns for the purposes of Part VII of the 1992 Act; a beneficial interest which a claimant owns as a tenant in common is an asset separately disposable by him or her in both English and Scots law (paragraph 17);
3.	on the facts of the present case, the son's five sixths beneficial interest in his mother's house and his mother's one sixth interest represented separate capital assets of which each was free to dispose; it would therefore be misuse of language to say that the two of them were beneficially entitled to the house within the meaning of regulation 52: they were not (paragraph 18);
4.	the interpretation of regulation 52 in CIS/3283/1997 where it was stated that the application of the regulation may inescapably result in a claimant being regarded as possessing a greater share than in fact he did, was not inevitable (paragraphs 22 and 23);

5.	(per Sedley LJ) the current form of regulation 52 does not even meet the purpose of administrative convenience argued for by the Secretary of State (paragraph 27);

6.	the Secretary of State's suggested construction of the regulation does, however, replace the true share with a crude calculation which can be both a source of real unfairness and an incentive to create multiple shares, perhaps spuriously, in order to drive up the divisor and so drive down the imputed value of the claimant's interest (paragraph 28);

7.	in view of these considerations, the Secretary of State did not make out the breadth of meaning contended for and, the Court being left with the power granted by Parliament, that power would be read down (as the Commissioner had done) so as to protect the deceased claimant (paragraph 30);

The claimant suffered an accident on 13 September 1991. In April 1996 his claim for compensation was settled at £50,000. In the meantime the Secretary of State had issued, under Part IV of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, a certificate of total benefit in the sum of £30,926.10, which was subsequently revised on review to the sum of £26,968.32 on the basis that benefit paid after 12 October 1995 was not attributable to the relevant accident. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal and, because the claimant blamed his disablement on pre-existing psoriatic spondylosis, the tribunal referred that question to a medical appeal tribunal. The medical appeal tribunal decided that the claimant had been suffering from an injury to his neck until ""13 weeks from 8 January 1996"" (a decision formulated on the basis of a Med 3 which advised the claimant not to work during that period due to ""neck injury"") but made no finding that the relevant injury was the cause of the neck injury throughout that period or at all. The reconvened social security appeal tribunal held on 7 December 1998 had before it a letter from the Benefits Agency dated 13 November 1998 informing the claimant that an adjudicating medical authority had decided that the relevant accident had caused a loss of faculty from 27 December 1991 to 26 December 1992 and there was evidence before the tribunal that the adjudicating medical authority had considered that symptoms after 26 December 1992 were due to pre-existing conditions. The social security appeal tribunal disallowed the claimant's appeal on the basis that the claimant was suffering from the effects of the injury until the date his claim was settled. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	if benefit was to be recovered from a compensation payment made in respect of a relevant accident the relevant accident must have been an effective cause of the injury giving rise to the payment of benefit throughout the period in which recovery was sought, because otherwise it could not be said that the benefit was paid ""in respect of"" the accident throughout the period;
2.	whilst it was not in dispute that the relevant accident caused or contributed to a neck injury, there was a question whether it caused the neck injury that was still subsisting in early 1996 or whether it was still contributing to that injury;
3.	the tribunal had erred because that question had not been determined by either the medical appeal tribunal or the social security appeal tribunal or alternatively no reasons had been given for the determination.

A tribunal allowed the parent with care's appeal on the basis that the court order dealt with school fees only and was therefore not a ""maintenance order"". The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner, who decided that the court order required the making of periodical payments to or for the benefit of the children, and the fact that the order referred only to school fees did not cause the order to fall outside the definition of ""maintenance order"" in section 8(11) of the Child Support Act 1991.

On 15 January 1997 the person with care of two qualifying children applied for a departure direction in respect of a maintenance assessment relying on regulations 24 (diversion of income) and 25 (inconsistent life-style) of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendment Regulations 1996. She alleged that the absent parent had been a partner in and then sole proprietor of a firm DG, which had been acquired by a different firm DG Limited, in which the absent parent was an employee, for less than its value. She further alleged the absent parent was living with a woman who was the company secretary of DG Limited, and his father was a director, and substantial assets were under the control of or available to the absent parent, although through a variety of methods he had disguised this. The Secretary of State referred the application to a child support appeal tribunal for determination. Meanwhile, on 22 July 1997 a consent order was made by a District Judge in the county court in relation to financial matters ancillary to the divorce between the parties. On 25 November 1997 the chairman of the tribunal issued directions requiring documentary and other evidence in relation to DG and directing both parties to attend the tribunal hearing, warning that if the directions were not followed the tribunal may draw adverse inferences. On 25 March 1998 all parties attended a tribunal but certain papers were submitted at the hearing and the tribunal decided to adjourn so that it and the parties could consider them and to arrange for a witness summons to be served on the Company Secretary requiring her to attend and produce the company accounts and documentary evidence of her own income.

On 13 May 1998 the chairman refused to set it aside and on 26 May 1998 she sought leave to appeal to the Commissioner against that decision, which was refused by the chairman on 11 June 1998 on the ground that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain it.

The clerk made a note of the call and referred it to the chairman who refused to postpone the hearing. The parent with care attended but the absent parent and the Company Secretary did not. The parent with care stated that she had seen the absent parent the previous day, he had seemed well, he had no history of migraine attacks, she regarded his absence as intentional and a friend of his had done a similar thing in the context of a court appearance. She pointed out that he had failed to comply with the chairman's directions and that the Company Secretary had ignored the witness summons.  The Secretary of State's representative was content to proceed and the tribunal decided to proceed, noting the history of delay and evasion and the failure of the Company Secretary to attend or to send in the papers she was required to produced.

She alleged that the absent parent had been a partner in and then sole proprietor of a firm DG, which had been acquired by a different firm DG Limited, in which the absent parent was an employee, for less than its value. She further alleged the absent parent was living with a woman who was the company secretary of DG Limited, and his father was a director, and substantial assets were under the control of or available to the absent parent, although through a variety of methods he had disguised this. The Secretary of State referred the application to a child support appeal tribunal for determination. Meanwhile, on 22 July 1997 a consent order was made by a District Judge in the county court in relation to financial matters ancillary to the divorce between the parties. On 25 November 1997 the chairman of the tribunal issued directions requiring documentary and other evidence in relation to DG and directing both parties to attend the tribunal hearing, warning that if the directions were not followed the tribunal may draw adverse inferences.

The tribunal gave a departure direction in respect of lifestyle inconsistent because it could not accept that he would now be living on so low an income as he had declared; and in respect of partner's contribution to housing costs that 50% be attributable to each party because they were both working, had no dependants, and therefore contributed equally.

In March 1992, the claimant was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom for six months as a visitor subject to a condition prohibiting employment. She was later granted leave to remain exceptionally outside the immigration rules in order to care for her son, a British citizen settled in the United Kingdom, subject again to a prohibition on employment. In March 1993, the Secretary of State granted the claimant exceptional leave to remain until 25 August 1994. The claimant's solicitors applied to the Secretary of State for another extension before her leave expired. No decision had been made by 21 April 1996, the date the disability appeal tribunal was due to hear the claimant's appeal against the refusal of her claim for disability living allowance. The tribunal decided that she satisfied the medical conditions for entitlement to the mobility and care components from 19 January 1993 but awarded entitlement to 4 February 1996 only. It accepted the adjudication officer's submission that any entitlement would be excluded from 5 February 1996 by the amendments to regulation 2 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 (the DLA Regulations). Regulation 4 of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations 1996 (the Amendment Regulations) amended regulation 2 so that it became a condition of entitlement to disability living allowance that the claimant's right to reside or remain in Great Britain was not subject to any condition or limitation. However, under regulation 2(1A)(b) a person who had been granted exceptional leave to remain was to be treated as satisfying that condition. The chairman granted leave to appeal to the Commissioner. The adjudication officer submitted that the claimant came within regulation 2(1A)(b) of the DLA Regulations by virtue of the Immigration (Variation of Leave) Order 1976. Article 3(1) of the Order extended leave until 28 days after the decision on the application for variation of leave or its withdrawal, provided the application was made before the expiry of the current leave.

Held, allowing the appeal that:
1.	the Immigration (Variation of Leave) Order 1976 applied only to cases where limited leave was granted in accordance with the immigration rules under the Immigration Act 1971. However, a similar rule to the Order must apply in cases which were outside the immigration rules as the system for granting leave exceptionally appeared to be ""an essential adjunct to the rules themselves and to underpin their operation"". Therefore, a person who had been granted exceptional leave to remain and had applied for a variation of the leave before it expired, must be treated as still having that limited leave, subject to whatever conditions applied, until 28 days after the application was decided or withdrawn (para. 8);
2.	on the evidence before the tribunal, whether or not the Order applied to the claimant, she was a person who fell within regulation 2(1A)(b) of the DLA Regulations. Therefore her entitlement to disability living allowance could not be excluded by regulation 2(1)(a)(ia) on the ground that her right to remain in Great Britain was subject to a limitation or a condition (para. 9).
The Commissioner set aside the decision and remitted the appeal to a new tribunal with directions to hear all the matters afresh and to apply the legal approach set out in the decision to the application of regulation 2 of the DLA Regulations.

In early October 1998 the claimant appealed to a disability appeal tribunal. He also submitted further evidence in support of his claim consisting of a letter from his GP dated 3 November 1998.

The claimant was in receipt of an award of disability living allowance limited to 11 February 1998. She made a renewal claim on 6 November 1997 which was refused. She applied for a review under section 30(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, submitting that her situation had not altered and that she was also due to go into hospital for a hip replacement operation on 7 March 1998 which she expected would increase her needs. She submitted a report from her GP dated 29 April 1998 which indicated that her mobility would be restricted for six months. On 1 July 1998 a Senior Registrar at the hospital wrote a report which indicated that the claimant had begun mobilisation two days after the operation and was now fully weight bearing. On review, the adjudication officer confirmed the refusal of the claim. The claimant appealed to a disability appeal tribunal who found she had continuing problems after 11 February 1998 but that she had improved sufficiently by the beginning of July to take her outside the conditions of entitlement and so she did not satisfy the six month prospective qualifying period for an award of disability living allowance. They relied on the hospital report of 1 July 1998. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal erred in law by relying on the hospital report as it did not deal with the issue of whether the claimant was in severe discomfort when walking (para. 13);
2.	in view of the evidence and the tribunal's findings of fact, the tribunal erred in law by failing to consider whether the adjudication officer conducting the review ought to have treated the renewal claim as an application for review to extend the period of the claimant's first award to cover the claimant's post operative recovery (paras. 15 to 18);
3.	by virtue of section 33(7) Social Security Administration Act 1992 and section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998;

(ii)	in the case of disability living allowance the tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to the inclusive period from the date of the claim to the date of the decision under appeal (para. 58);
(iii)	the tribunal was not able to take into account a fresh circumstance arising after the date of the decision under appeal (para. 55);
(iv)	evidence was not admissible if it related to a period later in time than the period within the tribunal's jurisdiction but the tribunal was not limited to evidence that was before the officer who made the decision under appeal or that was in existence at the date of that decision provided the evidence related to the period within the tribunal's jurisdiction (para. 58);
(v)	when considering the prospective six months qualifying period and the period of an award the tribunal was required to take into account any evidence about the claimant's likely disablement beyond the date of the decision that could be related to the circumstances obtaining at that date, including evidence as to what actually occurred after that date unless that amounted to a fresh circumstance, and was required to make relevant findings of fact on probability based on their assessment of admissible evidence (paras. 59 to 68);

Mobility component - pre-lingually deaf - whether guidance or supervision arising from fear and anxiety may be considered

In each of these four cases it was accepted that the claimant was, by any criteria, severely disabled, one of the claimants suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, one suffering from epilepsy, and the other two having been profoundly deaf since birth. The question of whether severity of disablement is to be treated as a separate and additional test of entitlement or is to be judged by reference to the statutory criteria relating to care or mobility needs and as part of those criteria was therefore not in issue. In each case the claimant had been awarded some rate of the care component of disability living allowance. The main issue in these appeals, and one which had caused a divergence of views amongst Commissioners, was whether supervision or attention requirements which qualify or which might go towards qualifying a claimant for an award of the care component under section 72 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 should or should not be taken into account when assessing the need for supervision or guidance under section 73(1)(d) of that Act. The other issues were whether the words ""cannot take advantage of"" should be subject to some implied qualification and, in the cases involving the pre-lingually deaf claimants: (i) whether any attention with the bodily function of hearing which counted towards potential entitlement to the care component should be disregarded; (ii) whether a pre-lingually deaf person with consequent severely impaired comprehension of English, who was too frightened or nervous to walk on unfamiliar routes and never did so unaccompanied, could ever be entitled to the lower rate of mobility component; and (iii) whether ""guidance"" included assistance with communication in order to ask for directions.

Held, in each case allowing the appeal, that:
1. in determining whether a claimant cannot take advantage of the faculty of walking out of doors without guidance or supervision for most of the time, the fact that the guidance or supervision necessary, or elements of that guidance or supervision, may also constitute attention or supervision which qualifies, or could go towards qualifying, the claimant to entitlement to the care component is to be ignored (paragraph 14, and paragraphs 11 and 13 for the reasons for rejecting the submissions to the contrary on behalf of the Secretary of State) and Commissioners' decisions to the contrary, including CDLA/757/1994, are not to be followed;
2. the application of the words ""cannot take advantage of"" in particular cases is left to the good sense of  decision-makers and tribunals (para. 15);
3. in relation to deaf claimants, and in particular the pre-lingually deaf: (i) attention with the bodily function of hearing is not to be disregarded (para. 17); (ii) fear or anxiety (not in itself amounting to a physical or mental disability) which results from the disablement may be taken into account (para. 18); and (iii) in some cases of a limited ability to communicate and to receive information, a need for guidance from another person most of the time may be made out (para. 19).

The claimant, who is registered blind, was in receipt of the lower rate of the mobility component and the lowest rate of the care component of disability living allowance from 29 June 1992. On 24 May 1994  he requested a review of his entitlement, claiming an increased need for help to get about when out of doors or shopping, and assistance to have letters read to and written for him. On  18 July 1994 an adjudication officer considered that the decision of the House of Lords in Mallinson v. Secretary of State for Social Security (R(A) 3/94) issued on 21 April 1994 constituted a relevant change of circumstances but refused to revise the award. Following an application to review that decision under section 30(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 a further adjudication officer reached the same conclusion. The claimant appealed against that decision and whilst protracted appeal procedures were taking place in his case the House of Lords in Secretary of State for Social Security v. Fairey (R(A) 2/98) upheld the decision of a Commissioner dated 14 October 1994 on the relevance of care needs in a social context. Thereafter a second disability appeal tribunal heard but disallowed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner with particular reference to his care needs.
 
Held, allowing the appeal and remitting the case for rehearing by a different tribunal, that:
1.	the tribunal's findings and reasons were inadequate to explain and justify their conclusion on the aspects and level of the claimant's requirements for attention by day in connection with the bodily function of sight (para. 6);
2.	the decision under appeal to the tribunal was the adjudication officer's decision of 
25 August 1994. The tribunal failed to note that the correct ground of review consequent upon Mallinson was error of law and not relevant change of circumstances, and failed adequately to explain their assessment of the claimant's relevant care needs (para. 7 and 8);
3.	in the event of the new tribunal being satisfied that the claimant's needs were decisive in establishing entitlement to the middle rate of the care component, the statutory limitation on payment on a review following an erroneous decision must be considered. Because of the relevant dates, section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (now superseded by section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998) would remain applicable. The extent of that application would depend upon the tribunal's assessment of the impact attributable to Mallinson and Fairey respectively (para. 10); 
4.	if the award fell to be revised on review for error of law because of Mallinson, arrears would be payable from 21 April 1994, the date of the relevant determination, whereas if it fell to be revised because of Fairey, arrears would be payable from 29 June 1992, the date of the awarding decision (para. 10).",1,253,,"Reviews, revisions and supersessions: reviews under the 1992 Act",

The claimant had been awarded the higher rates of the care and mobility components of disability living allowance for life. It came to light that the claimant might not have been so severely disabled as she had claimed and she was asked to complete a further claim form and to submit to an examination by a Benefits Agency Medical Service doctor, following which a review was conducted resulting in an award of the lower rate care component only. The claimant appealed to a disability appeal tribunal, who refused the appeal, deciding there had been a change of circumstances in that the Benefits Agency Medical Service doctor's report indicated that the criteria for an award of the higher rates of mobility and care components were not satisfied. They gave reasons for preferring the evidence of the Benefits Agency Medical Services doctor to that of the claimant's consultant. The claimant appealed, contending that the tribunal had erred in law by preferring the evidence of the Benefits Agency Medical Service doctor to that of her consultant who was a specialist in the field and that the new medical report was not in itself a change in circumstances. The Deputy Commissioner refused the appeal holding that the tribunal were entitled to prefer the evidence of either doctor provided they gave good reasons for their choice, which they had done, and that where a new medical report provided evidence that circumstances were not as they had previously been accepted to be, either circumstances must have changed or the previous assumptions must have been incorrect, and in this case to assume that there had been an improvement in the claimant's condition operated in her favour. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, relying on Regina v. Social Security Commissioner, ex parte Chamberlain (Lightman J, 7 July 2000).

The claimant who was a severely disabled child, born in Pakistan and brought to the United Kingdom by her parents, had been awarded disability living allowance from 27 September 1993 to 26 September 1996. Her claim for the benefit to be renewed from 27 September 1996 was refused because she did not satisfy regulation 4 of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 (""the 1996 regulations""). Regulation 4 which came into effect on 5 February 1996 created a new requirement for entitlement: that a claimant's right to reside or remain in Great Britain was not subject to any limitation or condition. The claimant did not satisfy this requirement because she had remained beyond the period of her leave to enter the United Kingdom. A tribunal allowed the claimant's appeal on the grounds that regulation 12(3) applied to her claim. Regulation 12(3) provided that ""Where, before the coming into force of these Regulations, a person is receiving ...  disability living allowance ...  under the ...  Disability Living Allowance Regulations ...  those Regulations shall, until such time as his entitlement to that benefit is reviewed under section ...   30 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, have effect as if regulation  ...   4  ...  of these Regulations had not been made."" The Commissioner allowed the adjudication officer's appeal following R. v. Chief Adjudication Officer ex parte B [1999] 1 WLR 1695 and the Court of Appeal subsequently dismissed the claimant's appeal. It was argued before the House of Lords, that the effect of the natural and ordinary meaning of regulation 12(3) was to enable not only an award of benefit made before 5 February 1996 to be transitionally protected but to enable an award on a further claim after that date to be made as there had been no review of her entitlement to benefit under section 30 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. 

Held, by the House of Lords, dismissing the claimant's appeal, that:  
1.	the evident purpose of regulation 12 was to save or preserve accrued rights to benefit to which the claimant was entitled to immediately before the amending regulations came into force. The fact that regulation 12 could not be read literally in this respect did not mean that the Court could depart from the ordinary meaning of the words of the regulation in other respects (see Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v. Ali [2001] 2 WLR 735, 757 paragraphs 63-65 per Lord Hoffmann). The general words of an elliptically drafted statute were not necessarily to be interpreted literally regardless of the context and the object of the regulation (see In re International Tin Council [1989] CH 309, 329-330);
2.	the extent to which regulation 4 was to be disapplied derived from the terms of the precondition and the evident purpose of the regulation. The disapplication was limited to the claimant's accrued right to the particular benefit which she was receiving immediately before the amending regulations came into force which, in the claimant's case, was the right to receive disability living allowance of a stated amount for a period of three years. Regulation 4 was only disapplied as regards that entitlement;
3.	regulation 12(3) did not have the effect of extending the amount or duration of the claimant's award beyond the term for which it was awarded even without the words ""...  until such time as his entitlement to that benefit is reviewed under section ...  30 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992"". There was no anomaly in a situation where the protection of regulation 12(3) ceased on expiry of a fixed term award but continued indefinitely in the case of a life award because in both cases, the protection continued as long as it was needed to preserve an accrued entitlement but no longer. (Gibson LJ's remarks in ex parte B at page 1706 confirmed);
4.	the words ""entitlement to benefit""  in ""shall continue until  ...  his entitlement to benefit is reviewed"" referred to that benefit which the claimant was receiving immediately before the amending 
regulation came into force. This was another example of elliptical drafting, which must be understood as a reference to the decision under which the claimant's entitlement to the benefit arose. The cessation provision was thus brought into line with the precondition; since both were concerned with the preservation of accrued rights under an existing award which predated the coming into force of the amending regulations but which is subject to review;
5.	the preservation of accrued rights did not justify their enlargement by disapplying regulation 4 to new and repeat claims and a decision on a review could properly be equated with a decision on a repeat claim.",1,243,,Residence and presence conditions: persons subject to immigration control,

The claimant and her husband were Turkish nationals and, at all material times, were seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.  An adjudication officer refused her claim for family credit on the ground that, by virtue of regulation 3(1)(aa) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987, she was not to be treated as being in Great Britain because her right to reside or remain in Great Britain was subject to a limitation or condition.  The claimant's appeal was dismissed by a tribunal and she appealed to the Commissioner.  The Board of Inland Revenue, as successor to the adjudication officer, conceded that an association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey had been concluded and that the Association Council established under the Agreement had adopted Decision No. 3/80 on the application of the social security schemes of Member States to Turkish workers and their families, which provided for equal treatment.  The Board also conceded that the claimant's right to reside or remain in Great Britain was therefore not to be treated as subject to a limitation or condition because she fell within regulation 3(1A)(d), as ""a national of a State with which the Community has established an Agreement under article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community providing, in the field of social security, for the equal treatment of workers who are nationals of the signatory State and their families"".  The Board further conceded that the claimant could, in any event, have relied on the direct effect of Decision 3/80.

Held, accepting the concessions and allowing the appeal, that:
1.	an association Agreement was to be treated, for the purposes of regulation 3(1A)(d), as providing for equal treatment in the social security field, where such provision was made by a Decision of an Association Council that was constituted under the Agreement and required by the Agreement to adopt social security measures;
2.	Decision 3/80 of the Association Council had direct effect in respect of claimants and benefits within its scope.

The claimant was required to use a heavy industrial sewing machine, which vibrated. She was also required to use industrial wire cutters and scissors, which were hand-held but so heavy that they had to rest on the sewing machine. Neither the wire cutters nor the scissors contained their own source of vibration but they transmitted vibration from the sewing machine to the claimant.  An adjudication officer refused her claim for disablement benefit on the basis that she had not worked in employed earner's employment involving the use of hand-held vibrating tools. There was no contention that the sewing machine was itself a hand-held vibrating tool. The tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal. The Commissioner, following CI/156/1994 in preference to CI/136/1995, decided that the tool, when in use, must of itself and independently of any external agency, vibrate and in addition be hand-held. He dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. it was an occupation that was prescribed and what the individual was doing needed to be looked at;
2. if  he or she used a tool which was hand-held and vibrated then it was a hand-held vibrating tool within paragraph A12 of Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985;
3. this construction  was confirmed by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council's Report for Work Related Upper Limb Disorders published  in 1992 (Cmnd. 1936 - May 1992), which had led to the prescription of the disease. The report was based on studies which had shown that carpal tunnel syndrome appeared if there was a combination of gripping and vibration and it did not indicate any interest in the source of vibration.
The Court remitted the case to a differently constituted appeal tribunal on the medical issues.

The claimant was employed by Liverpool City Council from 1969 to 1996. He  had been employed as a forestry worker carrying out tree maintenance across the City. He used chain saws on a daily basis until 1980 when he became a supervisor and used them less often. In 1990 he became a manager and no longer used chain saws. In 1997 he claimed disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease A11, vibration white finger. The issue was whether the disease was prescribed in relation to the claimant. This turned on whether he had been engaged in any occupation involving the use of hand-held chain saws in forestry. 
A tribunal accepted that the claimant worked in forestry. He had been employed for many years working in large wooded areas and public parks, not only managing trees but also planting them. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who dismissed the appeal. The Commissioner, applying Brutus v. Cozens [1973] AC 854 HL, held that the word ""forestry"" was not used in an unusual or technical sense. It was intended to have its ordinary meaning as a way of excluding from the prescribed diseases scheme occupations which had nothing to do with forestry, but including those workers most at risk from the use of chain saws. Whether the claimant was engaged in forestry was a question of fact for the tribunal and the tribunal had acted reasonably and correctly in coming to the conclusion they did. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the words ""in forestry"" in the statutory phrase should not be given too narrow a meaning as the purpose of the statute is to provide compensation for those who suffered the prescribed disease as a result of their occupation;
2..	""in forestry"" is adequately defined by the expression ""the management of growing timber"", and the words should not be cut down further by requiring that growing timber should be in a particular area or should be grown for a particular purpose;
3.	the tribunal did not err in law in deciding on the facts that the claimant came within an occupation involving the use of chain saws in forestry.

The claimant had received disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease D12 for some years before his death on 12 June 1997. On a post-mortem he was discovered to also have prescribed disease D1: pneumoconiosis. A claim in respect of D1 was treated as made on the date of his death, and an adjudicating medical authority decided he had suffered from D1 since 1 January 1995. An assessment of 10% disablement was made from 16 April 1995 to 12 June 1997.  An adjudication officer decided that there was no entitlement for benefit to be backdated beyond 3 months before the date of claim, applying regulation 19 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 as amended from 7 April 1997, and made an award from 12 March 1997 to 12 June 1997.  The claimant's widow (and appointee) appealed. A tribunal dismissed the appeal, and she appealed further to the Commissioner. It was argued for the claimant that he had an accrued right to have the claim for backdating before 12 March 1997 considered under the unamended regulation 19 (in force throughout the period at issue), whereby indefinite backdating could be awarded if good cause for claiming late could be shown.  The Commissioner drew attention to the existing award of disablement benefit, and raised the question of whether the ""claim"" for D1 should have been treated as an application for a review: in which case, backdating would be considered under regulation 60 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995, also amended from 7 April 1997 to restrict backdating on review to one month.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	on the facts of this case, the claimant did not have an accrued right immediately before the amendments came into force to have his claim for backdating determined under the unamended regulation 19, or his application for a review determined under the unamended regulation 60, because the unamended legislation required there to be a judgment about circumstances arising after the date of the amendment; R(F) 1/92 not followed (paras. 8 to 11);
2.	the ""claim"" should have been treated as an application for review, and only one month's arrears paid.

The claimant was called for examination on 18 February 1997. This was the sixth examination arranged for him.

The adjudication officer then decided that he had failed to attend for examination without good cause and was to be treated as capable of work under regulation 8(2) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work)(General) Regulations 1995. The tribunal decided good cause had not been shown and dismissed the appeal.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, contending he could not fail to attend a cancelled examination and complaining that he had been refused benefit on subsequent claims.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	once the medical examination had been cancelled, it was impossible for the claimant to fail to attend it;
2.	a decision under regulation 8(2) terminated the existing period of incapacity for work and had effect until the effective date of a new claim.

The adjudication officer made a decision that she be treated as capable of work from and including 29 November because she had failed without good cause to attend or submit to medical examination on 28 November.  The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, stating that she had not received the notification of either of the appointments and suggesting that they might have been sent to her old address, which she had left in February 1996.  The adjudication officer made a submission to the tribunal asserting that notice of the second appointment had been sent to the claimant at least seven days before 28 November, but did not provide any evidence of this.  The tribunal rejected the appeal and the claimant appealed to a Commissioner.  As at the date of the adjudication officer's submission to the Commissioner, no new decision had been made as to the claimant's capacity for work and so she continued to be treated as capable.

1.	the burden of proving good cause, under regulation 8(2) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995, for failure to attend a medical examination lay on a claimant;
 2.	it was therefore for a claimant to prove non-receipt of an appointment notice that had actually been sent but the burden of proving that the notice had actually been sent lay on the adjudication officer;
3.	a notice was not sent to a person if it was sent to the wrong address and, in any case where the claimant raised a question whether a notice had been sent, which included most cases where it was asserted that a notice had not been received, the adjudication officer was obliged to present evidence to the tribunal that it had been sent to the correct address;

The claimant, a local authority councillor, was paid by his council both a basic and a responsibility allowance. The allowances were paid net of income tax and national insurance contributions. The tribunal accepted the claimant's arguments that in calculating the net amount of the allowance for the purpose of the reduction in benefit provided for by section 30E of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the claimant was entitled to deduct the income tax and national insurance contributions paid by him as an expense and to average heating and lighting costs. The Secretary of State appealed on the ground that the liability to pay income tax and national insurance contributions was not an expense within the meaning of section 30E(3). The averaging of heating and lighting expenses was not disputed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	neither income tax nor national insurance contributions were expenses in connection with the claimant's membership of the council and so could not be deducted in calculating the net amount of the allowances. Liability to income tax depended on an individual's overall income from all sources and did not arise only because the individual claimed incapacity benefit. Whether or not there was any unfairness in the claimant having to pay contributions at the same time as receiving a contributory benefit, rather than receiving credits, was a matter for Parliament rather than a matter that arose in applying section 30E (paras. 9 to 19);
2.	section 30E(3) did not require that expenses be defrayed before they were allowed nor that the amount to be defrayed be identified. Consequently the allowance of expenses based on agreed averages and estimates was not wrong in law. CS/7934/1995 was not followed (paras. 20 to 25).

In August 1995, while the appellant was in receipt of income support, her mother died. By her will, the mother left her house to her children (the appellant and her brother) jointly. The house was not sold and remained empty until January 1997 when the brother moved into the property (with the consent of the appellant). The appellant's interest in the house was not disclosed to the Department of Social Security until April 1997. In May 1997 the adjudication officer valued the appellant's share of the house as being worth at least £8,000. Her benefit entitlement was therefore reviewed, and withdrawn on the basis that her capital exceeded the limit prescribed in regulation 45 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. This had been so since the date on which the mother's will had been admitted into probate (20 September 1995) and it had become possible for her interest in the property to be realised. Before the tribunal, the appellant argued inter alia that her mother's wish had been that the house be used as a home for the brother and that this wish overrode the terms of the will. 
The tribunal upheld the adjudication officer's decision. The appellant appealed to the Commissioner who dismissed her appeal. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that given the occupation of her brother, her share of the house was worthless throughout the relevant period for which she had received income support. Further, she was not entitled to insist on a sale of the house with vacant possession.

Held, dismissing the appeal (Evans LJ dissenting), that:
1.	 (per Mummery and Potter LJJ) under the will the appellant had inherited a half share in the house and as a beneficiary she was entitled to have the assets of the estate administered in accordance with the law and the terms of the will;
2.	(per Mummery and Potter LJJ) the appellant could have obtained an order for the sale of the house with vacant possession if her brother was unwilling to buy her share or refused to agree to a sale. It was not a case like CAO v. Palfrey (R(IS) 26/95) where a property was acquired by joint owners for a collateral purpose which would be defeated if one of those acquiring the property were to insist on a sale while that purpose was still subsisting. In this case, an order for sale would give effect to the testamentary purpose of the testatrix. Neither the brother's share in the house, nor his rights in it, were any greater than those of the appellant either before or after he went into occupation;
3.	 (per Potter LJ) where a claimant is entitled to a half share in a dwelling house, the proper starting point for the valuation of that share is half the market value of the house with vacant possession; the value of the half-interest being discounted in respect of any factors materially affecting the ability of the claimant to market the dwelling house offering vacant possession at completion.  In this case there was no evidence that the brother would have taken active steps, either before or after he went into possession, to resist a sale with vacant possession. Even if, after he had gone into possession, he had taken such steps, there were no good grounds on which he could resist the sale.  That being so, while any valuation of the appellant's half share might in principle have required some discount on the basis that proceedings under section 30 of the Law of Property Act 1925 might have been necessary before the interest could be realised, such discount would be of an insubstantial nature.",1,24,,Capital: joint holdings,

The claimant and her husband lived in the matrimonial home, which was purchased with a joint mortgage.  As a result of the husband's violent behaviour the claimant and her daughter left the matrimonial home. Her husband remained until he moved out on the 27 February 1997. Thereafter the claimant and her daughter returned to the matrimonial home and her husband continued to pay the mortgage until May 1997 when he indicated no further payments would be made. The claimant successfully applied for income support and sought housing costs.  Applying the 39 week waiting period applicable to ""new housing costs"", the adjudication officer determined that the claimant was not entitled to housing costs until 21 November 1997.  The claimant appealed contending that she had been abandoned and sought to qualify for earlier payment under the special exception prescribed in paragraph 8(3)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. Allowing the appeal, the tribunal found that the claimant had been abandoned as her husband's behaviour amounted to constructive desertion.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

The claimant was in receipt of income support and incapacity benefit at the short-term lower rate.  In the summer of 1996, he became entitled to incapacity benefit at the short-term higher rate.  This exceeded his applicable amount and income support came to an end.  A letter would have been sent to the claimant, telling him that his claim had ceased and explaining why.  In January 1997, the claimant began to receive the long-term rate of incapacity benefit (£61.15).   As he met the conditions for entitlement to a disability premium at that date, his income support applicable amount increased to £68.30, and he would therefore have been awarded income support had he re-claimed.  
According to the claimant, he telephoned the Department of Social Security to enquire as to why he was not receiving this higher amount of benefit and was advised that he was receiving his maximum entitlement.  He did not claim income support until June 1998, when he sought to have benefit backdated to January 1997.   He argued that what was said to him by the officer of the Department of Social Security in January 1997 was ""information"" which led him to believe that his claim could not succeed.  If, as a consequence of that information, he could not reasonably have been expected to claim income support earlier, then the time for claiming for that period would be extended to the actual date of his claim, pursuant to regulations 19(4) & (5)(d) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987.  
A tribunal rejected the claim for backdating, and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the ""information"" referred to in regulation 19(5)(d) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 is not restricted to information given in respect of the claim in question.   It would include information given to the claimant on the ending of entitlement to income support in the summer of 1996.  If CIS/2682/1999 is to the contrary, it should not be followed (paras. 13 to 18); 
2. what needs to be established under regulation 19(5)(d) is that which the claimant was actually led to believe, rather than what the ""reasonable"" claimant would have been led to believe.  There is then a further test under regulation 19(4)(b) of whether, as a result of his belief, the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to claim earlier than he did (para. 14); 
3. the period of backdating allowable is limited to a maximum of three months.  That period, in regulation 19(4) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, is not aggregable with the period of up to one month which it is open to the Secretary of State to allow pursuant to regulation 19(6) (para. 19);
4. notwithstanding the literal wording, the three month period in regulation 19(4) is that falling immediately before the date of claim.  It does not run from the first day of the period claimed for (paras. 20 and 21).

The absent parent applied for a departure direction in respect of the repayment of debts incurred before he became an absent parent. The Secretary of State refused to make a direction. The absent parent appealed to a tribunal. The absent parent alleged that the loan in question was for water rates and similar household expenses. The tribunal confirmed the decision of the Secretary of State because such day to day living expenses were taken into account in the formula assessment, and that it was reasonable to exclude any loan to pay for them under regulation 16(2)(m) of the Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in the context of regulation 16(2) only extraordinary items of expenditure are to be excluded;
2.	the tribunal's reasoning was illogical because the application for a departure direction was based on debts incurred before he became an absent parent whereas the formula assessment took account of debts incurred afterwards;

The claimant had accepted a redundancy package which included a pension. He and his wife set up a business. They were later divorced. The claimant's wife continued to be employed in the business and the claimant arranged for his benefits under the pension scheme to be paid to her. Eventually the business had to be wound up and the claimant rescinded the instruction regarding the pension. The claimant's wife obtained a judgment against him part of which was enforced by an attachment of earnings order in terms of which £1,158.06 per month was deducted from the claimant's pension, the pension then being his only source of income. Having for some time claimed jobseeker's allowance the claimant made a claim for income support. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the basis that the occupational pension fell to be taken into account in the calculation of the claimant's entitlement. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal. The tribunal held that the pension in fact and in law belonged to the claimant, that payments from it still formed part of his income, that his debt to his ex-wife did not diminish his income, and that the pension was income for the purposes of calculating his entitlement to income support. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal that:
1.	it was not necessary to this decision to agree or disagree with the decision of the Commissioner in CIS/212/1989 (a case concerning the diversion of income to a trustee in bankruptcy);
2.	notwithstanding the differences in the facts, the approach of the Court of Appeal in Leeves v. the Chief Adjudication Officer (now reported as R(IS) 5/99), namely that ordinary words must be given their ordinary meaning, was applicable to this case; 
3.	regulations 32, 40(4), and 42(4) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 all refer to payment of (as opposed to entitlement to) income;
4.	the ordinary meaning of ""income"" is money paid regularly to the recipient or to his order but not money which is paid and which he cannot prevent from being paid directly to a third party; 
5.	the position remains the same following the amendment of regulation 42(4)(a) from 15 November 1999 by the addition of regulation 42(4)(a)(1a) since the payment of part of the claimant's occupational pension to the collecting officer does nothing for the claimant's support and so cannot be said to be made ""in respect"" of him.",1,111,,Earnings and other income: other income and payments,

Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 69,,"Housings costs - move to more expensive property - whether the test that change of dwelling was made solely by reason of the need to provide separate sleeping accommodation for children of different sexes be applied objectively or subjectively - whether the provision is ultra vires 

The claimant was in receipt of income support on grounds of incapacity. He was married with seven children, four boys, all over the age of ten, and three girls, all under ten. The family lived in an owner occupied house containing three bedrooms. The size of the rooms made it necessary for some of the boys and girls to share a bedroom. There was an outstanding mortgage of £19,000. On 10 May 1994 the family moved to a new house. It also had three bedrooms, but as the rooms were generally larger, it was no longer necessary for any of the boys to share with any of the girls. The claimant took out a mortgage of £34,000 to finance the purchase of the new house. He told the Benefits Agency that the reason for the move was to gain space.
On 2 May 1994 amending regulations came into force which introduced a new paragraph 5A into Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. Sub-paragraph (3) had the effect that, with certain exceptions, a person in receipt of income support who incurred a new liability to housing costs after 2 May would only have it met in the assessment of his benefit to the extent of any existing liability. The adjudication officer therefore decided to restrict the amount of housing costs allowed in the claimant's assessment to the amount allowed in respect of the previous house. 
The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, arguing that he came under the exceptions in either sub-paragraphs (8) or (9) of paragraph 5A, because the move was (a) in order to acquire accommodation more suited to the special needs caused by his disability; or (b) solely by reason of the need to provide separate sleeping accommodation for children of different sexes aged ten or over. The tribunal rejected the appeal, finding that (a) the facilities to provide for his disablement were no better at the new house than at the old; and (b) the need to provide separate sleeping accommodation for children of different sexes ""was not the sole reason, the reason was mainly to provide more adequate, i.e. roomy accommodation"". 
The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner, arguing that the tribunal had wrongly interpreted the meaning of the phrase 'solely by reason of' in sub-paragraph (9). At the hearing before the Commissioner it appeared that the exchange of contracts for the purchase of the new house might well have taken place before May 3. The Commissioner held, following CIS/2978/1995, that the tribunal had erred in law for failing to investigate this possibility and that the claimant should be regarded as having incurred the new liability on the date of exchange of contracts because that placed him under a legal obligation to pay the purchase price. However he found no error of law in the way that the tribunal had applied sub-paragraph 9. He suggested that in interpreting the phrase ""solely by reason of"", it was necessary to look primarily at the reasons for moving from the old home, rather than the reasons for choosing the particular new home. The case was remitted to a new tribunal.
It subsequently transpired that the exchange of contracts had taken place after May 2. The claimant therefore appealed to the Court of Appeal to dispute the Commissioner's ruling on the legal issues. He argued that sub-paragraph (9) should be interpreted as imposing an objective rather than a subjective test. However, if a subjective test was appropriate, the sub- paragraph would never apply, because there would in practice always be reasons for selecting the particular new home additional to the nature of the sleeping accommodation. Therefore the provision should be held to be ultra vires on the grounds that (a) it was irrational for the Secretary of State to make such a regulation; and (b) the Secretary of State had misled Parliament in his statement under section 174(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 by saying that the sub-paragraph would give effect to the relevant recommendation of the Social Security Advisory Committee. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	in applying sub-paragraph (9) of paragraph 5A of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, it was necessary to focus on the reason for the change of home. If the operative reason for the change of home was not the need to provide separate sleeping accommodation for children of different sexes of ten or over, the sub-paragraph would not apply. If the sole or exclusive reason for the change of home was the need to provide such accommodation, the sub-paragraph would apply even if the new home selected incidentally carried other benefits for the family (para. 19);
2.	on that interpretation, there was no difficulty in foreseeing situations in which sub-paragraph (9) could apply. Therefore there was no basis for finding it ultra vires on grounds of irrationality or misleading Parliament (paras. 22 and 29). In any event, due to the provisions of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, the Court could not entertain any argument to the effect that Parliament had been misled (para. 27).",1,174,,Income Support: housing costs,

The claimant claimed income support from January 1990 when she moved into a retirement home. During this time her son assisted her in relation to her financial affairs.  In July 1994 she sold her home and promptly declared the proceeds of sale.  Payment of income support ceased after                 6 July 1994.  In December 1994 the claimant executed a will in favour of her two daughters and appointed them as executors.  Around the same time an enduring power of attorney was granted to one of the daughters.  In early January 1995 the claimant's son informed the Department of Social Security that the claimant had in 1989 transferred some £40,000 to accounts in his name to enable her to claim income support
In February 1995 the adjudication officer reviewed and revised the decision awarding income support from January 1990 and decided that the claimant had received an overpayment of income support as she had misrepresented the amount of her capital in her application for benefit. The adjudication officer decided that the overpayment was recoverable from the claimant's son who still had some of the disposed monies in his account.  The son disputed this suggesting that the overpayment should also be recovered from the daughters.
No further action was taken until 1 June 1995 when the claimant died. The daughters promptly applied for a grant of probate.  However a dispute about the validity of the will arose amongst the siblings and the son entered a caveat against the daughters' application for a grant of probate.  Accordingly all accounts containing the claimant's monies were frozen.  
On the 15 June 1995, the adjudication officer reviewed and revised the February decision and decided that the overpayment was recoverable from the late claimant's estate.  The daughters appealed this decision.  The tribunal confirmed the adjudication officer's decision.
The daughters then applied to the Commissioner for leave to appeal the tribunal decision at which point the Commissioner's office requested sight of the grant of probate.  The grant was not produced and one of the daughters was appointed to ""proceed with the claim"" pursuant to regulation 30(1)  of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. The ground for appeal was that the adjudication officer and the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make a recoverability decision against the claimant's estate in the absence of a duly constituted personal representative.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	a deceased's claimant's estate is not a legal person and there is no power to make an overpayment recoverability decision under section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1972 against the claimant's estate or a person representing the estate without a grant of representation (paras. 33, 34 and 39);
2.	in the absence of a grant of representation in overpayment recoverability cases an appointment by the Secretary of State of a person to ""proceed with the claim"" under regulation 30(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulation 1987 cannot constitute the person appointed as representative of the claimant's estate so as to give an adjudication officer jurisdiction to make a decision against the claimant's estate (paras. 21 to 29);
3.	consequently, in the absence of a grant of representation, a person appointed under regulation 30(1) could not validly appeal on behalf of the estate so that  the appeal to the tribunal and Commissioner was a nullity (paras. 40 and 41);
4.	in the alternative the tribunal's decision be set aside in so far as necessary to do so (para. 41);
5.	R(IS) 12/94 not followed on the question of whether an estate as such had a recognised legal personality.

On 28 April 1997, the claimant received the proceeds of sale of her former home. On 7 May 1997 she claimed income support. She stated that she had set aside £37,000 out of the proceeds of sale to buy a new house but that having moved to a new area, she did not want to buy straightaway in case she did not like it. Her claim was disallowed because her capital exceeded £8,000. In her appeal to the tribunal she stated that she intended to work and get a mortgage to buy a house when her son went to school, but this would not be until September 1998. The tribunal held, dismissing her appeal, that there was no certainty that the claimant would find work and obtain a mortgage and that at most the claimant hoped that the proceeds of sale might be used at some future date for another home. They held that that was insufficient to show that the money ""is to be used"" for the purchase of a home as required by paragraph 3 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, SI 1987 No. 1967. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the essence of the words ""to be used"" in paragraph 3 was the need for an element of certainty, so that, to satisfy paragraph 3, a claimant must show not only that he or she intends to use the capital sum to buy another home but also that it is reasonably certain that he or she will in fact do so within the 26 week period following the sale of his or her previous home or such extended period as is reasonable;
2.	the reasonableness of any extension of the period would depend on the degree of uncertainty and the greater the uncertainty, the less reasonable any extension;

The claimant was married and lived with her husband in a house (No. 4) with no mortgage or loan secured on it. However, in 1987 the claimant's husband bought a public house, which included living accommodation, with the help of a loan secured on No. 4. A business account with an overdraft facility was opened, also secured on No. 4. The couple moved to live at the public house and let out No. 4. In 1988 a further business loan was taken out and secured on No. 4. The two loans and the overdraft were in the joint names of the claimant and her husband. In 1990 the claimant and her husband separated: the husband remained in the public house and the claimant went to live at No. 4 with her children. The claimant claimed income support as a lone parent. The adjudication officer included the interest on the two loans and the overdraft within the claimant's applicable amount. A further joint account became overdrawn and in 1994 the claimant rationalised the two loans and the two overdrafts into one mortgage, secured on No. 4. An adjudication officer reviewed the award of income support in relation to housing costs, allowing the interest representing the two loans but not that in respect of the overdrafts. The claimant appealed unsuccessfully to a social security appeal tribunal and then appealed further to the Commissioner. The Commissioner held that the interest on the loans should never have been included in the claimant's applicable amount because paragraph 7(7) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 required that the claimant occupied the home at the time the loans were taken out and that the claimant continued to live there after the former partner left. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, unanimously allowing the appeal, that the requirements of paragraph 7(7) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 were satisfied because:
1.	there were bank loans, to which the former partner was party, taken out and secured on the claimant's home;

Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 309,,"Asylum seeker - break in entitlement after Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 came into force - whether transitional protection applies to fresh claim 

The claimant was a Turkish national who arrived in the United Kingdom on 7 February 1994 and claimed asylum on 23 February 1994. He received income support at the urgent cases rate from 8 March 1995 as his claim for asylum had not been recorded as either finally determined or abandoned (regulation 70(3A) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987). Income support ceased to be paid on 12 August 1998 when he started remunerative employment. The employment ended on 4 September 1998 and he received jobseeker's allowance from 8 September 1998 until 7 March 1999. When that allowance was terminated, he claimed income support. His claim was rejected on the basis that regulation 70(3A) had been amended from 5 February 1996 to require the claim for asylum to be made ""on his arrival ...  in the United Kingdom"" and the saving provision in regulation 12(1) only applied to entitlement on the claim which was in existence on 5 February 1996. The tribunal confirmed the adjudication officer's decision and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner with leave from the chairman. The issue had arisen on the same facts in another appeal, CIS/1115/1999, and the question was decided against the claimant after an oral hearing. The Commissioner had followed CIS/3955/1997 and CIS/4609/1997 which also raised the same question but in relation to regulation 12(2).
 
Held, by the Commissioner, dismissing the appeal, that: 
the Commissioners' decisions in CIS/1115/1999, CIS/3955/1997 and CIS/4609/1997 had been reached after full argument at oral hearings and should be followed as the conclusion on the meaning was one which could reasonably have been reached. 

The Commissioner indicated that he might not have taken the same view had the question arisen afresh before him. He granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Held, by the Court of Appeal, allowing the appeal that: 
1.	transitional protection was not a term of art and nothing followed from the fact that a provision could be labelled as transitional (para. 9), the Court had to apply and construe the legislative language which the Secretary of State did in fact use i.e. the terms of regulation 12, in its different paragraphs, and not any supposed policy that the transitional protection should be minimal;
2.	unlike R v. Chief Adjudication Officer ex parte B [1999] 1 WLR 1695, where the court was driven to its conclusion by the specific words ""until such time as his entitlement to that benefit is reviewed"" in regulation 12(3), no such words were to be found in regulation 12(1) which addressed not the benefit in general terms but the specific case of a person ""who becomes an asylum seeker under regulation 70(3A)(a) of the Income Support Regulations"" i.e. a person who submitted a claim for asylum which remained undetermined on 5 February 1996. The effect of disapplying regulation 8(3)(c), was to continue the status of the applicant as an asylum seeker under the existing regulations which conferred on him the right to urgent cases payments under regulation 70. This right was not expunged simply by a period of employment;
3.	the fact of being entitled to benefit on 5 February 1996 was the precondition of the application of regulation 12(1) to the case (R v. Secretary of State ex parte Vijeikis, unreported            5 March 1998). Once the precondition was established, the operation of the transitional provisions was controlled by their terms and not by the precondition. The terms provided that the applicant continued to be entitled to claim because he continued to have the status of an asylum seeker for the purposes of the 1987 Regulations. The status was not lost by reason of a period of employment. It was lost after his asylum claim was finally determined;
4.	on the plain wording of regulation 12(1), the claimant's right to urgent cases payments under income support provisions did not disappear for all time as soon as he took employment. Those provisions continued subject to his fulfilling the other qualifying conditions until the determination of his asylum claim. If the Secretary of State had really wished to implement a policy of subjecting asylum seekers to a ""life so destitute that no civilised nation can tolerate it"" (per Simon Brown LJ in R v. Secretary of State ex parte JCWI [1997] 1 WLR at p. 92F), then he would have to use very clear words to that effect (para. 17).

The Commissioner's decision was set aside and a decision substituted to the effect that ""between the date of claim and 23 March 2000, the claimant was an asylum seeker with an income support applicable amount of the urgent cases payment rate.""",1,242,,Residence and presence conditions: persons from abroad,

At the age of 17 the claimant was involved in a catastrophic accident which left him permanently quadriplegic. In February 1992 the claimant was awarded income support, a claim having been made on his behalf by his father. In October 1992 the claimant received personal injury damages totalling over £1.5 million. From this sum over £1 million was placed in a structured settlement in the form of annuities which guaranteed future payments to the claimant. Details of the annuity payments were not provided to the Department and the claimant's income support continued to be drawn. The annuity payments came to light in 1996 and the adjudication officer issued a decision that the claimant had not been entitled to income support and that consequently there had been a large overpayment. The tribunal held that the annuity payments had to be included in the calculation of the claimant's income for income support  purposes and directed that the amount of income was to be calculated under regulation 53 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal, holding that the tribunal's directions under regulation 53, which provides for the calculation of ""tariff income"" from capital, were incorrect. The status of annuity payments for income support purposes was determined conclusively by regulation 41 of the 1987 regulations, regulation 41(2) prescribing that all payments received under an annuity are to be treated as income. The question of the recoverability of the overpayment was not pursued before the Commissioner.  The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The claimant was born in Somalia, but went to Holland to claim asylum during the civil war in Somalia. She obtained Dutch nationality. She entered the United Kingdom from Holland with her children on 10 January 1999. She was pregnant at the time. She claimed income support on 
14 January 1999. The reasons recorded for her coming to this country were that she was lonely and isolated in Holland, and she had come to England to learn English and to settle with her friends and relatives here. On 1 February 1999 an adjudication officer decided she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom and as a result she was a ""person from abroad"" as defined in regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and not entitled to income support. She appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, arguing that she was not subject to the habitual residence test as she was person with a right to reside in the United Kingdom pursuant to Council Directive 68/360/EEC or Council Directive 73/148/EEC. In support of the latter contention she said she was paying for football training for her children and for services from the Somalia Support Group, and that she was acting as a volunteer carer. She also argued that paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 6 and section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998, which prevented the tribunal from taking account of circumstances not obtaining at the time of the decision under appeal, was ultra vires. The tribunal dismissed the appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal but substituting a correctly reasoned decision to the same effect, that:
1.	paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 6 and section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 were not ultra vires and had the effect that account could not be taken of a period of residence after the date of the adjudication officer's decision (paras. 13 to 16);
2.	at the date of the adjudication officer's decision the claimant had been in the United Kingdom for less than a month, and as she had no previous personal connection the tribunal was entitled to hold that she had not been resident for an appreciable period (para. 17); 
3.	the claimant was not able to rely on the decision of the European Court of Justice in Swaddling v. Adjudication Officer (R(IS) 6/99) to claim an exemption from the requirement to establish an appreciable period of residence as the terms of that decision were closely confined to the facts of that case and concerned the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, whereas the claimant's circumstances fell outside the scope of that Regulation (para. 36); 
4.	the claimant did not have status as a worker in the United Kingdom for the purposes of Council Directive 68/360/EEC because status as a worker must be established in a Member State before any right against that State is acquired by that status and the claimant had not worked in the United Kingdom at the date of the adjudication officer's decision, and any work she may have undertaken in another Member State or on a voluntary basis was irrelevant (para. 22);
5.	Council Directive 73/148/EEC was concerned with the cross-border provision of services and if there was no cross-border element in a case, it did not apply - although the case-law referred to the duration of the services, that was not the decisive consideration but was merely of evidentiary value because if a person went to a State to receive a service provided by someone within that State and that service was going to be received indefinitely, that showed the person had become established there and as both provider and recipient were in the same State, the Directive did not apply (para. 32);
6.	the evidence showed that the claimant came to this country in order to settle here and to be closer to her friends and family rather than to provide or receive any of the services identified in the evidence, and although the services may be received or provided for only a finite period the intended duration of her residence took her outside the scope of Council Directive 73/148/EEC, as it removed any cross-border element from the provision and receipt of those services (para. 33).",1,125,242,European Union law: workers; Residence and presence conditions: persons from abroad,

The claimant was a single woman living with her parents as a member of their household. She was in receipt of income support and attendance allowance (which was later replaced by disability living allowance). On 31 July 1990 she appealed against an adjudication officer's decision of 27 July 1990 refusing to award severe disability premium, relying on a decision of the Commissioner (CIS/787/1991) which was later the subject of appeal to the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords in Chief Adjudication Officer v. Bate (R(IS) 12/96). On 24 July 1992 a tribunal awarded her severe disability premium for the period 11 April 1988 to 8 October 1989 and adjourned for later consideration of the subsequent period. On 6 March 1995 a tribunal heard the appeal in respect of the period from 9 October 1989 and awarded severe disability premium up to 1 December 1994 in the light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Bate given on 30 November 1994, remitting the matter to the adjudication officer for calculation. The period from 2 December 1994 onwards was adjourned pending further submissions from both parties as amending Regulations had come into force from that date and the claimant argued that they were not intended to apply to existing claimants. On 
16 May 1996 the decision of the House of Lords in Bate reversed the effect of the Court of Appeal's judgment. On 17 August 1999 a tribunal hearing the reconvened appeal found that the tribunal of 
6 March 1995 had conclusively dealt with the period 9 October 1989 to 1 December 1994 and it did not have jurisdiction to reopen the appeal in relation to that period, and accepted the claimant's withdrawal of the appeal in respect of the period from 2 December 1994. The adjudication officer applied to the chairman for leave to appeal to the Commissioner which was granted, but following representations from the claimant's representative that there had been no decision against which an appeal could be made the chairman purported to rescind the grant of leave. Nevertheless the Commissioner heard the appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that: 
1.	the decision of the 1999 tribunal represented a declining of jurisdiction and the question of whether the tribunal had jurisdiction or not was a question of law which the Commissioner could consider (para. 25);
2.	once a Chairman had given leave to appeal to the Commissioner, he was functus officio and he had no power thereafter to vary or rescind his grant of leave (para. 26);
3.	the part of the decision of the tribunal of 6 March 1995 awarding severe disability premium from 9 October 1989 to 1 December 1994 was a final decision and consequently the decision of the tribunal of 17 August 1999 that it had no jurisdiction to rehear or reopen the appeal in relation to that period was correct in law (para. 22);
4.	it was competent to a tribunal finally to decide one part of an appeal period or one issue that is under appeal to it and then to adjourn another issue and, although it may well be that a tribunal ought not normally to do this, in the circumstances of this case it was clear that, in view of the changes in the legislation and the complicated nature of the caselaw, the tribunal of 1995 did all that it possibly could do and acted quite properly in adjourning the period from and including 2 December 1994 (para. 24).",1,277,283,Tribunal practice and procedure: leave to appeal to the Commissioners; Tribunal practice and procedure: tribunal jurisdiction,

Practice - conflicting Commissioner's decisions - approach to be adopted in deciding which should be followed

The claimant in 1989 took out a mortgage secured on his home which was linked with an endowment policy. A few days later he took out an income protection policy with a friendly society to provide against the contingency of his becoming incapable of following his occupation.  In 1993 he became permanently incapable of work due to an accident. He claimed on the friendly society policy and began to receive a regular income under it. However he continued to pay the premiums on the policy as the terms of the policy provided that he would lose the income if he fell into arrears of four months or more. The claimant also claimed income support as a result of his incapacity for work and the friendly society income was taken into account in full in the assessment. He appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, which on 11 September 1997 held that the assessment was correct. He appealed to the Commissioner. Issues raised in the appeal included whether there could be disregarded from the friendly society income amounts in respect of (a) the premiums on the friendly society policy; (b) the mortgage interest payments; (c) the premiums on the endowment policy; (d) the premiums on the claimant's buildings insurance policy. Some of the issues concerned had been considered in earlier Commissioner's decisions, which on some points were in conflict.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	where there are two conflicting Commissioner's decisions on a point and the earlier decision had been fully considered in the later decision, the later decision should be followed unless the Commissioner is convinced that it was wrong, for instance because some binding or persuasive authority had not been cited. Colchester Estates (Cardiff) v. Carlton Industries PLC [1986] Ch80 applied (para. 4);
2.	the reasoning in Chief Adjudication Officer v. Hogg [1985] 1WLR 1100 (also appendix to R(FIS) 4/85), allowing for the deduction from an item of income of expenses incurred in obtaining it, does not apply to the calculation of income other than earnings to be taken into account in determining entitlement to income support. CIS/563/1991 followed rather than CIS/25/1989 because it was the later case and CIS/25/1989 had been considered in detail in it (para. 4);
3.	income received under an insurance policy can only be disregarded under paragraph 29 of Schedule 9 to the Income Support (General) Regulations1987 (""Schedule 9"") if the policy provides strictly for mortgage protection rather than income protection, even if it was taken out with the possibility of being unable to make payments relating to a mortgage particularly in mind (para. 5);
4.	income received under an insurance policy providing for income protection can be disregarded under paragraph 30 of Schedule 9 if the claimant is in fact making payments for any of the purposes specified in the paragraph. It can be assumed that the income was ""intended to be used"" for those purposes and, where the claimant has other sources of income, that the payments are being made from the income under the policy (para. 6);
5.	where an endowment policy is assigned to a lender as collateral security for a loan, the premiums on the policy can be regarded as a payment due on the loan attributable to the payment of capital for the purpose of paragraph 30(1)(c) of Schedule 9. CIS/642/1992 followed rather than CIS/13059/1996 even though it was the earlier decision because it gave more consideration to the issue and was not referred to in CIS/13059/1996 (para. 10);
6.	only an insurance policy that provides solely for mortgage protection can be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 30(1)(d)(i) of Schedule 9 (para. 11);

The claimant and her husband took out a loan when purchasing their home in 1990. Under the agreement, only part of the interest due on the loan was to be paid during the first three years. The lender then opened a secondary account, capitalising the interest unpaid during those three years and charging interest on that amount at the same rate as on the main loan.  When the claimant claimed income support in 1996, the adjudication officer decided that only interest on the primary loan was applicable as a housing cost, because only that loan qualified under paragraph 15(1) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as amended with effect from 2 October 1995.  The claimant appealed, claiming interest on the secondary account as part of her housing costs.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

1.	only the primary loan was used for the purpose of acquiring an interest in the dwelling;
2.	the capitalised sum in the secondary account was to be treated as a loan;

He did not work during school holidays and was not paid for holidays.

The claimant claimed income support in the summer holiday of 1996 and he claimed jobseeker's allowance during the autumn half-term holiday.  Both claims were disallowed on the ground that he was in remunerative work during the holidays and a tribunal dismissed his appeals.  He appealed to a Commissioner who heard his appeals with the appeal of another claimant whose wife was employed in a school.  The Commissioner allowed the appeals, holding that a person is engaged in remunerative work during any part of a cycle of work taken into account in establishing the number of hours worked, except during periods when on maternity leave or when absent from work because of sickness.  Therefore, he held that the claimant was not to be regarded as engaged in remunerative work during the holidays, because those parts of the cycle of work were not taken into account in establishing the number of hours worked.  He also held that the school holidays were not holidays for the claimant and that the claimant's term-time earnings were to be disregarded during school holidays.  The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal (Auld and Aldous LJJ and Rattee J) who reversed the Commissioner's decisions and held that the claimant was engaged in remunerative work during the school holidays  [2000] 1 All ER 686.

The claimant was receiving jobseeker's allowance. On 4 August 1997 he was taken into police custody where he was detained for 42 hours. He was released without charge. The adjudication officer decided that, owing to the detention, the claimant was not available for employment in the week 
31 July 1997 to 6 August 1997, nor could he be treated as so available. Accordingly, the claimant was not entitled to jobseeker's allowance for that week. The tribunal held partially in the claimant's favour that he was only disentitled to jobseeker's allowance for two days, and so was entitled to five sevenths of his weekly benefit.
The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner decided the appeal in the claimant's favour. Section 1(3) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Act 1995 provides that jobseeker's allowance is payable in respect of a week, and that there was no provision (other than by exceptions which were not relevant in this case) to award the benefit for parts of a week. The claimant's detention in police custody fell within regulation 13(3) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 which provides that ""A person may restrict his availability in any way providing that the restrictions are reasonable in the light of his physical or mental condition."" Here, the claimant's physical condition was that he was in police custody and, as such, was not free either in practical or legal terms to leave, so that any restriction upon his availability was not only reasonable, but also inevitable. 
The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the reference in regulation 13(3) to the claimant's ""physical or mental condition"" is confined to some personal disability;
2.	the provision applies prospectively only and specifically with regard to the completion of the jobseeker's agreement;
3.	(obiter) it is not easy to see why a claimant should lose his weekly jobseeker's allowance merely by being detained by the police when during such detention he must be presumed innocent. There is a lacuna in the legislation with regard to unforeseen circumstances. The matters are sufficiently troubling to suggest that the Secretary of State ought properly to consider amending the scheme to grant some measure of discretion to adjudication officers to deal with cases like this where the claimant is unavailable for work through unforeseen and excusable circumstances.",1,210,,Jobseeker's allowance: availability for employment,

The claimant claimed industrial injuries disablement benefit for prescribed disease A11. He was examined by a medical officer who reported that no blanching was described. The claimant appealed.

The enquiry form states ?You must send in extra evidence with this form, or let the Independent Tribunal Service know when you will be able to send it?. The claimant wrote he would send it in as soon as he received it. The tribunal hearing went ahead before the report had been received. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the hearing should not have taken place until the report had been received, and that the report, obtained by the Department of Trade and Industry, indicated that the claimant did suffer from the disease.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the decision must be set aside because it was unfair to proceed without the claimant?s report;
2.	the Department of Trade and Industry report, the medical officer?s report, and the claimant?s own evidence indicated that he suffered from the neurological effects of hand-arms vibration syndrome e.g. numbness, or tingling, or reduced tactile discrimination, but not the vascular effects of hand-arms vibration syndrome. Prescribed disease A11 is prescribed in the form of one of the vascular effects, namely ?episodic blanching?.

From 1992, each year the claimants (who were husband and wife) lived for most of the year in New Zealand but came back to Britain for a single period of between two and six months. On 9 April 1998 an adjudication officer decided that they were not entitled to the annual up-ratings of retirement pension from 10 April 1995 on the ground that they were not ordinarily resident in Britain immediately before that date, pursuant to reg. 5 of the Social Security Benefit (Person Abroad) Regulations 1975. The claimants appealed to a social security appeal tribunal. In evidence they confirmed that in future, so long as they could travel, they planned to spend eight months in New Zealand and four months in Britain. They explained that they did not travel to other countries and they never left Britain without buying return tickets. The reason for their arrangements was that there were domestic problems in the family and the wife was looking after their grandchildren for part of the time. She had been granted residency rights in New Zealand to prevent her being an overstayer under New Zealand immigration law. Although the husband travelled with and stayed with his wife, he did not claim residency rights in New Zealand. They made the point that they were both British nationals who had had their home in Britain for 43 years together before the present dispute started. The wife retained the home in Britain (although she was trying to sell it during the later part of the period) which was available for them both to live in at any time, but because of their family commitments they had also set up home in New Zealand. The British pension was a main source of income, and they received no New Zealand pension. Income tax was paid in Britain during at least part of the period in issue. There were some inconsistencies in their statements about their longer term intentions and where they lived and where they intended to live. For example in September 1997 the wife had completed a form to the effect that she was leaving Britain permanently as from March 1995 but when this was queried by the Department of Social Security, she wrote in October 1997 to point out that she had been back to Britain for extended periods three times since then. She also stated in another letter in 1997 that she was a permanent resident in New Zealand but in that letter she also suggested that her husband was retaining British links. However, all the statements to which the husband put his name were to the effect that he remained ordinarily resident in Britain. The tribunal found the claimants were ordinarily resident in New Zealand and dismissed their appeal, and they appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that: 
1.	the question was whether, immediately before 10 April 1995, or on any other relevant subsequent date, the claimants had ceased to be ordinarily resident in Great Britain, which was a question of fact in all the circumstances and there was no special meaning attached to ""ordinarily resident"" in this context - it was the ordinary meaning of the words that applied (para. 17);
2.	the question of whether the claimants had ceased to be ordinarily resident was not the same thing as asking whether they had ceased to be habitually resident in Great Britain (para. 17);
3.	having found the claimants were ordinarily resident in New Zealand the tribunal concluded they must have ceased to be ordinarily resident in Britain, which was wrong because it was not an either/or question - they could be ordinarily resident in both countries and the fact that the claimants, or either of them, had become resident or ordinarily resident in New Zealand was only one part of the factual picture to be taken into account in assessing if either or both had given up their ordinary residence in Britain (para. 17);
4.	the starting point was that the claimants were long term ordinary residents of Britain for many years before the visits to New Zealand started and for that reason, and as the decisions were review decisions, the onus was on the Secretary of State to show that the circumstance of ordinary residence in Britain had changed in each case, and when it had changed (para. 19);
5.	it was necessary for the Secretary of State and tribunal to consider all the facts available at the time of their respective decisions to see what pattern of life the claimants had, whether those facts occurred before, during, or after the period of benefit under consideration, as there was no fixed time attached to the period that could be reviewed in identifying it, and the temporal limits in the Social Security Act 1998 would not affect this if they were applicable, because the ""circumstance"" was whether the claimant was or was not ordinarily resident, and in the case of a tribunal it was only if the evidence showed a change of circumstances occurring after the decision of the Secretary of State that the tribunal should stop looking (para. 23);
6.	a decision by the Inland Revenue on the question of the claimants' ordinary residence would not have been binding on the tribunal or the Commissioner (para. 13);
7.	taking into account the following facts, the balance of probabilities was that the claimants were and remained ordinarily resident in Britain (paras. 20 to 22): 
(i)	Britain had been, until the events in issue, their long term home, and they still had a home there at all relevant times which was not occupied by anyone else (even though they tried to sell it);
(ii)	by reason of their pensions their strongest economic ties were with Britain which was and remained the source of their main income and was a country where one at least was paying tax;
(iii)	there was a clear pattern over several years (at least seven) of extended periods spent in both Britain and New Zealand but at no time did a full year go by without an extended visit back to Britain and by 1998 the claimants had established a clear pattern of extended residence in both Britain and New Zealand, which was particularly important as the claimants had a settled pattern of living of the kind within the views of Lord Warrington of Clyffe in Levene v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue [1928] AC 217 (at 232);
(iv)	although their intentions appeared to be inconsistent, the inconsistency could be explained in part because they were reacting to family circumstances beyond their control which argued for their presence in New Zealand for at least one extended period, and, taking an overall view of their statements, there was not any unambiguous statement by them that they were indefinitely leaving Britain, it was not proved that at any time they left Britain without any definite intention to return, and there was no evidence to suggest that both claimants acted otherwise than together throughout, whatever separately they might have said about future intentions.",1,241,,Residence and presence conditions: ordingary residence,

The claimant was profoundly deaf with little speech. His first language was British Sign Language and his lip reading was not good. He sought the middle rate care component on attention grounds, stating that he required assistance when attending workplace and other meetings, with correspondence and with a variety of social and other activities. The second tribunal (the decision of the first tribunal having been set aside by a Commissioner) awarded the lowest rate care component and the claimant appealed. The Commissioner considered the relevant statutory provisions and authorities, in particular the decision in Secretary of State for Social Security v. Fairey [R(A) 2/98], in which the House of Lords held (inter alia) that the provision of a signing interpreter is capable of constituting ?attention? and the test to be applied by fact finders is whether the attention was reasonably required to enable the disabled person as far as possible to live a normal life.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	very many of the instances where deaf claimants reasonably require help (such as visits  to doctors, parent/teacher evenings and interest group meetings) do not occur often enough in a single day to count as ?frequent? attention throughout that day, or even to occupy a significant portion of that day, although decision makers are entitled to aggregate (in effect, average) them to conclude that a requirement for attention for a significant portion of most days is shown;
2.	the correct approach to fact finding is, first, to ascertain whether communication in the claimant?s current daily life would be made significantly more efficient or effective by the use of an interpreter, having regard to the practicability and desirability of having one in attendance;
3.	fact finders should then apply the same considerations to what the claimant might like to do if help was available, but additionally having regard to the feasability of fitting such activities in with other commitments;
4.	while in many cases the extra effort involved in initiating communication will be de minimis, fact finders must properly investigate allegations of such needs;
5.	extra effort in signing, speaking more loudly, articulating to facilitate lip-reading, or writing/reading notes does not automatically count as relevant attention but must be assessed in the context in which it occurs;

A claim by the claimant for jobseeker's allowance was disallowed by a decision maker because the claimant had paid no contributions in the two years relevant to the claim. The claimant appealed to a tribunal on the ground that she had been employed from April 1994 to 31 August 2000 and that national insurance contributions had been deducted from her salary but not passed on to the Inland Revenue. The tribunal had before it three pay slips showing contributions having been deducted, but there was no evidence that the Inland Revenue had actually collected contributions in respect of the claimant for the Department of Social Security. As the claimant had produced no evidence that she was being treated by the Inland Revenue as having paid contributions pursuant to regulation 39 of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 1979 as amended (""the 1979 Regulations"") and, since contributions give no entitlement to benefit until they have actually been paid (regulations 38(5) and (6) as amended of the 1979 Regulations), the appeal was dismissed by the tribunal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal's decision was erroneous in law because the tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide whether under regulation 39 of the 1979 Regulations contributions should be treated as having been paid.

The claimant (an Italian national) paid both British and Italian social security contributions in the course of his working life. In 1979 he retired and claimed a UK retirement pension, such claim being disallowed. He was, however, awarded a small amount of graduated retirement benefit (GRB). From November 1980 he was also awarded supplementary benefit. Payment of GRB was subsequently interrupted from 1981 to 1985, apparently on the ground that the Department had lost touch with the claimant. Meanwhile, the claimant had also claimed an Italian retirement pension, for which his Italian contributions, when taken alone, proved to be insufficient. However, in 1993 the relevant Italian authority reached a decision on the application of the aggregation and apportionment rules in Articles 44 to 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71. It awarded an Italian retirement pension from August 1979 and sent the claimant's arrears (£26,604.46) to the Department of Social Security. The latter had also applied Reg. 1408/71 and had awarded a UK retirement pension from December 1979, such decision being notified to the claimant on 7 December 1993. No award of pension was made for the period during which the payment of GRB had been interrupted. On an unknown date, an adjudication officer decided that there had been a recoverable overpayment of supplementary benefit and income support in the sum of £24,950.24, on the grounds that the benefits would not have been paid had the Italian pension been paid on the proper dates. On 12 August 1996 the claimant was notified of an alteration in the calculation of the overpayment. The claimant appealed. The tribunal gave effect to a small correction in the overpayment calculation, but otherwise ruled that the Secretary of State was entitled to receive the amount of £21,363.93 out of the arrears under section 74(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The tribunal applied the decision in CIS/12082/1996 which provided that nothing in Reg. 1408/71 or in Council Reg. (EEC) No. 574/72 (on permissible recovery procedures) prevented the application of section 74(2) in cases like the claimant's.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who held an oral hearing. Firstly, in relation to Reg. 574/72, the claimant argued that CIS/12082/1996 was wrong per se, and that, additionally, since the amendment to Reg. 1408/71 in June 1992 (creating the category of special non-contributory benefit), Article 111 of Reg. 574/72 might have no application to recovery of overpayments of income support due to the late receipt of other benefits from Member States. Secondly, in relation to the calculation of ""pro rata"" benefit under Reg. 1408/71, the claimant argued that where supplementary benefit or income support was paid to bring income from a contributory old age benefit up to a minimum level of subsistence, such benefit was within the meaning of ""supplementary allowance"" within Article 1(t) of Reg. 1408/71. As such it was to be taken into account as part of the old age benefits from which the ""theoretical amount"" and the pro rata benefits were to be calculated under Articles 45 and 46. Such an approach would produce a higher UK pro rata benefit for the claimant, which, it was submitted, could not be touched by section 74(2). In making this submission the claimant relied on Swaddling v Adjudication Officer [R(IS) 6/99] to challenge the view expressed in Perry v Chief Adjudication Officer [R(IS) 4/99] that supplementary benefit and income support are not a social security benefit within Article 4(1) of Reg. 1408/71 because they are general social benefits not linked to protection against any of the specific risks listed in Article 4(1). The claimant also sought to rely on the principle laid down by the ECJ in Stinco and Panfilo v Istitutio Nazionale della Providenza Sociale (Case-132/96) [1998] ECR I-5225. In that case the ECJ had held that a supplement, intended to bring a pension to a statutory minimum level, should be included when calculating the theoretical amount under Article 46 and that it did not matter for that purpose that the supplement was listed as a special non-contributory benefit in Annex IIa to Reg. 1408/71. In the present case, supplementary benefit and income support operated practically as a supplement to the claimant's retirement pension (and GRB) and defined a statutory minimum level of income, so that they should be treated in the same way as the Italian supplement in Stinco and Panfilo. Thirdly, the claimant also made submissions with regard to the calculation of the ""relevant amount"" under section 74(2).

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:
1.	CIS/12082/1996 was correct in relation to the period before 1992 for the reasons given in that decision, and, as Article 111 did not prevent the application of section 74(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, that result can only be reinforced following the amendment of Regulation 1408/71;
2.	in terms of binding authority, the reasoning of the Advocate General in Swaddling fell far short of the view accepted by the Court of Appeal in Perry that that income support did not fall within the scope of Article 4(1);
3.	furthermore, supplementary benefit and income support are so different from the kind of benefit involved in Stinco and Panfilo that they cannot be regarded as part of the benefits to be taken into account under Article 46 of Reg. 1408/71, even with the extension required by the definition in Article 1(t) (such a conclusion resting on the nature of supplementary benefit and income support as general social benefits not specifically linked to protection against any of the risks listed in Article 4(1));
4.	a ""supplementary allowance"" within Article 1(t) is one which has specific connections with a specific social security benefit: it does not extend to a general social benefit which may provide a practical supplement to recipients of specific social security benefits, but which provides an income to others in many different circumstances whose resources are inadequate for their needs;
5.	accordingly the calculation of the claimant's UK pro rata pension was properly restricted to consideration of the retirement pension earned by his contributions in the UK and taking into account his contributions made in Italy (GRB having properly been excluded from that calculation by reason of Reg. 1408/71, Annex VI, Section O, point 8);
6.	with regard to the calculation of the amount recoverable under section 74(2), the tribunal had erred by taking the view that because the decision of 7 December 1993 was not under appeal, it could not take account of the claimant's entitlement to retirement pension and GRB: a broader approach should have been taken as the question is the identification of what supplementary benefit or income support ""would not have been paid"" if the Italian pension had been paid on its due dates, and there is no requirement of a review of the previous supplementary benefit or income support decision (or now a revision or supersession) to establish the amount overpaid.

The Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision, found facts and substituted his own decision to the effect that in the light of his conclusions on the European issues there was nothing to prevent the operation of section 74(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 in the present case on the basis that the claimant's pro rata retirement pension had been correctly calculated as set out in paragraphs 11 to 22 of the Commissioner's decision and that the ""relevant amount"" under section 74(2) was £20,705.66.",1,119,234,,

The claimant was employed for 12 hours a week as a trainer at a child-care centre during term-time only.  She was paid monthly.  Her claim for contribution-based jobseeker's allowance for the autumn half-term holiday in 1998 was refused on the ground that her income exceeded her applicable amount.  She appealed, arguing that she was not an employed earner during the half-term holiday and therefore her earnings were not to be taken into account as income.  The tribunal decided that she was an employed earner during the holiday and dismissed her appeal.  
Held, setting aside the tribunal's decision but substituting a decision to the same practical effect, that:

1.	the question for the tribunal was not whether the claimant was an employed earner during the week of her claim but whether the earnings she had received from such employment were attributable to that week for the purposes of either section 2(1)(c) or section 4(1)(b) of the Jobseekers Act 1995, which provided respectively for loss of entitlement and for reduction of benefit where earnings exceeded prescribed amounts (paragraph 8);

2.	there appeared to be no statutory provision attributing earnings to any particular period for the purposes of section 2(1)(c) (paragraph 10);
	
3.	for the purposes of section 4(1)(b), the claimant's earnings were to be taken into account over a period of a month beginning with the first day of the benefit week in which the earnings were due to be paid (regulations 80(1) and 94(2)(a) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 and (R(IS) 10/95) but, if the claimant had ceased to be engaged in the relevant employment, the earnings were to be disregarded under regulation 99(2) of, and paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to, the Jobseekers Regulations 1996 (paragraphs 11 and 12);

4.	the effect of regulation 51(2)(c) of the 1996 Regulations and Banks v. Chief Adjudication Officer [2001] UKHL 33 (reported as R(IS) 15/01), was that, where a person worked at a school or other educational establishment or at some other place of employment and the cycle of work consisted of one year but with school holidays or similar vacations during which he or she did no work, that person was to be regarded as engaged in employment (whether remunerative work or part-time employment) during the whole of the cycle of work including the holidays or vacations (paragraph 14);

5.	it followed that the claimant was to be treated as engaged in part-time employment during the week of her claim, that earnings attributed to that week were not to be disregarded and that, as those earnings exceeded the amount prescribed under section 4(1)(b), the amount of benefit to which she was entitled (even if she was not prevented by section 2(1)(c) from having an underlying entitlement) was nil (paragraph 15).

[Note: In R(JSA) 4/03, a Tribunal of Commissioners held that regulation 51(2)(c) was inconsistent with Council Directive 79/7/EEC and should be regarded as being of no effect, so that regulation 51(2)(b)(i) applied instead.]",1,106,108,,

The claimant, a former bus driver, made a claim for industrial injuries disablement benefit on the ground that he was suffering from Prescribed Disease D7 (occupational asthma) the cause of his asthma being the exposure to diesel fumes and dust that his work driving buses through heavy traffic in the centre of London necessarily involved. There was no dispute that the claimant had and continued to have severe chronic asthma which had been much worse when he was at work because of exposure to cold air and diesel and other fumes and improved when he was away from work and avoided these conditions. The only question for the tribunal was whether the claimant's asthma was due to exposure to any of the list of specified agents in the sub-paragraphs of condition D7 in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985 SI No 967 as in force from 26 September 1991 when additional categories of agent were introduced including the one claimed by the claimant to be applicable to him: ""(x) any other sensitising agent"". The tribunal recorded that the medical evidence did not support the claimant's strongly held view that it had been the diesel fumes that were the original cause of his asthma (although there was agreement that his work exacerbated his condition) and dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
it is quite clear from the report of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council dated 28 August 1990, which led to the additional categories of agent being introduced, that the expression ""sensitising agent"" when used medically in this context means a chemical agent which actually causes a person to develop an asthmatic condition when inhaled at work rather than one which merely exacerbates an existing condition; and that in the absence of medical evidence that the diesel fumes were the original cause of the claimant's asthma the tribunal had reached the only decision they reasonably could have done on the claim.",1,197,,,

In January 1991, the claimant made a claim for industrial injuries disablement benefit in respect of Vibration White Finger (PD A11). On 6 September 1991, an adjudicating medical authority decided that he was not suffering from PD A11 and had not so suffered since 8 August 1985. The claimant did not appeal. In October 1995 the claimant made a fresh claim for disablement benefit in respect of the same prescribed disease and, on appeal, a medical appeal tribunal on 10 March 1998 found that the claimant was suffering from PD A11 and had so suffered since 1 January 1986 (the date of onset). There was a purported correction of the tribunal decision to change the date of onset to 7 September 1991. The claimant made a late appeal to the Commissioner. 

The claimant had made a separate claim for reduced earnings allowance on the basis of loss of earnings as a result of suffering from PD A11 from 1 October 1986. An adjudication officer rejected this claim and the claimant's appeal was adjourned pending a final decision on his disablement benefit appeals.
The Commissioner set out the test to be applied in determining the date of onset in PD A11 cases.  It was agreed before him that the ""correction"" of the medical appeal tribunal decision was not permissible and that the decision should be set aside and remitted to a new appeal tribunal. The parties did not agree about the terms of the remittal. The Commissioner held that where a claim for disablement benefit in respect of a prescribed disease had been refused, a decision maker deciding a later claim for the same benefit could not find a date of onset prior to the date of refusal of the first claim. The same applied to two claims for reduced allowance. However, on a later claim for reduced earnings allowance, a decision maker was required after 5 July 1999 to determine the date of onset as a question of fact and the determination on the claim for disablement benefit that a claimant did not have a prescribed disease was not binding on the decision maker deciding the reduced earnings allowance claim. 

The Secretary of State appealed.  

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	a decision on date of onset is final and binds any subsequent decision maker dealing with a claim for disablement benefit or reduced earnings allowance. 
2.	it is not open to a decision maker or tribunal to find that a claimant 

began to suffer from a  loss of faculty as a result of a prescribed disease during a period in respect of which it has already been decided that he did not suffer from the PD in question;

3.	the decision of the adjudicating medical authority dated 6 September 1991 on the first claim for disablement benefit  was final and binding both for the second claim for disablement benefit and the claim for reduced earnings allowance. Accordingly the date of onset of PD A11 could not be determined to be any earlier than 6 September 1991 and the claimant was not entitled to reduced earnings allowance;

4.	(obiter) a claim for reduced earnings allowance cannot be made without a pre existing claim for disablement benefit and an assessment of at least 1%;",1,183,205,,

The claimant's claim for disability living allowance was treated as made on 26 April 2000. It was refused and the claimant appealed to the appeal tribunal. By the time of the hearing she had made a successful claim, for which the effective date of award was 27 September 2000 (although the tribunal knew only that the award was dated sometime in September). The tribunal, while minded to make an award, declined to do so on the basis that the claimant did not satisfy the provisions of section 72(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. In the claimant's case, the qualifying period in section 72(2)(a) was not satisfied until 28 July 2000 (which was therefore the earliest date on which an award could begin). However, section 72(2)(b) also required that the claimant was likely to continue to satisfy the substantive conditions of entitlement throughout the period of six months beginning with the earliest date of award. As the claimant was already in receipt of an award from September, the tribunal found that her case did not satisfy the latter requirement.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	section 72(2)(b) does not in its terms limit the period of award which can be made; 
2.	rather, it only imposes a requirement that it must be likely that one of the conditions of entitlement set out in section 72(1) will be satisfied for a further six months - if a claimant's disablement is likely to last for longer it is irrelevant that part of that period is covered by a later award.

Following violence by her husband, the claimant left the matrimonial home where she had resided for approximately thirty years. Fearing her husband, she brought neither divorce proceedings, nor proceedings for judicial separation, and consequently she made no applications either in respect of the property or for maintenance. She was rehoused by the local authority, having previously written to it (for the purposes of securing that rehousing) stating that she waived her right to receive any sum from her previous home. On 12 January 2000 the decision maker refused her claim for income support on the grounds that she was deemed to possess notional capital in excess of the £8000 limit. This was said to be the amount which she would have received from the matrimonial home if she had not waived her right to receive such a sum. The claimant appealed to the tribunal. In fact, subsequent to her departure from the matrimonial home, the property was sold by her husband and the proceeds applied to the purchase of another property which had then been let out. The tribunal found that the claimant had had an equitable interest in the matrimonial home by virtue of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 which had followed the proceeds of sale into the property bought by the husband. That equitable interest thus represented actual capital to which the claimant would have been entitled had she taken appropriate proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The tribunal therefore dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner, before whom the Secretary of State argued that the claimant had deprived herself of her interest by failing to take legal proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to make orders for financial provision and property adjustment is a statutory one which arises on the granting of a decree of divorce, a decree of nullity of marriage or a decree of separation or at any time thereafter (paragraph 9);
2.	a property adjustment order is one that one of the parties transfers to the other one specified property, however while this can include the transfer of an equitable interest, that transfer cannot be made in derogation of the rights of third parties (paragraph 11);
3.	the claimant could not have any equitable interest in any property by virtue of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 unless and until a property adjustment order was made: for example if either party were to die before a decree of divorce or judicial separation were pronounced she would have nothing, similarly if a third party (such as a mortgagee) had exercised its rights so as to absorb the potential sum available (paragraph 12);
4.	the claimant's rights under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 were not such as to give her any equitable interest in any particular property, rather she had a right contingent on her applying for and obtaining either a decree of divorce or judicial separation to seek maintenance payments, a lump sum payment and a property adjustment order (paragraph 13);
5.	such orders might, on the facts of this case, be expected to result in the claimant having either or both an income or a capital sum well in excess of £8000 (paragraph 13);
6.	however, this contingent right cannot properly be regarded as capital at all - it is no more a capital asset than a spouse's legal right to be supported by the other spouse which has never been treated as capital, furthermore, the contingent right cannot be legally sold or charged (paragraph 14);
7.	as it is not a capital asset, no question of the claimant depriving herself of the asset can arise (paragraph 16);
8.	in any event the evidence in the case showed that the claimant's reasons for not bringing proceedings were not to deprive herself of an asset to obtain income support (paragraph 17).

The Deputy Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal and substituted his own that the claimant's entitlement to income support was to be calculated without regard to any potential right to any capital provision which might be made in the future under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 upon the granting of a divorce or judicial separation, and that the claimant had not deprived herself of any capital for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support by not bringing proceedings for a divorce or judicial separation in or prior to January 2000.",1,25,,,

On renewal, the award of the care component was reduced to the lowest rate for attention during the day. That decision was reviewed but not revised by the adjudication officer. An appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officer's decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on a number of grounds which were considered at an oral hearing. The appeal was supported by the Secretary of State.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the decision under appeal was an ""any ground"" review under section 30(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and although it fell to be treated, under transitional provisions, as a decision of the Secretary of State under section 8(1)(a) or (c) of the Social Security Act 1998, the tribunal's jurisdiction was to consider the merits of that decision and, if necessary, correct it, having regard to the powers available to the adjudication officer when he made it;
2.	there is no free-standing need for severe disablement in section 72 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. There has to be a physical or mental disablement which meets the statutory criteria. The severity of the disablement is determined by the care needs which arise and not by reference to the general nature of the disablement;
3.	the tribunal had erred by construing the words ""continual supervision"" in section 72 as equating to ""uninterrupted supervision"". ""Continuous"" meant ""uninterrupted"" whereas the proper meaning of ""continual"" was ""frequently recurring"";

Her claim for jobseekers allowance during the 1997 summer vacation was disallowed on the ground that she was engaged in remunerative work and her appeal was dismissed by a social security appeal tribunal.

It was the claimants contention that he was entitled to an award of the higher rate of the mobility component under section 73(1)(c) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 by virtue of severe behavioural problems for the purposes of section 73(3)(b) of that Act, the criteria for which are set out in regulation 12(6) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991.

The adjudication officer submitted to the tribunal that the claimant fell within regulation 85(4)(j) of the JSA Regulations because he had an outstanding claim for asylum and was not within regulation 147(3) because he had not claimed asylum on arrival. The claimant opted for an oral hearing. The tribunal dismissed the appeal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that he had been given insufficient notice of the hearing. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant had not waived the right to receive the seven days period of notice required by regulation 4(2) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995 No.1801);
2.	applying CJSA/7232/1999 the claimant could not be entitled to JSA under the urgent cases rules in regulation 147 because he had not claimed asylum on arrival and so could not fall within regulation 147(3);
3.	for regulation 85(4)(j) to apply to the claimant, it had to be shown that at the time he claimed asylum, he fell within one or more of subparagraphs (a) to (i) of that paragraph. The claimant's application for asylum dated 28 October 1992 did not contain an application to extend or vary his six months' limited leave. Turkey was a signatory to the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance (""ECSMA""). Following the expiry of the six months limited leave granted on entry the claimant remained without further leave so that he fell within subparagraph (b). Had it been the case that the claimant had applied for a variation of his limited leave during the period of leave, he would have fallen within subparagraph (a) because the exclusion of nationals of ECSMA signatory states from that subparagraph did not apply where the application for variation of leave remained outstanding. Even if the claim for asylum were to be treated as an implied application for variation of limited leave, the claimant would nevertheless fall within subparagraph (b) because by the date of his claim for asylum his limited leave had expired. Thus from the date of his claim for asylum he fell within subparagraph (j);
4.	Decision No.3/80 of the Association Council under the Association Agreement between the EEC and Turkey did not produce a different result.  Although Article 3(1) of that decision provided for persons resident in the territory of one of the member states to enjoy the same benefits under the legislation of any member states as the nationals of that state and although income-based JSA was an unemployment benefit within Article 4 of that decision, residence for the purpose of Article 3(1) had to be authorised and lawful, which the claimant's was not on 13.5.1998. On the expiry of his six months' limited leave he was not authorised to reside in the UK;
5.	there was nothing in ECSMA on which the claimant could rely. Even if JSA had been added to the benefits covered in Annex 1, which it had not, ECSMA created only international obligations not obligations and rights on which an individual could rely directly against a state in which he was lawfully present.
6.	The Commissioner distinguished R(SB)24/84. He considered Yildiz v Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 309 (1 March 2001) [now reported as R(IS)9/01], R(SB)25/85, Surul v Bundesanstalt fur Arbeit (Case C-262/96) [1999] ECR I-2685, Tetik v Land Berlin (Case C-171/95) [1997] ECR I-329, R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Savas (Case C-37/98) [2000] All ER (EC) 627, Shah v Barnet London Borough Council [1983] 2 AC 309, Kaya v London Borough of Haringey and another [2001] EWCA Civ 677 (1 May 2001) and R(FC)1/01.

The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the claimant was not entitled to income-based jobseeker's allowance from 13.5.1998 because he was a person from abroad with an applicable amount of nil.

The absent parent appealed against a maintenance assessment made in 1999 in respect of a child born in 1988.

2. in any event no cause of action, within the meaning of section 9(1) of the 1980 Act, accrues until the maintenance assessment has been made;

A maintenance assessment based on the formula was in force in 1996. The absent parent applied for a departure direction in 1997 and a direction was given.

The departure direction was said to be unaffected because the Secretary of State decided that it was not appropriate to cancel the departure direction and consequently it continued to have effect. The parent with care appealed to a tribunal, which confirmed the decision not to cancel the direction. The parent with care appealed to the Commissioner. On granting leave, the district chairman drew attention to the problems that were arising with appeals that raised departure direction issues following the making of a fresh formula assessment.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. there are two schemes, in respect of formula assessment liability and departure directions, which are inter-related and which may produce separate decisions to which rights of appeal attach;
2. a tribunal has jurisdiction only over the decision which is the subject of the appeal;
3. there will not always be a departure direction decision when a formula assessment decision is made because the Secretary of State is entitled to consider the direction, in the absence of any application from the parties, and to allow the direction to continue as before;

In the absence of a reply, a reduced benefit direction was made under section 46 against her family credit. Reasons she later gave were not accepted. She appealed to a tribunal against the direction. The tribunal confirmed the direction on the basis that the appellant feared violence from the man she was living with but that he was not the father of her child. The mother appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the safeguard in sections 6(2) and 46(3) of the Act requires only that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a risk of harm or undue distress to the parent or a child;
2. that is a relatively easy test to meet if there is evidence suggesting that either the parent or a child is possibly put in some form of danger, the risk of which must be real rather than fanciful;

The applicant appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the increase should be more. The Secretary of State supported the appeal because there was insufficient evidence for the tribunal to arrive at the conclusion which they did, and also because the tribunal had incorrectly applied regulations 25(1) and (2), and 40(5), of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996.

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,,"Invalid care allowance - calculation of number of hours of education - meaning of ""attends a course of education at"" - meaning of ""supervised study""

Prior to September 1997 the claimant received invalid care allowance for her mother. However, in September 1997 the claimant began a degree course and, subsequently, her entitlement to benefit was reviewed and withdrawn on the grounds that she was receiving full-time university education. In such circumstances her entitlement to benefit was prevented by section 70(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. A decision on a recoverable overpayment was also made. The claimant's appeal to the appeal tribunal was dismissed. Following an oral hearing, the Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and remitted the case to a fresh tribunal. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. She argued that, in assessing whether education was ""full-time"" (twenty-one hours or more a week) under Regulation 5(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976, the phrase ""attends a course of education at"" should be construed as requiring the student's physical presence at the premises of the educational establishment concerned. She further submitted that the expression ""supervised study"" in regulation 5(2) did not include private study at home. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and remitted the case for rehearing by a differently constituted tribunal in the light of the guidance given.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	(per Pill LJ) the expression ""attends a course of education at a university"" is to be construed in the sense of being enrolled upon such a course and the expression does not, therefore, bear the locational connotation argued for by the appellant;
2.	hours of study away from the premises of the university are therefore capable of coming within the period during which the student is attending a course of education;
3.	as regards regulation 5(2), the test of what is ""supervised study"" does not depend on the period of time for which the supervisor is present with the student;
4.	the work must, however, be study directed to the course of education and the curriculum of the course involved, in addition there must also be a degree of direction by and answerability to a supervisor (although the absence of an immediate sanction for failure to do a piece of work does not take the work done outside the definition of ""supervised study"");
5.	the propositions for the guidance of tribunals and Commissioners on the construction of Regulation 5 stated by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Bronwyn Wright-Turner v Department for Social Development [2002 NICA 2, now reported as R1/02 (ICA)] were agreed with;
6.	further, it was also agreed that the ascertainment of hours of attendance is question of fact to be determined by the decision maker or tribunal;
7.	(per Chadwick LJ) the phrase ""receiving ... education by attendance at"" which appeared in the original form of Regulation 5 when made in 1976 could not have been intended to mean only the receipt of education by physical attendance at classes, lectures and laboratories: on any ordinary meaning of the phrase it must be taken to include private study which is a necessary adjunct to physical attendance at lectures and laboratory work;
8.	the phrase ""attends a course of education at"" in the new regulation  was not intended to effect a change in meaning: there is no basis for construing the phrase as imposing a requirement of physical attendance at the premises of the educational establishment;
9.	in relation to Regulation 5(2), the words ""whether undertaken on or off the premises"" in sub-paragraph (b) do not imply that the supervised study which is to be included under sub-paragraph (a) is limited to study on the premises;
10.	as to the meaning of ""supervised study"" that question must be answered by reference to the facts of the particular case;
11.	the fact that work is ""set"" - in the sense that it is work which the student is expected or required, by the curriculum or by a supervising member of staff, to do - will (save in exceptional cases) bring it squarely within the concept of ""supervised study"";
12.	the approach of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Bronwyn Wright-Turner v Department for Social Development was broadly correct and should be adopted.

The appeal tribunal had upheld the decision of the Secretary of State that the claimant was not entitled to an award of disability living allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. In the course of submissions to the Commissioner, the claimant raised an objection about the independence of the tribunal having regard to the fact that the medical member of the tribunal also undertook medical reports for the Benefits Agency as an examining medical practitioner (EMP). A Tribunal of Commissioners (W M Walker QC, D J May QC, and J N Wright QC) upheld the appeal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Session (the Lord President (Cullen), Lord Kirkwood and Lord Weir), which allowed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the House of Lords, which upheld the decision of the Court of Session.  
 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	an appeal to the Commissioner was competent on a question of law only. The issue of the proper constitution of an appeal tribunal and whether it had acted in breach of the principles of natural justice were questions of law rather than fact. Accordingly, the Tribunal of Commissioners had had jurisdiction to examine it and the question at the stage of any further appeal to the Court of Session and to the House of Lords was also whether the decision of the appeal tribunal was erroneous in point of law (Lawal v Northern Spirit Ltd [2003] UKHL 35 applied) (paragraphs 4 to 7);	

2.	the common law position in regard to the reasonable apprehension of bias had been greatly simplified since the case was before the Tribunal of Commissioners and the possibility of a conflict between the English and the Scottish tests had been removed by the House of Lords in Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67 (paragraph 3);
	
3.	the rationale for disqualification by reason of apparent bias was to ensure that the basic rules of fairness were adhered to and to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the adjudication system and the administration of justice (paragraph 23); 	

4.	the critical issue was whether a fair-minded and informed observer would conclude, having considered the facts, that there was a real possibility that a doctor would not evaluate medical reports prepared by other doctors objectively and impartially, it being assumed that such an observer would have access to all such facts as are capable of being known by the public and that the observer was neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious and could distinguish between what is relevant and what is irrelevant and give appropriate weight to relevant facts (paragraph 17);
	
5.	a doctor exercising the roles of an EMP and of a medically qualified member of the appeal tribunal is called upon to exercise independent professional judgment drawing upon medical knowledge and experience. The fair-minded observer would conclude that the doctor’s knowledge and experience would cut both ways in identifying not only the strengths but also the weaknesses of the reports of EMPs (R (PD) v West Midlands and North West Mental Health Review Tribunal [2004] EWCA Civ 311 applied) (paragraph 21);	

6.	on the facts of the case, there was no basis for a finding that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias.

The absent parent, Mr M, was a partner in a business (W & M), which for a number of years completed 75% of its work for a company WP & Sons Ltd.. In July 1996 Mr M borrowed £10,000 from WP & Sons Ltd. to pay a debt for which both he and Mrs M were liable. Subsequently, in October 1996, Mr and Mrs M separated. In 1997, Mr M applied for a departure direction in respect of special expenses i.e. sums expended in repaying the loan from WP & Sons Ltd., which he contended was a debt qualifying under regulation 16(1) of the Child Support Departure Direction (etc.) Regulations 1996. Regulation 16(2)(k) excludes from regulation 16(1) sums paid by way of repayment of  a loan obtained by the applicant, other than a loan obtained from the qualifying lender or the applicants current or former employer. The Secretary of State rejected the application on the grounds that the loan had not been made by a qualifying lender or by the applicants current or former employer. Mr M appealed. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that although the term employer in regulation 16(2)(k) could be interpreted to include a person who engaged another as an independent contractor, in this case it was not Mr M who had been employed by WP & Sons Ltd. but the partnership, so that the loan had not been made by Mr Ms employer. Mr M appealed to the Commissioner, before whom he argued, inter alia, that the loan from WP & Sons Ltd. was actually made to the partnership W & M, who then paid it on to him, Mr M, personally. Mr M had then to repay the loan to W & M and, accordingly, the loan was from his direct employer and thus eligible as a special expense. Furthermore, the Commissioner also considered the application of regulation 16(4) to the facts of the case.

Held, allowing the appeal, but giving a decision to the same effect, that:

1.	the word employer in regulation 16(2)(k) of the 1996 regulations bears its normal meaning of a person who employs another under a contract of service and did not cover employment under a contract for services. WP & Sons Ltd. was therefore not Mr Ms employer (paragraph 8);

2.	Mr Ms contention that the loan to him was from W & M, which was his employer, was incorrect because he could not be employed by the partnership in which he was a partner and because, on the facts, the loan was made by WP & Sons Ltd. direct to him (paragraph 11);

3.	regulation 16(4) enables a debt incurred entirely (as well as partly) for the purposes of paying off a debt which would have qualified under regulation 16(1) to qualify, but the exclusion in respect of loans in regulation 16(2)(k) applies just as much to that second debt as to the original debt. The fact that the loan from WP & Sons Ltd. had been used to pay a debt which would have qualified under regulation 16(1) therefore did not assist Mr M (paragraphs 16 to 20).

The Commissioner found the tribunals decision erroneous in point of law, set it aside and gave a decision confirming the Secretary of States refusal to make a departure direction.",1,38,,,

The claimant indicated on her jobseekers agreement form that she was prepared to work for at most 20 hours per week. She was initially awarded benefit, but her claim was subsequently disallowed because she had restricted the number of hours that she was prepared to work. The claimants appeal to the tribunal was dismissed and she appealed to the Commissioner. She challenged the requirement contained in regulation 6 of the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996 that a claimant be available for employment for at least 40 hours per week, on the basis that it was indirectly sexually discriminatory and was thus contrary to both the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and to Council Directive 79/7/EEC. The alleged discrimination arose because the percentage of women with no dependent children who work part-time is substantially larger than the equivalent percentage of men, and that discrimination existed notwithstanding the provisions of regulations 13(3) and (4) of the 1996 regulations which permit claimants to restrict their availability to less than 40 hours per week on account either of their physical or mental condition or of their caring responsibilities.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. the statistics on which the claimant sought to establish the discriminatory effect of regulation 6 related to the working population, but, since jobseekers allowance is available only to those who are not working, or are working for 16 hours or less per week, the working population is not the relevant pool for consideration;
2. the requirement as to availability in regulation 6 is not indirectly discriminatory because it is not one with which a greater proportion of one sex than the other is unable, as distinct from unwilling, to comply (judgment of the European Court of Justice in R v The Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith (Case No. C-167-197) at paragraph 60 applied);
3. in a case of indirect discrimination based on statistical comparison (the demographic method) there is a need to be able to state whether or not any member of the relevant population satisfies the requirement or condition in issue (the judgments of the European Court of Justice in Seymour-Smith  and of Mustill LJ (as he then was) in Jones v CAO [1990] IRLR 533 considered);
4. because regulation 13(4) exempts claimants with caring responsibilities from the availability requirement and regulation 13(3) enables claimants with physical or mental disabilities to restrict their availability in any reasonable way, it was not possible to identify any category of claimant unable to comply with the 40 hour availability requirement, and, in the absence of evidence of the existence of such a category, compliance with regulation 6 must be regarded as a matter of choice for each individual claimant;
5. given that the necessary elements to establish a claim of indirect discrimination on a statistical or demographic basis were therefore lacking , the claim of indirect discrimination failed; 
6. furthermore, the tribunal had not erred in law by failing to consider whether the claimant should be regarded as available for work under regulation 16 as that regulation exempts claimants in prescribed circumstances from the requirement to be available for any employed earners employment, but does not enable claimants to limit their availability to less than 40 hours per week.",1,117,,,

The Secretary of State terminated entitlement to incapacity credits. A tribunal confirmed that decision at a paper hearing on 24 July 2000. A decision notice signed by the chairman and bearing that date, but no date of issue, was sent to the claimant, together with a standard covering notice indicating that the claimant had one month from today to apply for a full statement. A request for a statement was received by the Appeals Service on 28 August 2000. A different chairman decided that the tribunal chairman should not be asked to provide a statement as the time for requesting a statement was not extended, and accordingly no statement was produced. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the period of one month in which to apply for a statement under regulation 53(4) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 commences on the day the decision notice is sent by post to the parties;
2. that period is a clear calendar month, so that it starts on the day after the day on which the decision notice is given or sent to the parties;

The appellant claimed benefit on the basis that he was suffering from prescribed disease D4 (allergic rhinitis due to exposure to a listed agent). Neither of two examining medical practioners reports diagnosed the disease, but the appellant obtained two reports from an expert which were helpful to his case. The appellants appeal was heard by a Medical Appeal Tribunal. The tribunal found that the claimant did suffer from allergic rhinitis, but that his condition was constitutional, rather than occupational, in origin. The tribunal did not consider regulation 4(1) of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985, which provides, where a person has one of certain prescribed diseases (including D4), that that disease shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be due to the nature of his employed earners employment if that employment is in any occupation listed against that disease in Schedule 1 to the regulations. The appellant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. for the appellants claim to succeed it had to be shown (inter alia) that the rhinitis was due to exposure to one or more of the agents listed in the formal prescription of the disease in the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985, Schedule 1 (the prescription of the disease having been amended with effect from 24 March 1996);
2. in his claim form the appellant had indicated occupational exposure to several of the listed agents, and the claim therefore put the operation of the presumption of regulation 4(1) into issue;
3. once it is decided that an appellant has allergic rhinitis the cause or causes must be considered, but a tribunal cannot conduct that enquiry until it knows whether the occupation or occupations undertaken by the appellant are prescribed;
4. in this instance, the tribunal which heard the case had not known whether a decision had been taken as to whether or not the appellants occupation was prescribed within the terms of regulation 4(1), and the tribunal had therefore erred in law by failing to adjourn either for such a decision to be taken or for any decision already taken to be reported to it;
5. the changes in the operation of regulation 4 distinguished this case from R(I) 1/97 which was decided under the old form of PD D4 prior to its redefinition and inclusion in the presumption of regulation 4;
6.	 the occupational/constitutional approach to the cause of rhinitis may not be helpful under the new form of PD D4 because, while it is for the experts to decide questions of fact , if an individual is allergic to some of the listed agents and was in a prescribed occupation, then (subject to the other conditions that apply) he or she has the prescribed disease, even if also allergic to other allergens.

The Commissioner set aside the tribunals decision and gave the decision that the tribunal should have given. This was that the case was adjourned for the Secretary of State to decide whether all or any of the occupations that the appellant undertook during the period relevant to this claim were prescribed occupations for PD D4.

The claimant, who was deaf and dumb from birth, applied for an award of attendance allowance. The principal issue was whether the use of an interpreter comprehending and responding to written documents counted as attention for the purposes of entitlement to attendance allowance. The tribunal held that, while the full-time availability of an interpreter might enhance the claimant's lifestyle, the facilities provided by a local centre for sensory impaired people were adequate for his needs. Any additional assistance could not be regarded as amounting to frequent requirements. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	in section 64(2)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, effect must be given to the words ""in connection with"" a bodily function. In both Secretary of State for Social Security v. Fairey (R(A) 2/98) and Cockburn v. Chief Adjudication Officer, it was recognised by the House of Lords that the requirement that attention be ""in connection with"" a bodily function is satisfied if it is a close and intimate act that either must be carried out in the claimant's presence or is so very closely associated with such an act as to be, in effect, part and parcel of the required close and personal service (para. 24);	
	
2.	it was necessary to determine what assistance was reasonably required with the bodily function of hearing. Evaluating what is reasonably required was a matter of fact and degree (para. 40). Commissioners' decisions CSDLA/832/97, CSDLA/840/97 and CSDLA/867/97 were disapproved in so far as they sought to restrict the interpretation of section 64(2)(a) to attention with bodily functions which is immediately and directly linked to a mental or physical disability (paras. 27-30). Commissioners' decisions CDLA/3433/99 and CDLA/1534/00 cited with approval (para.34);	

3.	the requirement for ""frequent attention"" depended upon the pattern and frequency of the claimant's need for attention across the whole span of the day and not on the total duration of that attention. CDLA/12150/96 cited with approval (para. 36).

In 1994 a Commissioner substituted his own decision for that made by a tribunal in respect of the claimants unemployment benefit appeal. The terms of the decision were that unemployment benefit is payable to the claimant for an inclusive period from 27 December 1989 to 3 February 1990. Subsequently, the claimant did not receive any payment in respect of that decision, and, in 1998, he made various inquiries as to the non-payment. The matter was eventually placed before an adjudication officer who decided that payment could not be made. Before the tribunal, the adjudication officer relied on regulation 38 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. He submitted that the right to payment of unemployment benefit for the relevant period had been extinguished because the sum had not been obtained within the period of 12 months from the date on which the right to it is treated as having arisen. The tribunal, applying regulation 38, dismissed the claimants appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. if the amount of a payment has not been quantified then there is no sum under regulation 38(1), even if a basis for quantifying the payment has been identified;
2. it follows therefore, that, if there is no sum, then the right to payment of it cannot arise and it cannot be extinguished under regulation 38.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. ""a course of study"" for the purposes of regulation 4 of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 means a course of education or training made available to the student by the service provider;

The claimant had been diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, a mild form of autism, as a result of which he had difficulties with social interaction and imagination, but no practical difficulties with communication. His claim for DLA was refused. On appeal it was argued on his behalf that assistance with social skills was attention in connection with bodily functions, although there was some disagreement at the tribunal hearing between the claimant and his mother about the amount of assistance he actually needed, the claimant's account being more optimistic. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, finding that the assistance he needed was not in connection with any bodily function. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, before whom his representative argued that communication was a bodily function or alternatively that the help needed with social interaction was help in connection with the bodily function of speaking. He also argued that the tribunal had given insufficient consideration to the evidence and submissions of the representative and the claimant's mother, in view of the nature of the claimant's condition, and had failed to adopt a procedure that would have enabled them to speak more freely. However, he had not raised this matter at the hearing.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	if a person was in fact able to communicate with other people for themselves without assistance, it was too far removed from the bodily functions (such as hearing and seeing) involved in communicating to say that they satisfied the statutory conditions because they were or might be different from other people in the uses to which they put that ability  (paras. 13-14);

On 16 December 1998 a social security appeal tribunal held that the claimant was not entitled to a funeral payment from the social fund in respect of her late husband who had been buried in Bangladesh. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, challenging on two grounds the validity of the condition contained in regulation 7(1)(b) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 that a payment to meet funeral expenses shall be made only where a funeral takes place in the United Kingdom. First, it was argued that the condition was invalid as outside the proper and rational scope of the regulation-making powers conferred on the Secretary of State. Secondly, it was argued that the effect of the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October 2000 was to invalidate the condition as it infringed Article 14 by placing discriminatory restrictions on the ability of persons affected by it to enjoy the rights and freedoms protected by Articles 8 and 9.


Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. the broad terms of the relevant enabling provisions (sections 138 and 175 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992) entitle the Secretary of State to exercise that power so as to prescribe conditions of entitlement which  have different effects between different people or classes of people;
2. furthermore, given that it is not irrational per se for the Secretary of State to make regulations restricting the funerals for which public assistance is to be granted in the United Kingdom, it cannot be irrational for him to choose to make a rule restricting grants to funerals taking place on United Kingdom soil;
3. the fact that the regulation produces a hard case or an anomaly does not necessarily make it irrational (Mummery LJ in R(IS) 8/99 Owen v Chief Adjudication Officer applied);
4. the Human Rights Act 1998 did not have retrospective effect extending to turning past lawful decisions of courts and tribunals into unlawful ones in United Kingdom law from 2 October 2000 so as to oblige appellate courts to reverse the effect of decisions retrospectively from that date onwards (R  v Lambert [2001] 3 WLR 206, affirming Sir Andrew Morritt V-C in Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No.2) [2001] 3 WLR at 42 and 51, applied);

In each case, compensation was paid to a claimant following an industrial accident. The Secretary of State issued certificates of recoverable benefits under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 and recovered from the compensators benefits paid to the claimants following the accidents. The compensators appealed against the certificates, under section 11(1)(b) of the 1997 Act, contending in each case that benefits listed in the certificates, including industrial injuries benefits, had been ""paid otherwise than in respect of"" the industrial accident. All three appeals were allowed by tribunals. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioners on the ground that the industrial injuries benefits had been expressly awarded on the basis that the claimants had suffered personal injury caused by the industrial accidents and that the benefits had therefore necessarily been paid in respect of the accidents, even if evidence showed that they ought not to have been paid at all.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that:

1.	in the context of the 1997 Act, benefits that had been paid but ought not to have been paid could not be said to have been ""paid...in respect of"" a relevant accident, injury or disease because it had not been the intention of Parliament that a compensator should be obliged to reimburse the Secretary of State for benefits mistakenly paid;

The claimant was in receipt of an award of disability living allowance. She was covertly observed by officials of the Department of Social Security, and videotaped for about two minutes. The claimant's award was then reviewed and brought to an end. On appeal, videotapes and statements by departmental officials setting out their observations were before the tribunal. It upheld the decision to end the award of benefit. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. She argued that both the covert observation and videotaping interfered with the right to respect for her private life pursuant to Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that in admitting the tapes and statements as evidence the tribunal had failed to give her a fair hearing pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Convention.

The claimant had worked, and paid national insurance contributions, in the United Kingdom prior to 1971. In 1996 he claimed and was awarded sickness benefit from the German authorities, who in 1997 referred the claim to the United Kingdom authorities to determine whether the claimant was entitled to, in European Community terms, a sickness or invalidity benefit. The reference included a doctor's report dated 20 January 1997 indicating partial incapacity only. Payment of the German sickness benefit continued until 2 June 1997, but from 1 February 1997 was set off against an award of retirement pension paid at age 60 on account of invalidity. The adjudication officer decided the claimant was not entitled to incapacity benefit for the period 2 February 1996 to 21 January 1997 because he was not entitled to invalidity benefit under German legislation, and he was throughout the period entitled to cash sickness benefit under German legislation. The adjudication officer also decided that the claimant could not be treated as satisfying the all work test from 21 January 1997 as he had not provided evidence of incapacity for work from that date. The claimant appealed to a tribunal. The tribunal discounted the doctor's report and found that the claimant had been entitled to benefit for more than 364 days. Their decision was that the claimant was not disentitled to incapacity benefit from 2 February 1996 to 21 January 1997, and that he had provided sufficient evidence of incapacity for work to be treated as satisfying the all work test from 21 January 1997. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. Germany is in this case the competent state for the purpose of the provisions on sickness benefits in Articles 18 to 36 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71;
2. short-term incapacity benefit payable at the lower rate is clearly a sickness benefit, and long-term incapacity benefit is clearly an invalidity benefit;
3. on balance short-term incapacity benefit payable at the higher rate should also be classified as a sickness benefit, because there is no reference to age of onset of incapacity in section 30B(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and it is replaced by long-term incapacity benefit in cases of terminal illness or particularly severe disability (section 30B(4));
4. the claimant is not entitled to British short-term incapacity benefit for any period from 2 February 1996;
5. Articles 37 to 43 of the Regulation, on invalidity, do not use the concept of competent state and the claimant is entitled to rely on Article 40(3)(a) because entitlement to long-term incapacity benefit is conditional on the receipt of cash benefits for 364 days, and the claimant's entitlement to sickness benefit from the German authorities is to be treated as if it were entitlement to British short-term incapacity benefit;
6. the claimant's award of retirement pension from age 60 on account of invalidity falls within sub-paragraph (i) of Article 40(3)(b), so that there can be no entitlement to incapacity benefit before the date of the retirement pension award.

The claimant was entitled to retirement pension on 10 December 1997, made up of a basic pension, an additional pension from his contributions to the current state pension scheme, and graduated retirement benefit from his earnings-related contributions to the previous scheme. The claimant was serving a sentence of imprisonment at that time, and was released on 8 November 1999. An adjudication officer decided the claimant was disqualified for receiving any pension while undergoing imprisonment, by virtue of the provisions of section 113(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. A tribunal confirmed the disqualification. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. the disqualification was correctly applied under the clear and unambiguous terms of section 113(1) of the Act;
2. the disqualification extended to the claimant's additional pension under SERPS and the graduated retirement benefit under section 62 of the Act, even though they were based on his earnings-related contributions;

The claimant did not satisfy the ""all work"" test, but was entitled to incapacity benefit as suffering ""from some specific disease ... and by reason of such disease ... there would be a substantial risk to [his] mental or physical health...if he was found capable of work"" within the exception provided by regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (the ""1995 Regulations""). In 1996 the conditions in regulation 27 were recast and paragraph (b) was repealed and not re-enacted by the Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous) Regulations 1996 (the ""1996 Regulations""). The claimant did not fall within the exceptions as amended and his entitlement to incapacity benefit was terminated. 
Section 172 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 required the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to refer proposals for certain regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee unless ... (section 173(1)(b)) ""the [Committee] have agreed that they shall not be referred"". Proposed amendments to regulations were referred informally to the Committee for them to decide whether they required a formal reference under section 172 or whether they agreed, under section 173, that the proposals should not be referred. The Committee members were accustomed and expected to rely on the information and assistance of officials of the Department for Work and Pensions as to the detail and intended effects of any proposal put to them. The practice was for each proposed amendment to be described by the departmental officials as ""technical"", ""neutral"", ""adverse"" or ""beneficial"". In 1996 when the proposal amendment of regulation 27 of the 1995 Regulations was submitted it was described as ""neutral"". At a subsequent meeting of the Committee to consider the proposals an official explained, in answer to questions about whether all the amendments were in fact ""neutral"", that all claimants who fell within regulation 27(b) of the 1995 Regulations would be covered by other provisions within the ""all work test"". Those statements were untrue. In reliance on them, the Committee did not require a formal reference of the proposed recasting of regulation 27 and the 1996 Regulations were made.
The claimant challenged the validity of the regulation 27 as amended by the 1996 Regulations contending that he should continue to be given the benefit of regulation 27(b) of the 1995 Regulations as originally enacted. An appeal tribunal rejected his appeal against the termination of his benefit. He appealed to the Commissioner who criticised the conduct of the departmental officials responsible for the misstatements but, in view of the concession that the agreement of the Committee was not procured by deception, concluded that the objective fact of that agreement was sufficient to comply with section 173(1)(b).

The appellant was accepted as incapable of work from the end of 1997 and, in October 1998 (following examination), qualified for incapacity benefit by reason of the exceptional circumstances provisions contained in regulation 27 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995. On further examination in May 1999, the examining doctor took the view that the appellant scored 9 points on the all work test, and that regulation 27 no longer applied. The appellants benefit was reviewed and terminated with effect from 4 June 1999. On appeal to a tribunal, the appellant raised, inter alia, his ability to bend and kneel. The tribunal varied the adjudication officers decision to the extent that it awarded a further 3 points, but the appellants score was still insufficient to qualify him for benefit. The tribunal did not award any points for bending and kneeling because it found that the appellant would be able to kneel, even if, at times, because of his back problems, he could not bend. The appellant appealed to the Commissioner, who in the grant of leave raised the issue of whether the claimant did in fact satisfy descriptor 6(c) in the Schedule to the Regulations. By later direction, the Commissioner also raised the decisions in CIB/16461/1996 and CIB/4904/1998 which interpreted the bending and kneeling descriptors to the effect that a claimant who sometimes could not bend, but could kneel, did satisfy descriptor 6(c). Such  decisions ran contrary to other Commissioners authorities. Following the refusal of an application to appoint a Tribunal of Commissioners, it was directed that the appeal be decided by a Commissioner who had not previously expressed a view on the bending and kneeling descriptors.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The absent parent shared the care of his child with the parent with care, and sought an allowance for shared care. At issue was whether he had care of the child for not less than 104 nights in the year commencing 1st December 1998, and therefore had day to day care pursuant to regulation 1(1) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992.
The absent parent argued that he had had care of his child on 105 nights in the year, 93 of which had been spent with him and the remainder with the childs grandparents or aunt. The Secretary of State decided that the absent parent did not have day to day care. A tribunal rejected his appeal because they did not accept his evidence. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal went wrong in law by not accepting the evidence of the absent parent, which the Commissioner accepted on making his own findings of fact (paragraphs 6-10);
2.	there are different aspects to caring for a child and whether the absent parent had day to day care of his child depended on the meaning given to care in regulation 1(1) (paragraphs 11-18);

5.	 separation is not necessarily incompatible with such care, but that will depend on factors such as length, duration and the continuing exercise of control (paragraph 20);
6.	 applying this analysis to the facts of this case, the absent parent did not have care of his child when she stayed overnight with her grandparents or aunt (paragraphs 21-23).

Review - limitation of payment - whether limit to backdating if entitlement established retrospectively other than in cases of official error

In each of these two cases the claimant was a disabled elderly lady whose principal asset was her house. The local authority social services department had in each case made use of powers under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948 to make ?arrangements for providing residential accommodation for persons in need of care and attention? pending sale of the house so that, by virtue of section 22 of that Act (which makes the assisted person, subject to exemption by a means test, legally liable to reimburse the local authority in full) and so long as the value of the house was adequate, the local authority was in effect providing only bridging finance albeit over a substantial period. There was in fact never any doubt that the local authority would be reimbursed in full and in each case full recoupment in due course took place. 
Regulation 7 of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 provides that, subject to regulation 8, a person shall not be paid any amount in respect of attendance allowance for any period where throughout that period he is a person for whom accommodation is provided in pursuance of Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948 and regulation 8(6), on which the payability issue in these cases turned, provides (so far as applicable) that regulation 7 shall not apply ?for any period during which ?  the whole of the cost of the accommodation is met ... out of his own resources?. 
The two questions which arose in each case were (i) whether regulation 7, subject to regulation 8, prevents attendance allowance being payable where the assistance given under Part III is only by way of bridging finance; and (ii) if not, whether the procedural provisions about review of benefit decisions which limit the right to back payments where entitlement is established retrospectively following a change of circumstances nevertheless had the effect of taking the allowance away for some or all of the bridging period. 

Held, allowing both appeals, that:
1.	as to the payability question, following the decision of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Chief Adjudication Officer v. Creighton and Others (15 December 1999) that in the context of regulation 8(6) the word ?met? refers to the person who ultimately meets the costs, not the person or body who makes the payment when the fees are paid to the provider of the accommodation, and ?during? means ?for the duration of?, so that the cost of the claimants? accommodation for the bridging period was met out of their own resources by virtue of the subsequent repayment;
2.	alternatively the claimants counted during each week of that period as meeting their own costs by virtue of their accruing liability to repay the local authority, so long as the value of their houses remained sufficient for eventual recoupment;
3.	accordingly attendance allowance remained payable for the bridging period;
4.	as to the review question, the true basis for the reinstatement of the allowance was not a ?change of circumstances?, but that the decision applying regulation 7 so as to suspend payment had been in error of law within regulation 57(3) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 so that no restriction on retrospective payment applied;
5.	on the actual facts of each case, the only decision to be corrected had been a decision purporting to suspend payment under the original award of benefit, not a decision to make benefit payable or increase the rate of benefit, so regulation 59 had no application at all.",1,79,253,"DLA, AA, MA: general: accommodation costs

The claimant was born profoundly deaf and unable to speak. He appealed against the disallowance of his claim for disability living allowance made on 2 August 1995. The tribunal allowed his appeal to the extent of finding that, when all his needs for assistance in communicating were aggregated, he satisfied the conditions of entitlement to the middle rate of the care component. The adjudication officer appealed on the ground that the tribunal had made inadequate findings of fact as to the occasions during the day when the claimant required the assistance of a third person with hearing and communication and as to whether such attention was reasonably required.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	if the attention in connection with the bodily function of hearing and communicating was provided for the claimant, it would be likely to lack the personal contact/proximity element referred to by Lord Clyde in Cockburn v. Chief Adjudication Officer and Another [1997] 1 WLR 799 (HL) [R(A) 2/98] but if it is rendered in the claimant?s presence and in such a way as to assist him to carry out the activity himself, it could count as attention (para. 14);

The claimant was profoundly and prelingually deaf. Her claim for disability living allowance made on 30 June 1998, she being then aged 17, was refused by the adjudication officer. The tribunal allowed her appeal to the extent only of holding that she satisfied the conditions for an award of the lower rate of the mobility component. She appealed on the ground that the tribunal had made insufficient findings of fact. Both in the tribunal proceedings and in her appeal to the Commissioner she pointed out that she needed to be tapped on the shoulder or waved at to get her attention. The Secretary of State?s representative supported the appeal on the ground that the tribunal had made inadequate findings on the help that the claimant needed to participate in social activities. However, he argued that attracting a person?s attention would only rarely amount to attention in connection with a bodily function and that this would apply only if the claimant were so handicapped that significant and unusual efforts were needed to attract her attention in order to communicate with her.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	attention in connection with bodily functions includes unusual efforts reasonably required to attract the claimant?s attention in order to communicate with her, being steps not required to attract the attention of a person in the same environment who is not deaf;
2.	the tribunal failed to make findings on this issue and thereby erred in law.

The claimant had two industrial accidents, in 1982 and 1984. On different dates in 1998 he made two claims for reduced earnings allowance (REA). The first claim, made in respect of the first accident, was disallowed, but he was awarded REA on the second claim, made in respect of the second accident, from a date three months before that claim. The claimant?s appeal against the disallowance was dismissed by a tribunal and he appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner held inter alia that there could be only one award of REA and that loss of earnings from all accidents should be taken into account in that one award made on one claim, subject to the maximum of 40% of the maximum rate of a disablement pension as provided in paragraph 11(10) of Schedule 7 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The Commissioner therefore decided that the second claim had been unnecessary and that the claimant was entitled to REA from a date three months before the first claim. The Secretary of State appealed. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there can be multiple claims for and awards of REA where there are successive industrial injuries each of which makes the claimant incapable of following his current regular occupation;
2.	 on each claim the maximum amount of REA payable is 40% of the maximum disablement pension;

The claim was refused on the grounds that it was not reasonable for the claimant to accept responsibility for the funeral expenses ?as there was an immediate family member [the claimant?s fourth sister] who was not estranged from the deceased and was not in receipt of a qualifying benefit?. The tribunal rejected an argument by the claimant that regulation 7(3)(b) of the 1987 Regulations operated to disentitle him to a funeral payment only if none of his sisters had been awarded a qualifying benefit.

The claimant claimed income-based jobseeker?s allowance from 2 November 1998. He declared as capital his interest in his former matrimonial home, which was occupied by his wife, from whom he was separated, and their daughter aged under 18. The property was held on a long lease, but the claimant did not give any details of its terms. He stated that his wife did not wish to leave the property. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant should be treated, in accordance with regulation 115 of the Jobseeker?s Allowance Regulations 1996, as possessing a half share in the property and requested advice from the valuation office regarding its value.

An opinion was provided by a valuer that the open market value of the whole property was £30,000 and the value of the claimant?s interest was £9,200. The valuer's evidence did not indicate what was the length of the lease or what assumptions had been made regarding the claimant?s prospects of enforcing a sale of the property against his wife?s wishes. On the basis of the valuer?s opinion, the adjudication officer decided that the claimant possessed capital in excess of £8,000 and so was not entitled to income based jobseeker?s allowance from 2 November 1998. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal who, on 26 August 1999, confirmed the adjudication officer?s decision, although they found that the claimant was entitled from 25 November 1999 as the capital could be disregarded from that date. The claimant appealed. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it is not a sufficient explanation of a decision for a tribunal to accept the opinion of a valuer as to the value of an interest in property, even where the valuer is shown to be an expert, without some reasons being given for adopting the value put forward (para. 10);
2.	there is no rule of law that, where a wife and children are still living in the former matrimonial home, the value of a claimant?s share in that home must be regarded as nil (para. 11);
3.	the value of the claimant?s share must be considered on the evidence in each case but, where a property is of modest value and none of that value can be realised by the claimant or any person acquiring his interest for a lengthy or unascertainable period, it is unlikely that anybody would be prepared to pay very much for that interest and it may have little or no value (para. 11);
4.	proper valuation evidence should include:
(i)	grounds on which the valuer is held out as having appropriate expert knowledge, including, where the value of a share in property is at issue, the valuer?s experience relating to such shares and their sale;
(ii)	details of the property, including its location, size and condition, sufficient to provide a basis for the valuation;
(iii)	in the case of leasehold property, details of the length of the lease and any special terms in it;
(iv)	where the value of a share in property is in issue, an explanation of the factors considered relevant to the valuation and how they affect it;
(v)	evidence of actual sales of comparable properties or interests, or an explanation of why these are not available,
but where this is not possible and the valuer has had to proceed on the basis of assumptions because of the lack of any relevant information, the report should state what is missing and the assumptions upon which the report is based (paras. 13 and 14);
5.	the valuation evidence in this case was worthless and there was no evidence that the claimant?s capital exceeded £8,000 from 2 November 1998 to 24 August 1999 (paras. 15 and 16).

Compensation was paid to a claimant in respect of pneumoconiosis. The Secretary of State issued a certificate of recoverable benefits under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 and recovered from the compensator benefits paid to the claimant before the claim for compensation was settled. The compensator appealed against the certificate, under section 11(1)(b) of the 1997 Act, contending that the claimant had not been incapable of work and that income support, sickness benefit, invalidity benefit and incapacity benefit listed in the certificate ought not to have been paid and had therefore been ""paid otherwise than in respect of"" the pneumoconiosis. The Secretary of State submitted that the tribunal were not entitled to consider whether benefit had been wrongly awarded. The tribunal accepted the Secretary of State's submission and dismissed the appeal. The compensator appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	income support was recoverable only if the sickness benefit, invalidity benefit or incapacity benefit paid at the same time was recoverable, because the tests of incapacity for work for the purposes of income support were linked to those for the contributory benefits;
2.	sickness and invalidity benefit were not recoverable because, for the reasons given in R(CR) 1/02, benefits that had been paid to the claimant but ought not to have been paid could not be said to have been ""paid...in respect of"" the pneumoconiosis, the claimant's entitlement to sickness and invalidity benefit had depended on him having been actually incapable of work and, on the evidence, the claimant had not in fact been incapable of work;
3.	incapacity benefit was not recoverable because, although the claimant had been awarded incapacity benefit on the basis that he was to be treated as incapable of work while submitting medical certificates pending an assessment for the all work test, his entitlement under regulation 31 of the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) (Transitional) Regulations 1995 to be treated as incapable of work on that basis depended on a determination that he had been incapable of work for the purposes of sickness and invalidity benefit and that determination had been erroneous.

On 12 October 1998, he became incapable of work and was paid statutory sick pay (SSP) until the end of his term of employment. His claim for income support (IS) on 13 October 1998 was disallowed because his SSP exceeded his applicable amount. On 2 November 1998, he claimed both IS and SDA. His SDA claim was refused by the adjudication officer on the ground that he had not been incapable of work and disabled for 196 days. Under section 68(10) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, days of entitlement to disability working allowance were to be treated as having been days of incapacity for work and disablement if inter alia the claimant was entitled to disability working allowance for the week in which there fell the last day on which the claimant was engaged in remunerative work. However, the adjudication officer considered that section 68(10) could not assist the claimant because SDA could not be paid from the date when DWA ended, as the claimant was then entitled to SSP. As a result, IS was awarded without a disability premium. The tribunal allowed the claimant?s appeal and found he was entitled to SDA from 13 October 1998. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner, before whom it was argued that, as long as a contract of service existed and a person was on sick leave, he was to be regarded as still being engaged in remunerative work.

The claimant in CIB/6904/1999 had been in receipt of long-term incapacity benefit (IB) until 1 April 1997. On 2 April 1997 he started work and was awarded DWA. He became incapable of work on 6 May 1998 and was paid SSP until 18 August 1998, when he asked his employer to stop paying him SSP because he believed that this would enable him to claim long-term IB. The adjudication officer awarded only the lower rate of short-term IB, on the ground that the claimant had not been incapable of work for 196 days. Under section 30C(5) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, days of entitlement to disability working allowance were to be treated as having been days of incapacity for work if inter alia the claimant was entitled to disability working allowance for the week in which there fell the last day on which the claimant was engaged in remunerative work. The claimant appealed. The adjudication officer submitted to the tribunal that IB should not have been awarded until 22 November 1998, when entitlement to SSP would have ceased, and that section 30C(5) could not assist the claimant to qualify for long-term IB because it required that the claimant be entitled to DWA when the contract of employment was terminated. The tribunal accepted those submissions and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing both appeals in part, that:
1.	a person who is incapable of work and who is not actually working has ceased to be ""engaged....in remunerative work"", notwithstanding that a contract of employment continues to subsist (paras. 7 to 12);
2.	IB and SDA are not payable during any period when a claimant is entitled to statutory sick pay but days of entitlement to SSP may be taken into account for some purposes when calculating entitlement to IB and SDA so that a claimant may be able to take advantage of section 30C(5) or section 68(10) when entitlement to SSP expires (para. 13);
3.	in CS/4300/1999, the tribunal had erred in awarding SDA from 13 October 1998, because the claimant was still in receipt of SSP, but the claimant was entitled to SDA from 2 November 1998 provided he had been disabled from 13 October 1998 (paras. 14 and 15);
4.	in CIB/6904/1999, the tribunal had correctly held that the claimant was not entitled to IB while entitled to SSP, notwithstanding the fact that he had asked his employer to cease payments, but had erred in not finding that the claimant was entitled to long-term IB from 22 November 1998 (para. 16).

Review - limitation of payment - whether limit to backdating if entitlement established retrospectively other than in cases of official error

In each of these two cases the claimant was a disabled elderly lady whose principal asset was her house. The local authority social services department had in each case made use of powers under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948 to make ""arrangements for providing residential accommodation for persons in need of care and attention"" pending sale of the house so that, by virtue of section 22 of that Act (which makes the assisted person, subject to exemption by a means test, legally liable to reimburse the local authority in full) and so long as the value of the house was adequate, the local authority was in effect providing only bridging finance albeit over a substantial period. There was in fact never any doubt that the local authority would be reimbursed in full and in each case full recoupment in due course took place. 
Regulation 7 of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 provides that, subject to regulation 8, a person shall not be paid any amount in respect of attendance allowance for any period where throughout that period he is a person for whom accommodation is provided in pursuance of Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948 and regulation 8(6), on which the payability issue in these cases turned, provides (so far as applicable) that regulation 7 shall not apply ""for any period during which...the whole of the cost of the accommodation is met ... out of his own resources"". 
The two questions which arose in each case were (i) whether regulation 7, subject to regulation 8, prevents attendance allowance being payable where the assistance given under Part III is only by way of bridging finance; and (ii) if not, whether the procedural provisions about review of benefit decisions which limit the right to back payments where entitlement is established retrospectively following a change of circumstances nevertheless had the effect of taking the allowance away for some or all of the bridging period. 

Held, allowing both appeals, that:
1.	as to the payability question, following the decision of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Chief Adjudication Officer v. Creighton and Others (15 December 1999) that in the context of regulation 8(6) the word ""met"" refers to the person who ultimately meets the costs, not the person or body who makes the payment when the fees are paid to the provider of the accommodation, and ""during"" means ""for the duration of"", so that the cost of the claimants' accommodation for the bridging period was met out of their own resources by virtue of the subsequent repayment;
2.	alternatively the claimants counted during each week of that period as meeting their own costs by virtue of their accruing liability to repay the local authority, so long as the value of their houses remained sufficient for eventual recoupment;
3.	accordingly attendance allowance remained payable for the bridging period;
4.	as to the review question, the true basis for the reinstatement of the allowance was not a ""change of circumstances"", but that the decision applying regulation 7 so as to suspend payment had been in error of law within regulation 57(3) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 so that no restriction on retrospective payment applied;
5.	on the actual facts of each case, the only decision to be corrected had been a decision purporting to suspend payment under the original award of benefit, not a decision to make benefit payable or increase the rate of benefit, so regulation 59 had no application at all.",1,79,253,"DLA, AA, MA: general: accommodation costs

Compensation was paid to the claimant in respect of a head injury, which he claimed caused epilepsy. The Secretary of State issued a certificate of recoverable benefits, listing benefits claimed in respect of epilepsy. The compensator appealed against the certificate of recoverable benefits, arguing that the injury was minor, that the claimant was not suffering from epilepsy and that such symptoms as he had were not caused by, or were not solely caused by, the relevant accident. The Secretary of State argued that the tribunal could not go behind the awards of benefits which were plainly made on the basis that the claimant was suffering from epilepsy and, at least in the case of disablement benefit, that the epilepsy had been caused by the relevant accident. The tribunal dismissed the compensator's appeal. The compensator appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State conceded in the light of R(CR) 1/02 and R(CR) 2/02, that the submission to the tribunal had been flawed but raised the question whether a tribunal was entitled to determine that part only of a benefit was recoverable. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal's decision was erroneous in point of law because they had either accepted the Secretary of State's submission to them or had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting the compensator's arguments on the facts (paragraph 3);
2.	if benefit had been paid at the wrong rate, only that part of the benefit that ought to have been paid was recoverable from the compensator (paragraph 4);
3.	it is open to a compensator to argue that disablement benefit had been paid at the wrong rate because the degree of disablement had been wrongly assessed (paragraph 5).

The claimant had been in receipt of a category A retirement pension for six years based on her own national insurance contributions when her husband reached the age of 65 in 1992.  He then claimed and received a category A pension. At that time the claimant could have claimed a category B pension based on his contributions, which would have been larger than her category A pension and payable in its place. She was not invited to make a claim then and in fact did not do so until March 2000, when the pension was awarded, but only with effect from 2 December 1999. She appealed to an appeal tribunal, arguing that her claim should have been treated as a request for a correction to her existing pension, and that a claim was not necessary. The tribunal decided that it had no power to backdate the award beyond the three months provided for by regulation 19 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (""the 1987 Regulations"") for the making of claims. The Commissioner allowed her appeal against this decision on the basis of the wording of section 43(5) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (""the Benefits Act""), which, in his view, created an express statutory exception to the requirement in section 1 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (""the Administration Act"") that entitlement to social security benefits was dependant upon a claim having been made.

The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:	

1.	the Commissioner was wrong in his conclusion that section 43(5) of the Benefits Act was an express statutory exception to the general rule that entitlement to benefit  is dependant on a claim being made (para. 10);	 

2.	section 43(5) had nothing to do with establishing entitlement to a retirement pension, but simply provided a mechanism for choosing between different pensions to which there was entitlement.  In particular it was intended to apply where a claim for one category of pension could be treated as a claim for the other under regulation 9 of and Schedule 1 to the 1987 Regulations (paras. 22 and 24);	

3.	the legislative history illustrated that section 1 of the Administration Act and its predecessor  were enacted to make clear that entitlement to benefit  is ordinarily dependant on a claim being made for it (para.  25);	

4.	the claimant's circumstances did not fall within  any of the exceptions to section 1 of the Administration Act set out in regulation 3 of the 1987 Regulations and she was not entitled to a Category B retirement pension in respect of any period before 2 December 1999 (paras.18 and 26).",1,51,,,

In response to an inquiry from the Department of Work and Pensions, she indicated that she would not be claiming invalid care allowance because she could not commit herself to caring for 35 hours a week. However, she no longer wished to claim jobseekers' allowance as she was not available for work. An appeal tribunal upheld the Secretary of State's decision to refuse the claim for income support on the basis that the 35 hour rule contained in regulation 4 of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 (the ""ICA Regulations"") should apply in interpreting the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1B to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (the ""IS Regulations""). The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that what amounted to substantial care depended on the nature and duration of the care provided in a particular case.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

The claimant was in receipt of income support for himself and his wife. His applicable amount included a severe disability premium of £79.50 under paragraph 13 of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 because he and his wife were both entitled to attendance allowance and they had no non-dependants living with them. The claimant was admitted to hospital in December 1999. After four weeks he ceased to be entitled to attendance allowance, and the severe disability premium was reduced to £39.75. He then moved from hospital to a residential care home on a temporary basis. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 7 to the 1987 Regulations, his applicable amount was re-assessed by aggregating amounts for himself and his wife calculated as if each of them was a single claimant, but no amount representing a severe disability premium was included on the ground that the claimant normally resided with his wife and was to be taken as being a non-dependant within her household. An appeal tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	paragraph 9 of Schedule 7 to the 1987 Regulations required the tribunal to consider the possibility of the claimant's wife notionally satisfying the conditions for a severe disability premium based upon her own entitlement to attendance allowance (para. 11);
2.	for the purpose of calculating the applicable amount under paragraph 9 of Schedule 7, the claimant and his wife were to be treated as normally living apart so that they were not to be treated as non-dependants of each other (para. 12).

The Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and substituted a decision that the claimant was entitled to income support calculated on the basis that his applicable amount included £39.75 representing a severe disability premium to which his wife would have been entitled had she been claiming as a single claimant.",1,172,,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support between June 1995 and August 1999. For much of that period she received regular sums of money from her mother, either paid to her towards rent and living expenses or paid directly to her landlord for rent. The amounts were paid by way of loan, to be reimbursed when her circumstances improved. During this period she completed four review forms on which she replied ""no"" to the question: ""Does anyone pay money to someone else on your behalf?"". In 1997 and 1999 she gave the local authority information about the loans received to date and they in turn informed the Benefits Agency, but no action was taken by the Benefits Agency on either occasion.  Later in 1999 her entitlement to income support ceased because she moved in with her fiancé. In 2000 the Benefits Agency decided that benefit had been overpaid and was recoverable for two periods: the first starting from the week after receipt of the review form in September 1995 and terminating when the Benefits Agency were notified of the loans in 1997 and the second starting from the week after receipt of the review form in 1998 and terminating when the Benefits Agency were again notified of the loans in 1999. The claimant appealed, arguing that the loans were not income and that, even if they were, any overpayments were not recoverable as they were not caused by the claimant's misrepresentation. The tribunal rejected both arguments, as did the Commissioner.
The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	following Leeves v. Adjudication Officer, ""income"" should be given its ordinary and natural meaning and the fact that a payment is a loan and therefore subject to a repayment obligation does not necessarily give it a different character. It was necessary to look at the nature of the repayment obligation (paras. 31-33);	

2.	the Commissioner was correct to conclude that the loans received by the claimant from her mother were income, as there was no certain and immediate obligation to repay (paras. 33 and 37);	

3.	the Court left open the question of whether an element of recurrence or regularity was essential for a loan to count as income (paras. 35-36);	

4.	the department were entitled to rely on the information in a review form as an up-to-date and accurate statement of a claimant's circumstances, regardless of any information they may have received in the past. The overpayments were caused at least in part by the claimant's misrepresentations on the forms and were therefore recoverable (paras. 44-47).",1,234,,,

In September 2000 the claimant obtained a position with a Metropolitan Council, that appointment having been made under the Council's ""Positive Action Training Scheme"". Trainees under the scheme received a training allowance which was exempt from Income Tax and NI deductions. They did not have employee status and did not accrue employment rights. Funding for the training scheme came solely from the Council's own budget. In January 2001 the claimant claimed working families' tax credit. The Board refused his claim on the grounds that he ""was not in paid work for at least 16 hours a week"". The claimant appealed to a tribunal which allowed the appeal. The Board appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that the claimant was not ""employed"" within the terms of regulation 4(1)(c) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987, having regard to the meaning of ""employed earner"" prescribed in regulation 2(1) thereof. That definition refers to section 2(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the definition of ""employed earner"" in section 2(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 applies to Parts I to V of that Act - however, section 128 of the Act (which covers entitlement to working families' tax credit) appears in Part VII of the Act. Given that the 1987 regulations (as amended) are made either under section 128 or under different legislation, but not under Parts I to V of the 1992 Act, the Board's argument as to the interpretation of the term ""employed"" in regulation 4 therefore failed;

2.	the correct approach is that regulation 4(1)(c) is a provision about timing , which determines when it is that the claimant must be working for or in the expectation of payment for at least 16 hours per week; 

3.	that being so, the word ""employed"" in regulation 4(1)(c) is simply shorthand for the provisions set out in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of regulation 4(1);

4.	the claimant had what appeared to be a contract of employment with the council; and, while he might be employed on different terms from other Council employees, the Council's view (expressed in its fact sheet), as to the nature and consequences of the relationship could not be read by itself as excluding rights conferred by the general law, nor could it define the nature of the relationship;

5.	furthermore, the Board, by agreeing tax concessions, cannot exclude a claimant from entitlement to working families tax credit which in nearly all cases would be worth far more to the claimant.

The Commissioner substituted the tribunal's decision with his own to the effect that the claimant was entitled to working families tax credit in respect of the claim made in January 2001.",1,273,239,,

The claimant was in receipt of housing benefit by way of a rent allowance, and council tax benefit. Her wages increased on 27 March 2000, but she failed to inform the authority. Later she submitted a further claim, which correctly set out the amount of her wages. The applicant continued to receive benefit in the form of rebates at the rate appropriate to her previous lower wages. After a delay of some months, the authority on 9 August 2000 recalculated her entitlement from the date her wages had increased, but due to an error on their part an incorrect (lower) figure for her wages was used. As a result, an additional sum by way of housing and council tax benefit was credited to her rent account on 10 August. On 15 August 2000 she was sent a notice to this effect, showing that the benefits had been calculated using the incorrect figure. After some months the authority realised its mistake and attempted to recover the overpayment. The authority accepted that all the overpayments were caused by an official error, but decided that they were recoverable because the claimant could have been expected to realise that the overpayment was occurring. The tribunal upheld the authority's decision, and the claimant appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law in failing to analyse sufficiently precisely how Regulation 99 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 applied to the facts of the case, and its decision would be set aside and a decision to the following effect substituted;
2.	on the footing, conceded by the authority, that the overpayments made before 10 August 2000 were caused by official error, those overpayments were not recoverable under Regulation 99 because the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to realise at the relevant time that she was being overpaid;
3.	however, the overpayments made after that date were recoverable because the claimant could at the relevant time reasonably have been expected to realise that she was being overpaid. In particular, as regards the lump sum payment credited to her rent account on 10 August 2000, even if the time of receipt of that payment was that date, rather than 17 August (when she actually received a financial benefit by not having to pay the instalment of rent which she had been expecting to pay), the claimant could at the time of receipt of the notice dated 15 August reasonably have been expected to realise that the payment was an overpayment. Under Regulation 99(2) an overpayment caused by official error is recoverable if the recipient could at either the time of receipt of the payment or the time of receipt of ""any notice relating to that payment"" reasonably have been expected to realise that it was an overpayment.",1,133,234,,

During the course of their working lives, both claimants had suffered more than one industrial accident or prescribed disease. Prior to October 1986, compensation for disablements assessed at less than 20% (the then threshold for entitlement to disablement benefit in the form of a pension) was by way of separate lump sum payments for each such disablement; and both claimants had received one or more such ""disablement gratuities"". In each case, there had also been a final assessment of continuing disablement for life. With effect from October 1986, lump sum disablement gratuities were abolished. A system of ""aggregation"" for less serious injury or disease was introduced, whereby, in order to qualify for disablement benefit, the assessment of disablement (which could be aggregated to include separate assessments of different disablements) had to reach the threshold of 14%, at which point entitlement to a disablement pension was triggered. Also enacted were provisions intended to prevent claimants using the new aggregation system to obtain further benefit for disablements in respect of which lump sum gratuities had already been paid. The original departmental understanding of those provisions was that disablement percentages for which a gratuity had been paid on a final assessment were at all times thereafter excluded from aggregation in any calculation of the percentage for a disablement pension on any further assessment made from October 1986 onwards. Such understanding was applied (to the claimants and others) consistently from 1986 onwards. However, there followed thereafter a series of Commissioners' cases in which it was held that past gratuity percentages did in fact fall to be included in later aggregation decisions. The decision in the first such case (CI/522/1993) was given on 24 July 1995. In due course, both claimants applied for earlier decisions refusing or limiting aggregation in their cases to be considered again, and, in both cases, the Secretary of State reopened the aggregation question. Fresh decisions were issued, adding in the previously omitted percentages and making (increased) awards of disablement pension accordingly. In each case, the Secretary of State considered that section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998 (the ""test case rule"") applied and, that being so, the backwards effect of each new decision was fixed at 24 July 1995 (the date of decision in CI/522/1993). In the opinion of the Secretary of State such result was determined by the provisions of subsections (1) and (3) of section 27. Under section 27(1)(b) the decision in CI/522/1993 was to be regarded as the ""relevant determination"" in which the previous practice of the Secretary of State on the aggregation issue had first been held erroneous in law, while the terms of section 27(3) ruled out entitlement to benefit in respect of a period before the date of the relevant determination. Each claimant made a successful appeal to a tribunal against the refusal to make a retrospective award of benefit even further back before 24 July 1995. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner. The two cases were directed to be set down for hearing before a Tribunal of Commissioners under section 16(7) of the 1998 Act as involving questions of law of special difficulty. 

Held, allowing the appeals and confirming that the effect of the Secretary of State's fresh decisions was limited to the period from 24 July 1995, that:
1.	the fresh decisions were governed by the test case rule, since it had been the giving of the decision in CI/522/1993 and later cases to the same effect that had caused them to be applied for and made, and the ground for doing so was that the earlier refusal of aggregation on post-1986 assessments had been shown to be erroneous in law (paragraphs 10 and 33);
2.	the only relevant provision under which those fresh decisions could be given any effect for any period before they were applied for or given was regulation 7(6) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, by which a decision superseding an earlier one under section 10 of the 1998 Act in consequence of a ""relevant determination"" within section 27 is to take effect as from the date of that determination (paragraphs 28 and 29);
3.	for this purpose the earliest ""relevant determination"" was that in CI/522/1993, since that was the first case in which the issue of aggregation on which these cases depended was determined judicially by a Commissioner on appeal (paragraph 35);
4.	consequently each tribunal had misdirected itself in purporting to award benefit or direct aggregation for any period before that decision was given on 24 July 1995 (ibid).

The claimant had been in receipt of incapacity benefit. Following disclosure by her that she provided board and lodging, comprising bed, breakfast and evening meals and changing bed linen, for foreign students during the summer months, her award was reviewed on the basis of a change of circumstances. In particular, the decision maker decided that, in respect of certain dates, the claimant was to be treated as capable of work because she had worked and did not fall into an exempt category for the purposes of regulations 16 and 17 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (the ""regulations""). As a result an overpayment of benefit had been made which was recoverable from the claimant. The claimant's appeal to an appeal tribunal was upheld. The tribunal considered that the services provided by the claimant to the foreign students was not work but came within the scope of domestic tasks carried out by the claimant in her own home. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the provision of meals and the changing of sheets in the context of the provision of accommodation for money could not be considered to be domestic tasks as to do so would be to stretch the meaning of the phrase ""domestic tasks"" into tasks which were intrinsically commercial (CIB/14656/96 disapproved);
2.	the legislation did not seek to quantify the amount of work which was provided. It was the nature, context and purpose of the work which was material;
3.	the references to ""care"" and to ""domestic tasks"" in regulation 16 of the regulations were distinct from each other and should be construed separately.",1,166,,,

The claimant was awarded attendance allowance at the lower rate from and including 21 July 1992. On 27 July 1993 she left Great Britain to go and live with her son in France. On being notified of this, the adjudication officer made a decision that the claimant was not entitled to attendance allowance from and including 28 July 1993 because the conditions in regulation 2(1) of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 (""the 1991 regulations"") were not satisfied. This decision was confirmed on review.

The claimant's son appealed against the review decision. A social security appeal tribunal (by a majority) rejected the appeal on the grounds that the claimant (a) was not ordinarily resident in Great Britain and so regulation 2(1)(a)(i) of the 1991 regulations was not satisfied; (b) was not present in Great Britain and so the provisions of regulation 2(1)(a)(ii) of the 1991 regulations were not satisfied; and (c) could not be treated as though she were present in Great Britain under any of the provisions of regulation 2(2) of the 1991 Regulations. The claimant's son appealed to a Commissioner.

The Commissioner gave an interim decision on 2 September 1996 explaining why the conditions in regulation 2(1) of the 1991 regulations were not met, but found that he could not dispose of the case immediately because he needed to refer a question to the European Court of Justice regarding the interpretation of the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 concerning the right to continue to receive attendance allowance of a person who had left Great Britain to live in another Member State. Whilst the reference was outstanding the claimant died on 11 November 1996 and her son was appointed to continue with her claim. 

The European Court of Justice gave their decision on the reference on 11 June 1998. The Court ruled that, (i) until the date on which the amendments made to Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1247/92 came into force (1 June 1992), attendance allowance was governed by the rule on waiver of residence clauses in Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71; (ii) from the coming into force of those amendments, attendance allowance was governed by the system of co-ordination laid down in Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71; (iii) persons who were already in receipt of attendance allowance or who satisfied the conditions for receiving it before 1 June 1992 could continue to rely on the rule in Article 10; (iv) the situation of persons satisfying the conditions of entitlement to attendance allowance as from 1 June 1992 was governed by Article 10a.

Applying its decision in Snares v. Adjudication Officer (Case C-20/96)(reported as R(DLA) 5/99), the Court found that the inclusion of attendance allowance in Annex IIa to Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 conclusively established that it fell within the scope of Article 10a. That conclusion could not be called into question by the fact that point 11 of Section L of Annex VI to the regulation defines attendance allowance as an invalidity benefit for the purposes of application of Article 10, or that the United Kingdom had made a declaration under Article 5 that attendance allowance falls under Article 4(1), which declaration had not been adapted at the time when the amendments came into force. 

On receipt of the reply to his question, the Commissioner gave the final decision. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal erred in law in failing to consider the possible effect on the claimant's entitlement of European Community legislation (paragraph 6 of the interim decision);
2.	the conditions in regulation 2(1) of the 1991 regulations were not met, in the light of the proper meaning to be given to the phrases ""ordinarily resident"" and ""temporary"" (paragraphs 19 and 11 of the interim decision);
3.	the claimant could not rely on the rule on waiver of residence clauses in Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 because she was not in receipt of attendance allowance and did not satisfy the conditions for receiving it before 1 June 1992. In determining the date from which a person satisfied the conditions for receiving attendance allowance, regard must be had to the rule in section 35(4) of the Social Security Act 1975 that there could be no entitlement to attendance allowance before the date of claim. On the facts, there was no dispute that the date of claim was 21 July 1992 (paragraph 6 of the final decision);
4.	the claimant's situation under European Community law was governed by the system of co-ordination in Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71. That provision only requires the Member State where a person is habitually resident to award attendance allowance ""in the territory of"" that Member State and in accordance with its legislation. Article 10a could therefore not prevent the 1991 Regulations from having effect. (paragraph 5 of the final decision).

The Commissioner substituted his own decision (taking into account the death of the claimant) that she was not entitled to attendance allowance for the period 28 July 1993 to 11 November 1996 (both dates included).",1,119,245,,

Natural justice - whether the withholding of relevant evidence from an appeal tribunal by a child support officer renders the decision of the tribunal erroneous in law

The parent with care (PWC) applied for a maintenance assessment under section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991, giving the address of the absent parent (AP) as the matrimonial home. A maintenance enquiry form (MEF) was sent to the absent parent on 28 July 1993, which the AP did not receive. He was sent a further MEF on 23 December 1993, which he completed and returned. A child support officer (CSO) issued a first maintenance assessment with an effective date of 28 July 1993. A second CSO reviewed that assessment, resulting in a slightly higher maintenance assessment with the same effective date. After the AP provided further information, a third CSO carried out a review of the first maintenance assessment under section 18 of the Child Support Act 1991, changed the amount again, and amended the effective date to 23 December 1993.  

The PWC appealed to a tribunal against the amount of the maintenance assessment and the effective date, arguing that it should have remained at 28 July 1993. The tribunal recorded that the AP lived at the former matrimonial home until 30 July 1993, when he moved to a new address. The tribunal was not satisfied that the AP received the MEF sent to him on 28 July 1993 and refused to amend the effective date. 

The PWC appealed to the Commissioner. During the course of the proceedings before the Commissioner a CSO submitted further information which revealed that the MEF sent on 28 July 1993 was not sent to the former matrimonial home but to the address to which the AP was about to move at that time. Furthermore, on 16 August 1993 the AP had written to the CSA to tell them he had not received the MEF sent to him on 28 July 1993. The Agency had sent a further MEF to him with an undated compliments slip, which he had returned, partially completed, on 31 August 1993, but before further enquires were made to obtain the outstanding information he had returned the MEF sent to him on 23 December 1993, fully completed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	under regulation 30(2)(a) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992, as in force before 18 April 1995, the effective date of a first maintenance assessment is the date on which a MEF is sent to the absent parent (paragraph 6);
2.	for the purpose of regulation 30(2)(a) the presumption in regulation 1(6)(b) that a document shall be deemed to have been sent two days after posting (excluding Sundays and bank holidays) does not apply, by virtue of regulation 30(3) (paragraph 7);
3.	in regulation 30(2)(a) sent has its ordinary meaning and means despatched, and the second presumption in section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, namely that the service is effected at the time at which a letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, does not apply (paragraphs 10 and 11);
4.	evidence that a MEF was not received does not in itself show that it was not sent for the purpose of regulation 30(2)(a) (paragraph 12); 
5. in determining whether a MEF has been sent to the AP, the standard of the test in the first presumption in section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, namely that service is deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre-paying and posting a letter containing the document, should be adopted and applied to the particular circumstances of each case (paragraph 12);
6.	the written request, required by regulation 5(2), that the MEF be completed and returned, is distinct from the MEF, and the failure to enclose such a request  with the MEF sent on 31 August 1993 was not a breach of regulation 5(2) and did not in itself affect the date the MEF was sent for the purpose of regulation 30(2)(a) (paragraph 15); 
7.	the withholding of relevant evidence from an appeal tribunal by a CSO renders the appeal tribunals decision (without any fault on its part) contrary to natural justice (paragraph 8).

The absent parent, a police officer, was paid a housing allowance. The child support officer included the allowance as earnings in calculating the parent's net income. The absent parent appealed on the ground, amongst others, that the allowance was a payment falling within paragraph 1(2)(a) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (payment in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment) and thus not to be so treated. The tribunal, by a majority, rejected that ground of appeal finding that the allowance was a ""perk"" and that as such it would be inequitable to disregard it in calculating income. They allowed the appeal on other grounds. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:-
1. the majority tribunal had failed to make findings of fact as to the nature of the allowance to support their conclusion that the allowance was a perk;
2. following the House of Lord's decision in Smith v. Abbott [1994] 1 All ER 673, in order to fall within paragraph 1(2)(a), the expenditure concerned must be incurred in the performance of duty. It was not enough for the expenses concerned to have been incurred in order to put the employee in the position of being able to perform his duties. The historical reason for the allowance was the need for officers to live in areas and in accommodation of a standard neither of which the officers could afford on their basic salaries in order to be available for duty. The allowance was not paid in respect of any expense incurred by them in using their house in the performance of their duty. Accordingly the allowance was to be treated as earnings within the meaning of paragraph 1(1)(d) of Schedule 1.

Cocks,,"Application for maintenance - validity of authorisation by parent with care of the Secretary of State under section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991 to take action - meaning of benefit being ""paid"" in section 6 of and paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 1 to the Act

Mr. Carter (case CCS/8091/1995), Mr. Cocks (case CCS/5021/1995) and Mr. Harmon (case CCS/2513/1995) were absent parents against whom assessments for child support maintenance were made following applications by the parent with care who was being paid income support and had authorised the Secretary of State to act under section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991. They appealed to child support appeal tribunals on the grounds that at the time of the application the parent with care ought not to have been receiving income support. Mr. Carter and Mr. Cocks argued that this had the result that the maintenance assessment was invalid. Mr. Harmon argued that the income which he alleged the parent with care was receiving should be taken into account in the assessment, but the tribunal rejected this on the grounds that paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 1 to the Act provided that a parent with care who was being paid income support should be treated as having no assessable income. In all three cases the tribunal held that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into the question of whether income support was properly payable to the parent with care. The absent parents appealed to a child support commissioner. Mr. Commissioner Rice decided the cases of Mr. Carter and Mr. Cocks together on 11 October 1996. Mr. Commissioner Angus decided the case of Mr. Harmon on 24 October 1996. 

Both Commissioners held that the reference in section 6 of the Act to income support being paid should be construed as meaning ""lawfully paid"". This had the result that if income support was not being lawfully paid to the parent with care, she could not validly authorise the Secretary of State under section 6 to take action and so the Secretary of State could not validly refer the application to the child support officer under section 11 and the child support officer could not validly make a maintenance assessment. However the question of whether income support was properly payable to the parent with care could only be determined by a social security adjudication officer. Therefore if the absent parent put forward substantial grounds for contending that income support was not properly payable to the parent with care, the child support officer should defer making an assessment or a child support appeal tribunal should adjourn consideration of the assessment and ask the adjudication officer to enquire into the matter. If the adjudication officer should subsequently find that income support was not properly payable  to the parent with care, the child support officer should decline to make an assessment or the child support appeal tribunal should direct that the assessment be cancelled. The Secretary of State appealed against the Commissioner's decision in all three cases to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the primary meaning of the word ""paid"" is ""actually paid"". However the statutory context may often have the result that the correct meaning is ""lawfully paid"". But here the statutory context demonstrates that the word ""paid"" in both section 6 of and paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 1 to the Act means ""actually paid"";
2. therefore the question of whether a parent with care is entitled to authorise the Secretary of State under section 6 to take action depends on whether or not one of the specified benefits is claimed by or in respect of her. It does not depend on whether the benefit in question is benefit to which she is entitled. So there is no need for the assessment or collection of child support maintenance to be delayed for this issue to be investigated.
The Court ordered that the decision of the Commissioners be set aside and the decisions of the tribunals reinstated.",1,31,,,

The parent with care and the absent parent entered a Minute of Agreement to regulate inter alia custody of, access to and aliment for their child. The Minute of Agreement was registered in the Books of Council and Session for preservation and execution and an extract copy thereof obtained. The question arose as to the status in Scots law of an extract copy and whether it constituted the equivalent of a court order for the purposes of section 10 of the Child Support Act 1991 and regulation 3 of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992. The Commissioner considered the historical background and the development of this procedure.

Held, allowing the appeal, that 

2. an order required to be made under one of the enactments listed in regulation 3(1) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992 and it was evident that the Court of Session Act 1868 was included in that list since that Act secured that Court of Session decrees, including extracts which contain a warrant for execution, were within power and jurisdiction (paragraph 17).",1,43,,,

Henderson,,"Maintenance assessment - qualifying transfer - meaning of ""property"" - whether an allowance should be made for the transfer of a part beneficial interest in property

The absent parent claimed an allowance under Schedule 3A of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 for the transfer of part of his interest in the former matrimonial home pursuant to a divorce court order made before 5 April 1993. The property had been in the joint beneficial ownership of the two spouses so that their interests before the court order were of equal value. The order, made by consent, provided for the outright transfer of a further 20% of the beneficial interest to the parent with care, increasing her interest to 70% of the value. A further 10% was initially transferred to her but recoupable by the absent parent if he continued to pay the mortgage instalments on the property, and the remaining 20% was retained by him. It was common ground that the transfers to the parent with care were not made expressly for the purpose only of compensating her for maintenance rights in respect of herself. The question arose whether the transfer of a part beneficial interest met the condition in Schedule 3A paragraph 1(1)(d), that the effect of a ""qualifying transfer"" must be that the parent with care is beneficially entitled to the whole of the asset transferred.

The tribunal accepted the contention of the child support officer that the allowance was not applicable to a transfer of a part beneficial interest, as the condition required the whole beneficial interest in the property itself to be made over by the transfer. The Commissioner reversed this, holding that a part beneficial interest in real property or its proceeds of sale was an asset transferable in its own right and that there was a qualifying transfer of the 20% share transferred outright to the parent with care: the further 10% did not meet the condition as she did not become entitled to it absolutely. The ""qualifying value"" under the formula in Schedule 3A was accordingly half the value of 20% of the net equity subject to a due proportion of the mortgage debt on the property. The Secretary of State, who had intervened in the proceedings, appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that condition (d) could only be met where the entire beneficial interest in the property became vested in the parent with care by virtue of the transfer.

Held, dismissing the appeal and confirming the qualifying transfer of 20%, that:
1.	""asset"" in condition (d) includes an undivided share or interest in land;
2.	the condition requires only that the parent with care becomes entitled to the whole of the asset transferred, not some larger asset of which it forms part;
3.	the parent with care was ""entitled to the whole"" of the 20% share transferred to her outright, but not the further 10% where the transfer was only conditional.",1,45,,,

The parent with care (PWC) made an application under section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991 which resulted in an interim maintenance assessment. That was cancelled when a maintenance assessment was made. The PWC appealed against the cancellation and against the basis of the assessment to a tribunal, which found inter alia that a court order had been made on 15 June 1993 but that it had no bearing on the effective date of the assessment. On application by the PWC, the Commissioner granted leave to appeal to consider the effect of the court order and contemporaneous undertakings, and specifically whether there was in force a maintenance order within the meaning of section 8(11) of the Child Support Act 1991 so that an application under section 4 of the Act was precluded by paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Child Support Act 1991 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1992. Section 8(11) defines a maintenance order as an order which requires the making or securing of periodical payments to or for the benefit of the child and is made under specified legislation. 
In the preamble to the court order of 15 June 1993 it was recited that the absent parent undertook to continue to pay periodical payments of £10 per week to each child of the family.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	undertakings may for some purposes be treated in the same way as orders, especially where the undertaking is an integral part of the order, although there are important differences in their nature (e.g. the requirement to carry out an undertaking stems from the undertaking, not the order)  (paragraphs 8 to 19);
2.	section 8(11) of the Act, however, reflects the distinction between undertakings and orders so as to exclude obligations arising out of undertakings, even where the undertaking is an integral part of the order;
3.	the tribunal did not therefore err in law by failing to find that no valid application for maintenance had been made by reason of the existence of the court order.

On 5 June 1995, the child support officer (CSO) decided that the absent parent (AP) who was receiving income support was liable to make a contribution to child maintenance with effect from 13 June 1995. A sum amounting to 5% of his personal allowance was deducted from his income support (section 43 of the Child Support Act 1991 and regulation 28 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 ""the MASC Regulations""). One of the conditions in regulation 28 for imposing liability is that the AP was not receiving any benefit mentioned in Schedule 4. The AP sought a review and then appealed the CSO's refusal to review. He argued that the CSO's failure to ask if he was receiving any payments listed in Schedule 4 to the MASC Regulations rendered the decision void notwithstanding that he was not actually in receipt of any such payments. The child support appeal tribunal dismissed the AP's appeal. The AP appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal but substituted his own decision directing the CSO that the decision made on 5 June 1995 was not to be revised. Leave to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal. The AP submitted that: 1. a liability to deductions did not arise unless and until the CSO made the relevant determination ""in accordance with the provisions of the Act""; 2. the determination of 5 June 1995 was not so made and therefore could not create the relevant liability; 3. if a purported determination was flawed, as this one was, it must be reviewed and replaced; 4. the replacement decision could not have retrospective effect. The AP claimed that paragraph 7A of Schedule 5 to the MASC Regulations confirmed his arguments because it provided that the effective date of the ""revised"" decision was the date that it was made.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	a procedurally flawed decision was not necessarily defective or void. It was implicit in paragraph 7A that, on review, the relevant decision need not be revised and, if it were not revised, would continue to have effect from when it was made. The absence of an express power or specific provision in Schedule 5 for upholding on review a decision that was reached unlawfully did not mean that no such option was available to the CSO;
2.	as the flawed decision was not void, it could be upheld or set aside depending on the view taken by the reviewing authority as to the appropriate course;
3.	the scheme of the legislation was such that the deductions were not to be regarded under section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991 as adversely affecting the children's welfare nor was it unjust not to relieve the AP of the liability to make the payments merely because he had not been asked certain questions which, if he had answered, would not have ""advantaged him one iota"".",1,43,,,

At some date, still in dispute before the Commissioner, the absent parent had started living in the same household (i.e. the parent with care's) as the child in respect of whom a child support maintenance assessment was in force.  The central issue in the case was whether paragraph 16(1)(b) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support Act 1991 operated in those circumstances to terminate the maintenance assessment or whether it was necessary for paragraph 16(1)(d) to be satisfied.  Paragraph 16 provides, in part, that a maintenance assessment shall cease to have effect - ""...(b) on there no longer being any qualifying child with respect to whom it would have effect; (c)...; (d) where the absent parent and the person with care with respect to whom it was made have been living together for a continuous period of six months"".  The child support appeal tribunal held that paragraph (d) had to be satisfied before the assessment terminated.  The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner.
Under section 55 of the Act a person is a ""child"" if under the age of 16 or under the age of 19 and receiving full-time non-advanced education, or under the age of 18 in prescribed circumstances; under section 3(1)(a) a child is a ""qualifying child"" if one of his parents is, in relation to him, an absent parent; under section 3(2) a parent of a child is an ""absent parent"" in relation to that child if (a) that parent is not living in the same household as the child, and (b) the child has his home with a person who is, in relation to him, a person with care; and under section 3(3) a ""person with care"" is a person with whom the child has his home and who usually provides day to day care for the child.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
applying these definitions to the case where a parent who had moved out returns to be a member of the other parent's household and that household includes the qualifying child, that child will immediately no longer have an absent parent and will cease to be a qualifying child and any maintenance assessment which was in force against the former absent parent ceases to have effect immediately under paragraph 16(1)(b) without the need for the parents to have been living together for a continuous period of six months so as to satisfy paragraph 16(1)(d).

The parent with care of a child made a maintenance application in 1996 against the absent parent, who was a married man who had been previously married and had children by the first marriage. In making the maintenance assessment, the question arose as to whether any deduction should be made in the calculation of the absent parents protected or disposable income under the provisions of regulations 11-12 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 in respect of his liability to maintain the children of his first marriage.
That liability arose under two provisions in a court order made in 1987 by consent in divorce proceedings brought by the absent parents first wife. The operative part of the order required the absent parent to make periodical payments of specified amounts to each of the children. The terms of the order also included an undertaking to the court by the absent parent to be responsible for the school bills .. for each of the three children. The two provisions had been negotiated and approved by the court in conjunction with one another, and the order for periodical payments would have been much higher if the undertaking had not been given.

The child support officer decided that the specified sums for periodical payments should be deducted in the calculation of disposable income but not the payments for school fees which the absent parent was still making, on the grounds that payments in accordance with an undertaking did not constitute maintenance under a maintenance order as specified in regulation 11(2)(a)(ii) of the Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases Regulations. The absent parent appealed to a child support appeal tribunal. The tribunal (by a majority) confirmed the decision of the child support officer regarding the payments for school fees. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner on this issue.

The parent with care (PWC) was in receipt of income support and applied for a maintenance assessment under section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991.  The absent parent (AP) failed to return the maintenance enquiry form (MEF) when the CSA refused to give an assurance that his and his second wife's financial details would not be disclosed to the PWC.  After protracted correspondence, the child support officer issued an interim maintenance assessment of £43.92 per week from 21 February 1995.  On a review, the assessment was increased to £56.28 from the same effective date.  The AP applied unsuccessfully for a review of that second decision and appealed to a tribunal who dismissed the appeal.  He appealed to a Commissioner, arguing that there was no legal authority for the inclusion in the formula of a sum in respect of the PWC, that the Agency had discriminated against him in requiring him to provide information about his family's financial position but not requiring the PWC to provide him with similar information, that the Agency was not entitled to request details of his partner's income before an assessment had been made and that the dispute about matters justified his refusal to return the MEF so that there was no ""unavoidable delay"" by him within regulation 8(6) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992.  The Commissioner rejected those arguments and dismissed the appeal.  The AP appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:-
1.	depending on the context in which it was used, the term ""maintenance assessment"" in the Act might refer to a completed assessment which had been notified to the parties or to a different part or stage of the assessment but in the context of paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 1 it meant the calculation up to the point at which the protected earnings level came into play and, accordingly, the child support officer was entitled to ask for information about the AP's new family before there had been a completed maintenance assessment (although it was open to an AP to return a MEF without answering questions about his new partner in which case he would be required to pay an amount calculated without any adjustment to take account of his protected income) (paragraphs 11 to 36);
2.	the AP was not justified in withholding information about himself on the basis that the child support officer would be in breach of section 50(1) of the Act by disclosing his housing costs and details of his second wife's income to the PWC because the PWC had a direct interest in the method of calculation of the maintenance assessment as well as the outcome and the rules of natural justice required that the information needed to explain the end product was communicated to both parties (paragraphs 37 to 45);
3.	the AP could have provided the required information about himself and had chosen not to do so and, accordingly, the delay in returning the MEF had not been ""unavoidable"" (paragraph 46);
4.	there was no presumption arising from the decisions of the benefit authorities awarding income support that prevented the AP from challenging the finding that the PWC ""has no partner"" or had other undisclosed income (the case being distinguishable from Secretary of State for Social Security v.

The absent parent was a fireman who had sustained an injury at work which caused him a permanent disability, leading to his early retirement. He received an occupational pension, comprising an ill health pension because he was forced to retire on the grounds of disablement and an additional injury pension payable because his disablement arose through an injury sustained at work which was not his fault. The whole of his pension was included as income in the maintenance assessment. The absent parent applied for a review of that decision which was refused and he appealed to a child support appeal tribunal, contending that the injury pension, being compensation for personal injury, should be disregarded under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992. The tribunal rejected that contention and the absent parent appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner refused the appeal, deciding that paragraph 5, Schedule 2 does not apply because the injury pension was in the nature of a pension rather than compensation and accordingly was to be taken into account as income by virtue of paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations.

Hogg can be applied to income from rented property

The parent with care of the qualifying child appealed to a child support appeal tribunal against the amount of child support maintenance which the child support officer, in a decision of 13 June 1997, had found the absent parent was liable to pay with effect from 27 February 1997. The tribunal allowed the appeal and gave directions to the child support officer for reassessment. The parent with care appealed to the Commissioner. 

Some of the issues raised on the appeal concerned payments which the absent parent, who was in employed earners employment but not a member of an occupational pension scheme, was making to provide for his retirement under both a retirement annuity contract and a personal pension policy. During the course of 1996, in addition to the regular payments due, he made additional lump sum payments into both schemes. The tribunal held that all these payments were to be taken into account in the calculation of the absent parents net income as allowable deductions from earnings. The parent with care contended that (a) the payments under the retirement annuity contract should not have been allowed as a deduction; and (b) the tribunal should have considered whether, in making the additional lump sum payments under both schemes, the absent parent had deprived himself of capital which would otherwise be a source of income.  
Another issue concerned house property owned by the absent parent from which he obtained a rental income. The tribunal held that, in taking this into account in the calculation of his net income, deductions should be made in respect of the cost of water rates, buildings insurance premiums and maintenance expenses relating to the property. The parent with care contended that only the water rates were properly allowable as a deduction.  

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	contributions under a retirement annuity scheme can be deducted from the earnings of an employed earner under paragraph 1(3)(c) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (the MASC Regulations). The definition of personal pension scheme in Regulation 1(2) of the MASC Regulations adopts, in relation to employed earners, the definition in section 1 of the Pensions Schemes Act 1993, i.e. a scheme which provides benefits in the form of pensions or otherwise payable on death or retirement. An annuity payable under a retirement annuity contract constitutes a pension for the purpose of this definition (para. 13); 
2.	the tribunal erred in law in failing to consider whether the lump sum pension contributions additional to those required under the terms of the schemes constituted a deprivation of capital for the purpose of paragraph 27 of Schedule 1 to the MASC Regulations.  The use of capital on a form of expenditure which is allowable as a deduction in the calculation of net income may constitute a deprivation of capital (para. 18);
3.	in considering whether income from capital should be taken into account under paragraph 27 of Schedule 1 to the MASC Regulations, the intention which has to shown is one to reduce income which might be relevant to a child support assessment which is being made or is reasonably expected to be made. In the interpretation of the phrase with a view to reducing the amount it might be relevant that cases on the phrase with a view of in the now repealed section 44 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 have held that that  phrase required it to be established what the persons dominant intention was (para. 19);
4.	the only items deductible from rental income in the calculation of a parents net income are those specified in paragraph 23 of Schedule 2 to the MASC Regulations. In calculating income (such as rental income) which falls to be taken into account under paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to the MASC Regulations, it is not possible to apply any principle analogous to that applied in the context of a different provision by the Court of Appeal in CAO v. Hogg  [1985] 1 WLR 1100 i.e. that any expenditure necessarily incurred in the obtaining of an income can be deducted in calculating the amount to be taken into account. The use in paragraph 15 of the phrase payments or other amounts received indicates that it is the gross receipts that are to be taken into account, subject to any disregard provided for in Schedule 2. The suggestion to the contrary in decision CCS/5310/1995 disapproved (para.  23).

The absent parent applied for a departure direction under three heads, the third of which was in respect of a property or capital transfer, namely the transfer to the parent with care of his share in the former matrimonial home. That transfer had been made pursuant to the second of three court orders, the order being a consent order. The Secretary of State, on reconsideration, accepted the application under this head. The parent with care appealed to a child support appeal tribunal and the tribunal allowed her appeal and held that the absent parent had not satisfied the conditions for the making of a departure direction. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that: 
1.	the definition in paragraph 3(1)(b) of Schedule 4B to the Child Support Act 1991 precluded construing ""maintenance"" to extend to the provision of a home as a stable base for the absent parent's children's development and schooling;
2.	in a case involving a court order the following will be admissible as evidence, and relevant as considerations in determining whether an absent parent's maintenance for his children was less than would have otherwise have been the case as a consequence of a transfer of capital or property: (i) the terms of the court order; (ii) any contemporaneous documents relating to the making of the order (which will include correspondence between the parties and their legal advisers, documents filed in court or made by a party's advisers for their own use, and the terms of any judgment that was given to explain why the order was made); (iii) the legal context in which the order was made, including the range of orders that may be made and the factors to which a judge must have regard; and (iv) the oral evidence of the parties to the tribunal or to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the award of the care component should have been made from the date when it could first have been said with reasonable certainty that the claimants death could be reasonably anticipated and should have been made until her death (paragraphs 10 and 11);

After the claimant was seriously injured in a road traffic accident he moved to Spain where he received incapacity benefit.  His claim for disability living allowance from 6 April 1992 was disallowed on the ground that he failed the residence and presence requirements. The Commissioner held that, on the facts, the claimant was not ordinarily resident in Great Britain as required by regulation 2(1)(a)(i) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991.  He also held, following R(A) 2/94, that Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, which provided that benefits ""acquired under the legislation of one or more Member States shall not be subject to any reduction, modification, suspension withdrawal or confiscation by reason of the fact that the recipient resides in the territory of a Member State other than that in which the institution responsible for payment is situated"" did not assist the claimant because he had never acquired entitlement to disability living allowance in Great Britain. The claimant appealed, arguing that Article 10(1) disapplied the residence condition on disability living allowance claimed after he had ceased to reside in Great Britain. The Secretary of State responded that since the benefit was non-contributory the claimant had never acquired a right to it and, therefore, the residence condition applied.  

Held, dismissing the appeal, that: 
1.	the fact that a scheme was non-contributory was irrelevant;
2.	Daalmeijer v. Bestuur van de Sociale Verzekeringsbank [1991] ECR I-555 clearly held that Article 10 (1) had no effect on the acquisition of the right to a benefit (except in cases of the kind mentioned below), with the result that any residence conditions were not disapplied;
3.	the position might have been different if there had been a pre-existing or established benefit that had been added to or supplemented in some way, but that was not the case here: Bestuur der Sociale Verzekeringsbank v.

The claimant claimed disability living allowance on 29 January 1996.  The claim was disallowed and the disallowance was not revised on review.  The claimant appealed.  At the request of a tribunal, a report was prepared in December 1996 by an examining medical practitioner.  On 13 March 1997, the claimants appeal was dismissed by the disability appeal tribunal who accepted the evidence of the examining medical practitioner, stating that he was an independent examiner.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that the examining medical practitioner was not independent as he was paid by the Department of Social Security, trained by the Department and open to be influenced by the gloss put upon the law by the Department.  It was further argued that the tribunal failed to address the claimants evidence of deterioration in the three months since the report.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no indication in the findings or reasons that the tribunal had addressed the evidence of deterioration given by the claimant, and as they had not indicated whether or not it was accepted and whether, if accepted, it was considered to be immaterial to their decision, their decision must be set aside (paragraph 6);  
2.	neither CDLA/692/1994 nor CM/361/1992 nor paragraph 7 of CDLA/148/1994 could be considered authority for the proposition that evidence from an examining medical practitioner must of necessity prevail over that led by the claimant (paragraph 11);
3.	such evidence might prevail in the majority of cases once the tribunal had carried out the weighing exercise that they were required to carry out but that did not mean that as a matter of course the examining medical practitioners evidence must prevail because it would fly in the face of the obligation of a tribunal to consider the whole evidence in a case if they accepted one body of evidence on the basis that it must normally prevail over other evidence in the case (paragraph 11);
4.	in this case, the tribunal had not failed to weigh up the evidence as they were required to do because the examining medical practitioner had in effect indicated why there was a conflict between his assessment and the claimants, the tribunal were right to accept that he was an independent examiner and, in those circumstances, they were not required to give any further explanation for accepting his evidence (paragraph 12).

The Commissioner had referred questions to the European Court of Justice on whether disability living allowance was still payable after the claimant had moved permanently to another European Union Member State.  [See R(DLA) 5/99].  
The claimant applied for interim payments pending the reference.
The Commissioner held, refusing the application, that he did not have power to order the making of interim payments of benefit and that he did not have to decide whether he had the power to make an interim or provisional award of benefit.  As a matter of discretion he would not have made an interim award.  Applying Factortame (No. 2) an important factor was that the claimant's case on the referred issue was ""arguable"" rather than ""strongly arguable.""  This plus the fact that a significant number of other disability living allowance claimants would probably also be entitled to interim relief, outweighed the potential harm to the claimant of being denied an award pending the European Court of Justice's decision.

The claimant applied for the decision to be judicially reviewed.

Held, refusing the application for judicial review, that:
1.	the question of the jurisdiction to make an interim award of benefit would be appropriate to refer to the European Court of Justice, but timing would render this fruitless for the application in hand;

Held, that:
1. from 1 June 1992 disability living allowance falls exclusively within Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 as a special non-contributory benefit, so that a person who became entitled to disability living allowance on or after that date could not rely on the principle of the waiver of residence clauses under Art. 10.

A disability appeal tribunal decided that the claimant was not ""severely mentally impaired"" within the meaning of section 73(3)(a) of that Act, as defined by regulation 12(5) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 by virtue of which a person fell within section 73(3) ""....if he suffers from a state of arrested development or incomplete physical development of the brain which results in severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning.""

2. in deciding that the claimant must demonstrate that he had an IQ of 55 or less in order to meet the first of these conditions (""severe impairment of intelligence""), the Commissioner had taken too narrow a view because intelligence includes not merely the functions of understanding and intellect but also the qualities of insight and sagacity and IQ tests are therefore not a true indication of useful intelligence;
3. whilst in every case the claimant's IQ as conventionally tested is likely to be the essential starting point for considering the impairment of intelligence and whilst it is reasonable to take an IQ of 55 or less as the prima facie touchstone of severe impairment, that test and that score will not invariably prove decisive and other evidence must be admitted and considered.

The claimant, a child whose disability was described as being chronic asthmatic - bed wetter claimed the care component of disability living allowance. A disability appeal tribunal decided that he did not qualify for either the day time or the night time conditions in section 72(1)(b)(i) and section 72(1)(c)(ii) respectively. In particular, it was accepted by the tribunal that enuresis was a disablement to which section 72 applied but that the level of attention required was neither repeated nor prolonged. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner who upheld the appeal, substituting his own decision to the same effect. The Commissioner held that inter alia the tribunal had not determined whether enuresis was a mental or physical disablement and that was an error. However the Commissioner also considered further if for the sake of argument it was accepted that the claimant had a disablement they had erred in failing to identify any impaired bodily function and, by inference, in accepting that attention could be given in connection with the bodily function of urinating. The claimant appealed to the Court of Session.

Held, allowing the appeal, that upon the assumption that the requirements for disablement were met:
1. the Commissioner was wrong as a matter of law to exclude attention provided following completion of the bodily function of urinating merely because the attention did not assist in the actual bodily function of urinating. The attention did not have to be in the performance of the bodily function. The Court agreed with the observations of Lords Goff, Mustill, Slynn and Clyde in Cockburn v. Chief Adjudication Officer [1997] 1 WLR 799 [R(A) 2/98];
2. whether attention following completion of the bodily function of urinating will qualify for an award of care component is a matter for consideration in the circumstances of each case under reference to the statutory requirements as a whole.
The Court stated that the appeal before them was not concerned with what was required by disablement to meet the statutory conditions.

On 7 October 1996, section 146A of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 came into force to provide that persons subject to immigration control would not be entitled to child benefit unless they satisfied prescribed conditions.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no error of law in the tribunal not dealing with the claimants point on disclosure as he had not put evidence to that effect before the tribunal (paragraph 5);

The claimant and her husband went through a formal ceremony of marriage at a Sikh Temple in West London on 27 June 1956. There had been no other marriage ceremony and there was no marriage certificate. The claimant and her husband thereafter lived together in a monogamous relationship bringing up their children, until the husband's death in 1994. The Temple was registered for marriages in 1983. The claimant's claim for widow's benefit was refused on the ground that she had not been validly married as the Temple had not been registered at the time of her marriage. The tribunal upheld that decision. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner who held that, as there had been a bona fide ceremony of marriage followed by a long monogamous cohabitation, marriage should be presumed.  The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. there was no statutory provision in the Marriage Act 1949 or elsewhere expressly rendering void a marriage in an unregistered building and it would be wrong not to extend to the parties to an irregular ceremony followed by long cohabitation the benefit of a presumption which would have applied if there had been no evidence of any ceremony at all;
2. R(G) 2/70 was distinguishable on its facts but (per Evans LJ) in so far as it decided that a marriage was void by reason of non-compliance with the relevant statutory requirements, even in the absence of express statutory provision to that effect, then it was not correct.",1,219,,,

(Note: The headnote to this decision has been corrected after consultation with the Commissioner (March 2004). As originally published, the first sentence in holding 1 read there was an error of law . )

The claimant, who lived in Bangladesh, claimed widow's benefit on 2 October 1991 as the widow of Mosabir Ali who had died on 13 May 1991 and whom she had married on 27 May 1975. He had been in receipt of retirement pension since 1975. The claimant's marriage certificate showed her status at the time of the marriage as a divorcee and the Benefits Agency asked for details of her previous marriage and her divorce. Her representatives submitted that she had been divorced  by verbal talaq under Islamic law on 1 May 1973 and produced an affidavit from her father who witnessed the divorce. An adjudication officer refused the claim for widow's benefit on the ground that it had not been established and could not be presumed that there was a valid marriage between the claimant and Mosabir Ali.
The claimant appealed to a tribunal. The appeal tribunal adjourned the hearing to enable the claimant's representatives to seek expert opinions on the validity in Bangladesh of the talaq, following which notice had not been given to the Chairman of the Union Council under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. The representatives obtained an expert opinion which concluded that although the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 was in effect in Bangladesh from 1971, non-service of a talaq on the Chairman of the Union Council did not invalidate the talaq. The opinion referred to case law which had left it uncertain whether from 1972 to 1982 there was a ""hiatus"" in the law, in that no-one was invested with the powers of the Union Chairman under section 7 of the Ordinance. The statement of Pakistani law in R(G) 2/71 was said to be out of date and no longer correct. The adjudication officer produced CG/17/1992 which contained as a schedule an expert opinion in relation to talaq pronounced in East Pakistan (which later became Bangladesh) on 6 January 1971. It concluded that a failure to notify the Chairman of the Union Council under section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 made the talaq ineffective.

At the full tribunal hearing evidence was given by the Chief Imam of the Whitechapel Mosque, who was also a member of the Islamic Shariah Council. His evidence was that after partition in 1971 no law was followed in Bangladesh for some years and nobody would have been able to inform a Chairman of a divorce in that period. The tribunal allowed the claimant's appeal, holding that the talaq was effective. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no error of law in the tribunal's failure to consider English law on the recognition of foreign divorces and the effect of sections 45 to 54 of the Family Law Act 1986. It was not in dispute that the English conflict of laws rules judge a person's capacity to marry by the law of the person's domicile immediately before the marriage and that the claimant and Mosabir Ali were domiciled in Bangladesh at the time of their marriage. The claimant's capacity to marry Mosabir Ali, under the law of Bangladesh, depended on the validity of her earlier divorce. If under the law of Bangladesh the claimant's divorce was recognised as valid at the time of the marriage, she had capacity to marry Mosabir Ali, regardless of the English rules on the recognition of foreign divorces (paragraphs 11 to 18);
2.	foreign law is a question of fact (paragraph 20);
3.	it is only on questions of legal principle that there is an obligation to follow the decisions of Commissioners, or the courts. Expressing a conclusion about foreign law is not deciding a question of legal principle. It is the making of a finding of fact on evidence (paragraph 21);
4.	a finding in a decision of a Commissioner or a court constitutes evidence of foreign law. If there is no other evidence before an appeal tribunal or a Commissioner, then a finding of fact on foreign law should be accepted. If there are conflicting findings than an evaluation must be undertaken of the weight to be given to the competing items of evidence before reaching a conclusion of fact. If there are not conflicting findings in existing decisions, a party may argue on the basis of other expert evidence that the finding is wrong or inapplicable. The general principle is that the burden of proof of foreign law lies on the party who relies on it (paragraph 24);
5.	the tribunal was entitled to reach its conclusion on the evidence before it, on the basis that the findings on the law of Bangladesh in the Commissioner's decisions relied on by the adjudication officer were not related to the period of the ""hiatus"" in the law in Bangladesh (paragraph 30).

The claimant, who was employed by the Benefits Agency, suffered personal injury as a result of an assault which occurred whilst she was on sick leave. The perpetrator of the assault was a neighbour whom the claimant had reported for claiming benefit while working, and who had attacked the claimant in the claimant's own front drive.  The adjudication officer refused an industrial accident declaration but the claimant successfully appealed to a tribunal.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who dismissed the appeal, holding that the claimant's injuries were caused by an accident ""arising out of and in the course of"" her employment for the purposes of entitlement to industrial injuries benefit under section 94(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.

The applicant had suffered from vibration white finger prior to it being first prescribed as an industrial disease on 1 April 1985.  From 1 October 1986, section 60 of the Social Security Act 1975, making provision for special hardship allowance was repealed and reduced earnings allowance was introduced in its place.  The claimant claimed disablement benefit on 1 November 1989 and was awarded a disablement gratuity based on an assessment of 8% from 1 April 1985 for life. He claimed reduced earnings allowance on 22 August 1991, apparently seeking payment from 1 November 1989.  The adjudication officer awarded reduced earnings allowance from 22 May 1991.  The claimant appealed, seeking reduced earnings allowance from 1 April 1985.  The tribunal treated the claim as having been made in respect of the period from 1 April 1985 but allowed the appeal only to the extent of awarding reduced earnings allowance from 1 November 1989.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.  By then, the Secretary of State had decided that the claim for reduced earnings allowance could be treated as a claim for that benefit in respect of the period from 1 October 1986 but it was argued on behalf of the adjudication officer that a claim for special hardship allowance by the claimant could not succeed because section 1(2)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 provided that a person should not be entitled to any benefit ""except disablement benefit or reduced earnings allowance"" in respect of any period more than 12 months before the date of claim.  

The Commissioner held that the tribunal had exceeded their jurisdiction in treating the claim as having been made in respect of a period before 1 November 1989 (that question being one for the Secretary of State) but also held that the term ""disablement benefit"" in section 1(2)(b) encompassed special hardship allowance.  He allowed the appeal, finding that the claimant had good cause for the delay in claiming both special hardship allowance and reduced earnings allowance, and he directed the adjudication officer to refer to the Secretary of State the question whether the claim for reduced earnings allowance should be treated as a claim for special hardship allowance.  The Chief Adjudication Officer and the Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that no claim for special hardship allowance made since 1 October 1986 could succeed because section 60 of the Social Security Act 1975 had been repealed from that date and the claimant did not have an acquired or accrued right to special hardship allowance which, by virtue of section 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978, would not be affected by the repeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the court was not concerned with a two stage enquiry, first deciding whether there was a right and then deciding whether it was an acquired or accrued right but was concerned with the single question: has the claimant established that at the time of repeal he had a right?; 
2.	a mere hope or expectation of acquiring a right is insufficient but an entitlement, even if inchoate or contingent, suffices and the fact that further steps may still be necessary to prove that entitlement existed before repeal, or to prove its true extent, does not preclude it from being a right;
3.	whether or not there is an acquired right depends on whether at the date of the repeal the claimant has an entitlement (at least contingent) to money or other certain benefit receivable by him provided only that he takes all appropriate steps by way of notices and/or claims thereafter: Hamilton Gell v White [1922] 2 KB 422; County Council of Moray [1992] SLT 236; Convex Ltd's Patent [1980] REC 423; Plewa v.

The upper electrode of each machine was pneumatically powered and came down with a considerable impact to push together the pieces of metal, at which moment an electric charge provided the heat to effect the weld.  An adjudication officer decided that the claimant had not worked in a prescribed occupation, but this decision was reversed by a social security appeal tribunal.  The adjudication officer appealed to a Commissioner, who allowed the appeal, deciding that, although a spot welding machine was both pneumatic and percussive, the machine itself could not be regarded as a tool and it was necessary to consider whether the electrodes qualified as tools.  He held that the electrodes could not be described as tools because it was the current that effected the weld and not the electrodes themselves.  The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the electrodes were tools, being the mechanical version of the hand held hammer and their additional role of heating the metal did not detract from that function;

Attendance at these accidents had resulted in the claimant suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The adjudication officer initially refused his claim. The social security appeal tribunal held that the claimant was incapable of work and had the right to industrial injuries benefit. The Commissioner subsequently held that the tribunal decision should be set aside and declared that the claimant had suffered personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment in consequence of his attendance at the fatal accidents. The declaration was made in pursuance of section 44(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The adjudication officer appealed to the Court of Session which held that the words ""by accident"" should be interpreted as being synonymous with ""accidentally"" and also that there did not require to be a distinct causative event separate from the injury.

Held, allowing the appeal (Lord Hutton dissenting), that:

2.	the fact that a claimant had suffered stress or developed a physical or psychological illness as a result of a stressful occupation would not of itself qualify the claimant for an award of industrial injuries benefit;

The claimants were all in receipt of reduced earnings allowance. By virtue of the age conditions contained in Schedule 7, paragraphs 12 and 13, of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and regulation 3 of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries)(Regular Employment) Regulations 1990 (as amended), their allowances were either replaced by retirement allowance or frozen. The claimants appealed to social security appeal tribunals. In two cases the appeals were refused and in three cases they were allowed. All the cases were appealed to the Commissioner, raising common questions relating to the unequal age conditions between men and women. The claimants contended that the conditions discriminated against them unlawfully on the grounds of sex, contrary to the provisions of Article 4 of Council Directive 79/7/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security. The adjudication officers submitted that the conditions were excluded from the scope of the Directive by virtue of Article 7. 

The Commissioner referred three questions to the European Court of Justice:
(i)	whether Article 7 permits a Member State to impose unequal age conditions linked to the different pension ages for men and women under the statutory old age pension scheme in the case of a benefit having the characteristics of reduced earnings allowance, where the inequality is not necessary for any financial reason and was imposed many years after the two schemes were commenced and after the latest date for the Directive to be given full effect, 
(ii)	if so, what are the considerations that determine whether such conditions in Great Britain from 1988-89 onwards are necessary to ensure coherence between the two schemes or otherwise fall within the permitted exclusion in Article 7, and 
(iii)	in the event that the unequal age conditions are not within the permitted exclusion in Article 7, how should the doctrine of direct effect be applied.

Held, that:
1.	from 1986, a succession of legislative amendments affecting reduced earnings allowance were adopted to reduce the number of persons entitled to receive it by discontinuing payment to persons no longer of working age through conditions based on the statutory retirement age. As a result of those changes there is coherence between reduced earnings allowance and the old age pension scheme, and the maintenance of the rules at issue is objectively necessary to preserve such coherence;
2. discrimination of the kind at issue is objectively and necessarily linked to the difference between retirement age for men and women, so that it is covered by the derogation for which Article 7(1)(a) of the Directive provides.",1,117,205,,

A disablement pension is payable for an industrial accident or prescribed disease which results in at least 14% disablement, including aggregation with disablement from any existing assessment.  For claims made prior to 1 October 1986 this figure was 20%, with a disablement gratuity payable on lower assessments. On 19 November 1989 the claimant applied for disablement benefit, on the grounds that he suffered from prescribed disease A11.  He was finally assessed as 7% disabled from   1 April 1985 for life.  A disablement gratuity was awarded, as the claim was treated as made on 30 September 1986.

The claimant made a further claim for disablement benefit on 26 May 1992, on the basis that he suffered from prescribed disease D4.  A medical appeal tribunal gave a final assessment of 8% from 1 January 1960 for life.  On 24 August 1995 an adjudication officer refused a disablement pension, the assessment being under 14%. In the meantime, on 1 August 1995, the claimant applied for a review of his assessment for prescribed disease A11 on grounds of unforeseen aggravation.  On 4 September 1995, an adjudicating medical authority found him to be 8% disabled from 3 May 1995 for life.  On 15 February 1996, an adjudication officer aggregated the assessment for D4 with that for A11, giving a total of 9% after deducting 7% for the disablement gratuity paid in respect of the latter disease.
On 10 May 1996, an adjudication officer reviewed the decision of 24 August 1995, aggregating with the D4 assessment the percentage awarded for A11.  The claimants total disablement was assessed as 16%, with no deduction made for the gratuity (applying CI/522/1993), with effect from the date CI/522/1993 was decided.  This was pursuant to section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. On appeal, a tribunal awarded the claimant a disablement pension from 3 May 1995.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	where there has been a final assessment of disablement on a claim made before 1 October 1986, on any review of that assessment following unforeseen aggravation, or on any further claim for an new disease or accident, made on or after that date, the threshold for disablement pension will be 14 (not 20) percent, and no disablement gratuity will be payable (para. 12);
2.	when an assessment of disablement resulting from an accident or disease is being determined following  a claim or review, aggregation with other existing assessments must always be considered (para. 13);
3.	there is no power to make any deductions from the assessment of this primary accident or disease (the subject of the claim or review) in respect of any percentage on which a disablement gratuity has already been paid.  If he was wrong, the Commissioner considered there was only power to make such a deduction for up to seven years from the beginning of the period of the assessment in respect of which the gratuity was paid (para. 13);
4.	a deduction of the percentage in respect of which a disablement gratuity was paid can be made from the disablement assessment given on another accident or disease, where that is aggregated with the assessment of the primary accident or disease.  There is, however, no power to make such deductions beyond seven years from the beginning of the period covered by the assessment in respect of which the gratuity was paid.

An adjudication officer found that the claimant did not satisfy the all work test and reviewed the claimants award of incapacity benefit, deciding that he was no longer entitled to it.

They did not award the claimant any points under that descriptor and dismissed the claimants appeal because he scored only 14 points on other descriptors. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

The adjudication officer reviewed her award of incapacity benefit and decided that she was no longer entitled to it. The claimant appealed, saying that her condition fluctuated wildly. The tribunal considered whether the claimant could carry out the activities in the all work test regularly and repeatedly and said that they had not relied on a snapshot of her circumstances. They accepted the doctors findings and dismissed the claimants appeal. She appealed and her case was heard by a Tribunal of Commissioners.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. although incapacity benefit was a daily benefit, it was not necessary for the all work test literally to be satisfied in respect of each day of a period of incapacity (paragraph 13);
2. in those cases where relevant descriptors were expressed in terms that the claimant cannot, rather than sometimes cannot, perform an activity, one should not stray too far from an arithmetical approach that considered what the claimants abilities were most of the time during what was claimed to be a period of incapacity, but the frequency of bad days, the length of periods of bad days and intervening periods, the severity of the claimants disablement on both good and bad days and the unpredictability of bad days were all relevant when considering whether a claimant could be treated as satisfying the all work test on those days when it was literally satisfied but also other intervening days (paragraph 15);
3. the tribunal had not erred in their approach to the variability of the claimants condition (paragraph 20);
4. it was unclear whether the doctors assessment took account of the claimants fatigue or whether his comment that the claimant got tired easily was intended to qualify an assessment that did not take account of the fatigue and therefore the tribunals decision was erroneous in point of law because, in accepting his findings, they either misdirected themselves as to the relevance of the claimants tiredness or else they inadequately explained their decision (paragraph 21).

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the £30,000 charge for part of the appellant's existing liabilities was an attempt by the building society to recoup some of their losses made on the sale of the appellant's previous home and did not, therefore, represent a loan taken out for the purpose of purchasing the new property;
2. even on the assumption that without it the acquisition could not have taken place, the charge was not a necessary expense incurred in connection with the purchase of the property for the purposes of paragraph 7(3)(a) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, nor was it ""paying off another loan"" for the purposes of paragraph 7(3)(b);

The claimant was refused income support after the first four weeks in each of three periods he had spent in Portugal.  A tribunal dismissed his appeal and he appealed to the Commissioner, contending firstly that, as his applicable amount included both a disability premium and sums in respect of his family, his income support was an invalidity benefit and a family benefit within Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and was exportable under Article 10; secondly that he had a positive right to income support as a special non-contributory cash benefit within Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) 1247/92; and thirdly that he was assisted by the transitional provisions in Article 2(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1247/92 because income support was a ""special non-contributory benefit granted in addition to a pension"" due to the existence of the disability premium within the income support scheme.  The Commissioner rejected those submissions.  He held (paragraphs 8 to 14) that income support did not fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 before its amendment by Council Regulation (EEC) 1247/92 and he also rejected the claimant's second and third arguments.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the language of Article 10a recognised that special non-contributory benefits were granted in accordance with the legislation of the Member State in which the claimant resided and, as domestic legislation expressly provided for the withholding of income support during the periods of the claimant's temporary absence from the United Kingdom, the claimant could have no positive right to income support during his absence;  
2.	Article 2(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1247/92 applied to a special non-contributory benefit which was paid as a complement or supplement to a pension and it was not enough that the claimant received income support in parallel to his invalidity benefit as there was not a sufficient nexus between the two benefits.",1,246,119,,

The claimant was a student in receipt of income support.  He abandoned his course of studies on 27 April 1995 and was told that he would have to repay part of his student grant.  He sought a review of his award of income support on the ground that he was no longer a student but the adjudication officer decided that he should continue to take the student grant into account.  On 24 May 1995, the claimant's local education authority requested the repayment of the portion of his grant paid in respect of the period after the date of abandonment.  On 25 September 1995, a social security appeal tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal against the adjudication officer's decision.  On a further appeal, the Commissioner reversed the tribunal's decision and held that the proportion of the grant attributable to the remainder of the term after the date of abandonment was held under a constructive trust impressed with the obligation to repay the local education authority and accordingly should not have been taken into account when assessing his income support entitlement after the date of abandonment. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the remainder of the grant payment was not impressed with a constructive trust as the local education authority did not retain a proprietary right in the monies and no fiduciary obligation had been created and, further, by the time of the abandonment of the claimant's course he had already spent the entire grant so that there was nothing remaining upon which any kind of resulting trust could operate; 
2.	but, distinguishing R. v. Bolton Supplementary Benefits Appeal Tribunal Ex p. Fordham [1981] 1 All ER 50, monies that a claimant was under an immediate obligation to repay did not amount to ""income"" for the purposes of either the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 or the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987;
3.	there was no immediate liability to repay a precise sum on the date the course was abandoned, but after the local education authority invoiced the claimant on 24 May 1995 there was an undisputed and immediate obligation to pay and, accordingly, the portion of the grant which related to the period from 24 May 1995 lost the character of income from that date.

The claimant, who was British, had worked in France for the majority of the period from 1980 to 1988 although he continued to pay United Kingdom National Insurance contributions and returned occasionally for visits.  Following six months' employment in the United Kingdom, he returned to France and was employed continually there until late 1994, when he was made redundant.  He returned to the United Kingdom on 8 January 1995 and claimed income support, stating that he no longer wished to take a job that entailed having to spend long periods working abroad.  His claim was disallowed on the ground that he was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom and was therefore a ""person from abroad"" within regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.  A tribunal allowed his appeal on the ground that he had shown a settled purpose of making the United Kingdom his regular abode for a significant period of the future, as at the date of claim.  On a further appeal by the adjudication officer, the Commissioner held, in an interim decision, that the concept of habitual residence required not only that a claimant have a settled intention of residing in the United Kingdom but also that he had actually resided there for an appreciable period.  He found that the claimant had become habitually resident in the United Kingdom from 4 March 1995 (eight weeks after his arrival) but, in relation to the period before then, he referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether making entitlement to income support conditional upon habitual residence was compatible with Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome, in circumstances where a person had worked and been habitually resident in one Member State and had then exercised the right to freedom of movement for workers to move to, and work in, another Member State before finally returning to the first Member State in order to seek work.

 Held, that:
1.	before considering Article 48 of the Treaty, it must first be determined whether the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 provide the national court with the guidance it needs in order to adjudicate in the case pending before it (paragraph 21);
2.	by virtue of its listing in Annex IIa to Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, income support is a special non-contributory benefit, governed by Article 10a (paragraph 24);
3.	under Article 10a, payment of a benefit such as income support is conditional upon the claimant residing in the territory of the Member State under whose legislation he is entitled to that benefit and, pursuant to Article 1(h), ""residence"" means ""habitual residence"" for the purposes of the Regulation and therefore has a Community-wide meaning (paragraphs 25 and 28);
4.	the phrase ""the Member State in which they reside"" in Article 10a refers to the State in which the persons concerned habitually reside and where the habitual centre of their interests is to be found and, in that context, account should be taken in particular of the claimant's family circumstances, his reasons for moving, the length and continuity of his residence, whether he is in stable employment and his intention as it appears from all the circumstances (paragraph 29);
5.	for the purposes of that assessment, the length of residence in the Member State in which the benefit is claimed cannot be regarded as an intrinsic element of the concept of residence within Article 10a (paragraph 30);
6.	therefore, Articles 10a and 1(h) preclude the Member State of origin - in the case of a person who has exercised his right to freedom of movement in order to establish himself in another Member State, in which he has worked and set up his habitual residence, and who has returned to the Member State of his origin, where his family lives, in order to seek work - from making entitlement to a benefit within Article 10a conditional upon habitual residence in that State, which presupposes not only an intention to reside there, but also completion of an appreciable period of residence there.

The claimant was absent from work through sickness and was paid sick pay in arrears. His employment was terminated on the day he received his last sick pay. He immediately claimed income support. His claim was disallowed because, in calculating the claimant's income, the adjudication officer took account of the last payment of sick pay as, by virtue of regulation 35(2) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, it was not earnings and, by virtue of regulation 29(2), it fell to be taken into account over the four weeks after it was paid. The claimant's appeal to a tribunal was dismissed as was his appeal to the Commissioner. He then appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that regulation 29(2) was ultra vires and was irrational because it required a claimant to make one month's sick pay last two months and it created an anomaly because employed earners had their last payment of earnings disregarded under regulation 36(2) of, and paragraph 1 of Schedule 8 to the 1987 regulations.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The Adjudication Officer decided that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom at the date of claim. On appeal, the tribunal decided that the claimant had lost her right to reside under Council Directive 68/360/EEC when her employment ended and that on the facts of the case, she was also not actually resident in the United Kingdom. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	   the decision that the claimant was not actually resident in the United Kingdom was wrong since this was not supported by the tribunal's findings of fact;
2.	   the tribunal's unstated assumption that the claimant could not be habitually resident combined with the failure to apply European Community law as part of the ""habitual residence"" test were errors of law (paragraphs 10 and 11);  
3.	   whether a person remained a worker after her employment ended depended on the circumstances of her leaving, in particular her intentions and actions at the time, which could indicate whether she was still in the labour market or not (following the Commissioner's analysis of Lair v Universitat Hannover [1988] ECR 3161 in R(IS)12/98) (paragraph 14);
4.	   whether the claimant was a worker for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 was independent of any other rights she might have under Council Directive 68/360/EEC which had been implemented by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 (SI 1994 No. 1895). The residence permit was a recognition of the claimant's rights of residence and not a formal grant of those rights. The claimant's right to reside was derived directly from her rights under Article 48 of the European Community Treaty (see Procureur du Roi v Royer [1976] ECR 497 and Roux v Belgian State [1991] ECR 1-273) and subject only to the condition that she was carrying on an economic activity within the meaning of Articles 48, 52 or 59 (paragraph 20); 
5.	   as the claimant did not require a work permit, no limit could have been imposed on her under Article 12 of the 1994 Order. Furthermore, the imposition of any limit to someone with a job lasting between three and twelve months was not automatic but discretionary (paragraph 23).

The claimant separated from his wife in 1995. The following year, the claimant received a severance payment from his employer. The claimant entered a formal separation agreement with his wife to settle their financial affairs including a payment representing a one-third share of the value of his pension fund. At the date of his claim for income support, the claimant had £15,500 in his bank account. This sum was due to be paid to his wife at a future date under the terms of the separation agreement. A social security appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision that the claimant had in excess of the prescribed level (£8,000). The claimant appealed to the Commissioner contending that the funds in his bank account should not be regarded as capital within the meaning of regulation 46 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. He further contended that these funds were held by him in trust for his wife.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. the funds in the claimants bank account, being derived from the severance payment, constituted capital (paragraph 9);
2. in determining whether this was capital possessed by the claimant for the purposes of regulation 49, it was necessary to consider the ways in which capital might be otherwise held:
(a)	Trust
applying Clark Taylor & Co Limited v. Quality Site Development (Edinburgh) Limited 1981 SC 11, while it was competent for the claimant to be both truster and trustee, there had been no delivery of the subject of trust and nothing had been done, by way of intimation or otherwise, to confer on the claimants wife a right to seek payment from him as trustee. Furthermore, for the purposes of section 1(2)(iii) of the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, there was nothing in writing to prove the existence of a trust (paragraphs 11 and 12);
(b)	Matrimonial Property
in terms of section 10(3)(a) of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985, the severance payment could not be matrimonial property since the parties had ceased to cohabit before the severance payment had been made. Tyrell 1990 SCLR 244 was distinguished since it was not the pension fund itself which was being divided (paragraph 13);
(c)	Agency
for the purposes of Scots law, no contract of agency, express or implied, could be said to exist between the parties (paragraph 14);
3. the term encumbrance in regulation 46(2) is not known in Scots law. It had to be interpreted as being something attached to the funds which prevented their disposal. It was also necessary to distinguish between moral and legal obligations. Further, following R(SB) 2/83, no account could be taken of liabilities (paragraph 15).",1,30,,,

Under regulation 23 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 as amended by the Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1996, every decision of a social security appeal tribunal had to be recorded in summary in a decision notice.  The chairman then had the power to issue a full statement of the tribunals decision, stating their findings and reasons, at any time and had a duty to provide one on a request made within 21 days after the decision notice was sent or given to the parties.

In CIS/3299/1997, the claimants claim for income support was disallowed on the ground that he was neither available for work nor exempt from the requirement that he should be available for work.  In reaching that conclusion, the adjudication officer overlooked the question whether the claimants circumstances fell within regulation 6(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 which applied to people whose ability to work was restricted by disability.  The claimant appealed, arguing that his disability meant that he was unable to work to a sufficient extent but not giving all the information required for a decision as to whether regulation 6(a) applied to him.  He did not attend the hearing before the tribunal and his appeal was dismissed.  He sought leave to appeal within 21 days, without specifically asking for a full statement of the tribunals decision and leave was refused by the chairman who did not issue a full statement.  The claimant was granted leave to appeal by a Commissioner.

In CIB/4189/1997, the claimant was held by a tribunal not to satisfy the all work test.  She did not ask for a full statement of the tribunals decision and did not ask the chairman for leave to appeal until more than 21 days had elapsed.  Leave to appeal was refused by the chairman, who did not issue a full statement, but was granted by a Commissioner.

There was raised on both appeals the question whether the Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear a case in the absence of a full statement of the tribunals decision, given that the time for applying to a chairman for leave to appeal was the period of three months after a full statement of the tribunals decision was issued and that a copy of the full statement was to be annexed to an application for leave.

Held, allowing the appeal in CIS/3299/1997 and dismissing the appeal in CIB/4189/1997, that:
1.	there was a duty to give reasons for a tribunal's decision only if a full statement of the tribunals decision was requested or provided and a summary of grounds in a decision notice could not be challenged for inadequacy (paragraphs 6 and 7);
2.	a tribunals decision would not be erroneous in point of law for breach of the chairmans duty to provide a full statement on a request made within 21 days if the decision notice in fact contained an adequate statement of reasons (paragraph 8);
3.	where there was no full statement of reasons a tribunal might be shown to have erred in law if the point of law was justiciable without there being evidence of the tribunal's reasoning or if sufficient evidence of their reasoning could be gleaned from the decision notice (paragraph 9);
4.	a chairman had no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal if no full statement had been issued but a Commissioner could grant leave if there were special reasons for doing so notwithstanding a failure to apply to a chairman within the specified time and could waive the requirement that a full statement be annexed to an application and, accordingly, had jurisdiction to hear an appeal even though no full statement had been issued (paragraphs 14 to 17);
5.	a tribunal had a duty to ensure that all relevant questions had been asked of a claimant but were not bound to ask questions that had already been asked by the Secretary of State or an adjudication officer (paragraph 31);
6.	the tribunal in CIS/3299/1997 had been unable to ask material questions relating to regulation 6(a) but fairness had not required an adjournment because the claimant had not been wholly unaware that the extent of his ability to work was relevant, the tribunal were entitled to take the view that the claimant would have been unlikely to succeed on that issue and the claimant had chosen not to appear before the tribunal (paragraph 32);
7.	the inquisitorial role of the tribunal required them to draw the claimants attention in their reasons to the material point previously overlooked by the adjudication officer, the decision notice in CIS/3299/1997 did not do so and, as the claimants application for leave to appeal had again referred to the extent of his ability to work, it should have been regarded as a request for a full statement made within 21 days and the tribunals decision was erroneous in point of law because no such statement had been provided (paragraphs 36 to 38);
8.	the tribunal in CIB/4189/1997 had not been obliged to ask the claimant about an activity with which she had previously told the Benefits Agency she had no difficulties and had not failed to ask her about other activities (paragraph 41);
9.	there was no reason why the chairman in CIB/4189/1997 should have issued a full statement and in the absence of one the tribunal's decision could not be impugned for inadequacy of reasons (paragraphs 40 and 42).",1,60,285,,

When her husband was sentenced to a term of imprisonment the claimant bought a smaller house on which she secured a loan. The claimants claim for income support was rejected because the adjudication officer decided that no housing costs could be included in her applicable amount because she had not met the 39 week qualifying period under paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. She appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, contending that she was claiming income support because of being abandoned by her husband and that therefore paragraph 8(3) applied so that she was entitled to include 50% of her housing costs in her applicable amount after 8 weeks and 100% after 26 weeks. The tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
abandoned in paragraph 8(3) meant the deliberate withdrawal by the partner of his society and financial support from the claimant and, accordingly, the separation forced on the claimants husband by imprisonment and any consequent failure on his part to support the claimant was not abandonment.",1,174,,,

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	sections 137(2)(c) and (d) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 are wide enough to allow the Secretary of State to provide that work which does not of itself result in payment is to be treated as remunerative;

The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on Friday, 2 February 1996 and passed through immigration control before leaving the airport.  She claimed asylum at Lunar House on Monday, 5 February 1996.  On 6 February 1996, she claimed income support.  Her claim was disallowed by the adjudication officer on the ground that she had not claimed asylum on her arrival and so she was not an asylum seeker for the purposes of regulation 70(3A)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as amended by regulation 8 of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996.  A tribunal dismissed her appeal without making any findings as to why she had not claimed asylum until 5 February.  She appealed to the Commissioner.

2.	the term on his arrival was used deliberately, instead of any more precise term, in order to maintain a level of flexibility (paragraph 13), the extent of which was to be considered on a case by case basis (paragraph 21);
3.	it was not a universal test that asylum should have been claimed before clearing immigration control (paragraph 20);
4.	it was clear that Parliament intended that the words on his arrival should be so construed that a person who had arrived at Heathrow airport and claimed asylum at Lunar House three days after clearing immigration control and leaving the airport had not claimed asylum on . arrival (paragraph 23);

In CIS/16992/1996, the claimant was given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, having been sponsored by his son.  His son ceased to be able to support him and he was awarded income support from August 1995 until November 1995 when he went to India.  He returned to the United Kingdom on 14 March 1996 and again claimed income support.  His claim was disallowed by the adjudication officer on the ground that he was a person from abroad whose applicable amount was nil by virtue of regulation 21 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as amended by regulation 8(2) of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 and he was not entitled to urgent cases payments under regulation 70 of the 1987 Regulations as amended by regulation 8(3)(a) of the 1996 Regulations.  The amendments had come into force on 5 February 1996.  He appealed to a tribunal who allowed his appeal on the ground that he had been entitled to income support before the coming into force of these Regulations and so was entitled to transitional protection under regulation 12(2) of the 1996 Regulations.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

In CIS/2809/1997, the claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on 5 December 1995 and claimed asylum on 2 January 1996.  He was awarded income support which was paid until 1 February 1996.  On 2 February 1996, he started work.  He claimed income support again on 2 August 1996 and the adjudication officer disallowed his claim on the ground that he was not an asylum seeker for the purposes of regulation 70 of the 1987 Regulations as amended by regulation 8(3)(c) of the 1996 Regulations because he had not claimed asylum on his arrival.  He appealed to a tribunal who allowed his appeal on the ground that he had been entitled to income support before the coming into force of these Regulations and so was entitled to transitional protection under regulation 12(1) of the 1996 Regulations.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.
In CFC/1580/1997, the claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on 30 September 1994 and claimed asylum on 10 October 1994.  She was subsequently awarded family credit and was entitled to it at the time the 1996 Regulations came into force on 5 February 1996.  An adjudication officer disallowed a renewal claim made in September 1996 on the ground that, under regulation 3(1)(aa) and (1A) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 as amended by regulation 6 of the 1996 Regulations, the claimant could not be treated as being in Great Britain because she was an asylum seeker.  She appealed to a tribunal who allowed her appeal on the ground that she had been entitled to family credit before the coming into force of the 1996 Regulations, her entitlement had not been reviewed and so, under regulation 12(3) of the 1996 Regulations, the 1987 Regulations continued to have effect as if regulation 6 of the 1996 Regulations had not been made.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, by the Commissioner, allowing all three appeals, that:
1.	   decisions on substantive issues of social security law made by the High Court in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction were to be regarded as made in a jurisdiction co-ordinate with that of Commissioners and therefore a Commissioner was not bound to follow a decision of a single High Court judge although he should do so unless convinced that it was wrong (paragraph 19);
2.	   the decision of Dyson J in Regina v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Vijeikis, Okito and Zaheer [1998] COD 49 was to be followed and a claimant was not entitled to transitional protection under regulation 12 of the 1996 Regulations unless he or she was entitled to the relevant benefit at the time those Regulations came into force on 5 February 1996 (paragraph 20);
3.	   the claimant in CIS/2809/1997 could not rely on Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 because any discrimination which a refugee might suffer under the law of the Member State where he or she had claimed asylum fell within the scope of that law and must therefore be dealt with within the framework of the internal legal system of that State (paragraph 26);
4.	   regulation 12(3) of the 1996 Regulations should be construed so that transitional protection continued only during the period covered by the award of benefit that was current on 5 February 1996 (paragraph 35).

The Commissioner substituted his own decisions to the effect that the claimants were not entitled to benefit.  The claimant in CIS/2809/1997 appealed to the Court of Appeal.  By the time of the hearing he had been granted asylum and paid arrears of urgent cases payments of income support but, relying on Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, he contended he should have been paid income support at the ordinary rate.

Held, by the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	   in the absence of very specific indications to the contrary, a European Community provision did not apply to a case that was wholly internal to a single Member State and this was particularly the case where the provisions related to the freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services: Saunders [1979] ECR 1129; Uecker [1997] CMLR 963; Petit [1992] ECR 4973; 
2.	   the powers under which Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 was made were limited to powers to facilitate the movement of workers between Member States so that any construction that sought to extend the Regulation to cover cases where there was no such movement would render the Regulation ultra vires: Spruyt [1986] ECR 685;
3.	   a reference to the European Court of Justice was not necessary because in Petit the Court had already held that Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 could not be applied to activities that were confined within one Member of State.

In September 1993 the claimant commenced a course of study leading to a BTEC National Diploma.  She completed the course at the end of June 1995 having attained her nineteenth birthday on 15 January 1995.  On 2 February 1995 she claimed income support and requested that it be backdated to 15 January 1995.  At the hearing the presenting officer submitted that the issue before the tribunal was whether the claimant had since 15 January 1995 been attending a full-time course of study.  There was before the tribunal a letter from the college which stated that the college and the Further Education Funding Council no longer designated programmes as full-time or part-time as students were able to take separate modules to build towards a final qualification and confirmed certain facts about the claimants actual current attendance.  The tribunal decided the case against the claimant.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1. following the decision of the Court of Appeal in OConnor v Chief Adjudication Officer [1999] Education Law Reports 209, (reported as R(IS) 7/99), the question of whether the course is a full-time course of study is to be decided according to the reasoning of Hobhouse LJ in Chief Adjudication Officer v Webber [1997]  4 All ER 274, (reported as R(IS) 15/98), meaning that a course which from the outset does not require full-time attendance or does not have a fixed and determined character is not a full-time course; 

2. that this is so even if the claimant has actually attended the course full-time throughout (paragraph 17).  The evidence before the tribunal raised the possibility that the claimants course was not full-time.  The tribunal did not properly investigate that point in the light of the decision in OConnor (supra).  

The case was referred back to another tribunal with directions as to relevant evidence (paragraph 21).",1,263,,,

The claimant, a widow then aged 55, arrived in the United Kingdom on 22 August 1994. Previously she had lived all her life in Bangladesh although her late husband had lived in the United Kingdom at one time. She possessed a right of abode in the United Kingdom and stated that she intended to settle here. Her late husbands brother and his family lived in the United Kingdom and she was staying with them pending finding permanent accommodation. She claimed income support with effect from 26th August but the claim was disallowed by the adjudication officer on the grounds that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom and so was a person from abroad as defined in regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 17 of Schedule 7 to the Regulations, her applicable amount was nil.

The claimant appealed against this decision and the appeal was allowed by a social security appeal tribunal who found that ...the appellant is habitually resident as on the date of arrival in the United Kingdom and entitled to income support therefrom. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal on the grounds that, for a person to be habitually resident in a new country, an appreciable period of residence in the country must have been shown as well as a settled intention to reside there. The Commissioner ordered that the case be remitted to a new tribunal for further enquiry into the facts.

On appeal by the claimant, the Court of Appeal (Morritt LJ and Sir Christopher Staughton, Thorpe LJ dissenting) upheld the Commissioners decision. The judgments of the Court of Appeal can be found at [1998] 2 All ER 728. The claimant appealed to the House of Lords. 

Held, unanimously dismissing the appeal, that:

1. as a matter of ordinary language, a person is not habitually resident in a country unless he has taken up residence and lived there for a period. There is no reason to suppose that Parliament intended any different meaning when using the expression in the Income Support regulations;

2. a person coming to the United Kingdom for the first time and expressing an intention to settle here cannot be accepted as habitually resident until he can show residence in fact for a period which shows that the residence has become habitual and will or is likely to continue to be habitual. It is a question of fact to be determined on the circumstances of each case whether and when habitual residence has been established. The requisite period is not a fixed one and may in an appropriate case be short;

3. the position of someone coming to the United Kingdom other than for the first time is different. In some cases the adjudication officer might be satisfied that the person concerned is resuming an habitual residence previously had. 

The House of Lords confirmed the order remitting the case to a new tribunal.",1,240,,,

The claimant, an Italian national, claimed income support on 18 December 1995. She had arrived in England from Spain with her baby on 7 December 1995 after her marriage had broken down, intending to find her own accommodation and employment. She stayed with friends and could only find very short term work. The claimant had previously resided in England between 1973 and 1986. Between 1986 and 1990, there were two periods when the claimant lived and worked in England. In October 1990, she returned to Spain to live with her husband. The adjudication officer decided that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom and was therefore a person whose applicable amount was nil. 
On appeal, the tribunal held that the claimant was habitually resident from 8 March 1996, (applying the appreciable period principle set out in R(IS)2/00). They expressed no view on an argument based on Article 10a(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71, that the claimants residence in Spain immediately before leaving counted as part of the appreciable period. 

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The adjudication officer submitted that the effect of the European Court of Justices judgment in Swaddling (Case C-90/97) (reported as R(IS) 6/99) was to enable a person previously habitually resident in the United Kingdom to resume habitual residence immediately on return if there were sufficient links with the previous life in the United Kingdom to be regarded as picking up the pieces of the former habitual residence. It was not necessary for the person to have worked in another Member State.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the adjudication officers submission was wrong (paragraphs 12 and 13); the particular answer given by the European Court of Justice could only be relied on directly in cases which were substantially on all fours with Swaddling. Otherwise the principles set out in the judgment would have to be applied by reference to all the relevant factors (paragraphs 14 and 15);
2. there was no inconsistency between paragraphs 29 and 30 of the European Court of Justices judgment in Swaddling, as the reference in paragraph 30 to the length of residence not being an intrinsic factor in the concept of residence meant that it remained a relevant factor, but it was not essential (paragraphs 16 and 17);
3. on the facts of the present case, the claimant was resident for the purposes of Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 in the United Kingdom on the date of claim (paragraphs 19 and 20) and could not be denied income support on the ground that she was not habitually resident here (paragraph 21).",1,240,,,

The claimant and her son borrowed a sum of money for home improvements. The claimant and her son agreed between themselves that each would meet one half of the repayments. However, the son had failed to pay the lender and substantial arrears had resulted. The lender had brought possession proceedings. The claimant asked for a review of her award of income support so as to include in her housing costs her sons share of the interest. The adjudication officer decided the claimant was only entitled to one half because he considered the claimants son also to be liable for one half. The tribunal found as facts that the loan was secured by way of mortgage and that the claimant and her son were jointly and severally responsible for repayment and that the loan was for home improvements. They dismissed her appeal. The claimant appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	assuming, as had been found by the tribunal, that the claimants liability to the lender was joint and several, then she was under an obligation to pay the whole interest. She would therefore be treated as responsible for the whole of the expenditure relating to housing costs unless paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 applied. Whether paragraph 6(2) applied was a question of fact. On the facts, as the claimants son did not meet his share, the claimants responsibility for the whole of the interest remained unaffected. R(IS) 19/95 was considered;
2.	although the tribunals findings of fact that the claimant and her son were parties to a mortgage deed was not supported by documentary evidence and their finding that the claimants liability was joint and several depended on a letter to that effect from the lender, those findings would be assumed to be correct for the purpose of the appeal.

The claimant had been in receipt of income support since 1988. He lived with his mother, and as he was unable to manage his own affairs she had throughout acted as his appointee for social security purposes. The claimant had a building society account containing savings belonging to him. The balance in the account was disclosed to the Department of Social Security in March 1991. Thereafter, from time to time, his mother deposited sums to the account out of her own pension. These were intended as gifts to him. The balance increased until March 1995 when the Department of Social Security became aware of the passbook entries. The balances in the account from August 1992 had been such as to give rise to an overpayment of income support.

An adjudication officer decided that the overpaid benefit was recoverable from the claimants mother as his appointee. On appeal the tribunal found that she had failed to make the disclosure that was reasonably to be expected of her in the circumstances and that the overpaid sum was recoverable from her.
The claimants mother appealed to the Commissioner. The adjudication officer, relying on the Commissioners decision in CIS/332/1993, submitted that the tribunal had erred in law in not drawing a distinction between failures of disclosure by the claimants mother in her capacity as his appointee and other failures for which she was responsible in her personal capacity.

Held, allowing the appeal only to the extent of correcting a calculation error, that:
1.	 it is well established that the acts or omissions of an agent may be imputed to his principal, so as to affect the principals legal position and that a person is not relieved from general civil or statutory responsibility for his own acts or omissions merely because he is acting on behalf of someone else (para. 17);
2.	there was nothing in previously decided cases to warrant departing from these principles or attempting to draw a distinction between what a person omits to disclose as appointee or personally. Such a distinction was not helpful in a case such as the present where the claimants mother was taking the whole of the responsibility for dealing with the claimants social security affairs and it was her silence, after she had given the passbook balance in March 1991, that led to the claimant getting too much benefit  (paras. 12, 13 and 18);
3.	 where an appointee acting on behalf of a claimant has been responsible for a failure to disclose a material fact and benefit has been overpaid as a result, concurrent rights of recovery exist against the appointee as the person directly responsible, and against the claimant who, through his appointee, has failed to disclose the material fact (para. 19).

Her fear diminished eventually and she returned to the United Kingdom on 2 December 1996 in order to have her baby. Her new partner, who was running a restaurant, remained in Cyprus.

Alternatively, she had acquired habitual residence immediately on arrival or shortly thereafter upon re-establishing her home. Lastly, as a person who wished to establish herself in the United Kingdom to pursue activities as a self-employed person or to provide services here under Article 1(1)(a) of the Directive, she should be deemed to be habitually resident as a person with a right to reside in the United Kingdom pursuant to Council Directive 73/148/EEC. The tribunal rejected the arguments but decided that the claimant was habitually resident from 5 March 1997 i.e. the date of hearing. Her baby had been born about five weeks earlier. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The adjudication officer submitted that following the European Court of Justices ruling in Swaddling v. Adjudication Officer (case C-90/97) [R(IS) 6/99], the tribunal had erred by not considering Article 10a(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71. He also submitted that the Commissioner could substitute a decision that the claimant was resident in the United Kingdom from 17 December 1996 for the purposes of Article 10a and was not precluded from entitlement by the habitual residence rule.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant fell within the personal scope of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 by virtue of her previous work and social security contributions in the United Kingdom and her French nationality. The effect of the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice in Swaddling was that the claimant was potentially entitled to the protection of Article 10a(1) of the Regulation prior to 5 March 1997. Even though the point was not argued before the tribunal, it was an error of law to have failed to deal with it. The tribunals decision had to be set aside although the Commissioner was unable to give a final decision on Article 10a(1) on the basis of the evidence before him, in particular because of the lack of evidence about the state of the claimants relationship with her partner and their intentions (paras. 10 to 16);
2.	the tribunal did not err in law in their application of the actual habitual residence test. The argument that an appreciable period of residence was unnecessary in the light of Swaddling and the Court of Appeals decision in Nessa [1998] 2 All ER 728 was wrong. As the habitual residence rule was not introduced to implement any European Community obligation, it could not be interpreted generally by reference to Community legislation. Swaddling did not decide the meaning of the English habitual residence test, it decided the meaning of residence in the context of Article 10a, which could affect the circumstances in which a claimant in the United Kingdom could be denied income support on the basis of the habitual residence test. The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords had endorsed the general meaning of habitual residence in English law incorporating the requirement of an appreciable period of residence. It was doubted that Lord Slynns obiter remarks (at [1999] 1 WLR 1943) about a person resuming a habitual residence previously had were intended to apply whenever the person in question had previously been habitually resident here (paras. 17 to 22);
3.	the tribunal erred in its interpretation of Council Directive 73/148/EEC. A person has the right of residence when taking steps towards offering services to the public (or otherwise setting up as self employed). It is not necessary to reach the stage of actually providing services. A mere intention to become established was not sufficient. Exactly what steps will be sufficient will depend on the circumstances of individual cases (paras. 31 to 33). C10/95 (IS), a Northern Ireland decision, was considered at paragraph 27.

The claimant applied for severe disablement allowance from its inception on 29 November 1984.  Her claim was refused.  

Subsequently, on a reference by the Commissioner, the European Court of Justice found the provisions governing severe disablement allowance to be discriminatory: Johnson-v-Chief Adjudication Officer (11 July 1991).  That case came back to a Tribunal of Commissioners, who decided that the decision of the social security appeal tribunal had been in error of law: R(S) 1/95 (16 December 1991).
Following a further claim by the claimant, an adjudication officer reviewed the earlier refusal of benefit and decided that the claimant was entitled to severe disablement allowance from the date of the European Court of Justices decision, but no earlier, as this was the relevant determination in consequence of which the claimants benefit was reviewed: section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.  A social security appeal tribunal came to the same decision.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. section 69(1)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 concerns the effect of the determination of a court or Commissioner on the decision of the first tier adjudicating authority.  The decision of an adjudication officer can be found to be in error of law in the light of that determination, notwithstanding that it is the second tier appeal tribunal decision which is actually set aside by the Commissioner or court (paragraphs 12-16);
2. the decision of the adjudication officer in Johnson could only have been seen to be wrong in law after the decision of the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(S) 1/95.  Accordingly this was the date of the relevant determination within section 69(1)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (paragraphs 21-24);
3. the Commissioner left open the question of whether a ruling of the European Court of Justice on a reference could ever be a relevant determination(paragraph 25); 
4. the restrictions on backdating contained within section 69 were not contrary to European Community law as they were not less favourable than those applied to purely domestic cases, and they did not virtually or completely bar the exercise of rights under European Community law: Johnson v. Chief Adjudication Officer (No. 2) followed (paragraphs 28-30).

On allowing the appeal, the Commissioner substituted his own decision, that the claimant was entitled to SDA no earlier than the date of the final determination of R(S) 1/95 by the Tribunal of Commissioners.",1,249,121,,

The claimant was a Moroccan national, living in Great Britain, and in receipt of invalidity benefit.  His wife lived in Morocco.  She had never lived in the United Kingdom, and did not intend to do so.  The claimant made a claim for increase of invalidity benefit in respect of her.  That claim was disallowed by the adjudication officer.  On appeal, a tribunal decided that the claimants wife was absent from Great Britain and that, as a consequence and pursuant to section 113(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the increase was not payable: this disqualification could not be lifted, as the claimant was not residing with his wife within the meaning of regulation 13 of the Social Security (Persons Abroad) Regulations 1975 and regulations 2(1) and 4 of the Social Security Benefit (Persons Residing Together) Regulations 1977.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that the tribunal had failed to consider the effect of Article 41(1) of the Co-operation Agreement between the EC and the Kingdom of Morocco (Council Regulation (EEC) 2211/78) which provides for workers of Moroccan nationality to enjoy treatment in the field of social security free from discrimination.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	Article 41(1) of the Co-operation Agreement had direct effect (paragraph 9);
2.	the claimant, who had first become unemployed and then incapable of work, was a worker under Article 41(1) and both invalidity benefit and incapacity benefit came within that Article (paragraph 10);
3.    	an increase of invalidity benefit was not a family allowance for the purposes of Article 41(3), which had no application to the appeal (paragraph 14);
4.	the effect of the provisions under which the claimant had been disallowed an increase of invalidity benefit was that a man receiving invalidity benefit was entitled to an increase in respect of his wife if he resided with or supported her, but if she was absent abroad, only if he resided with her and, accordingly, applying the approach in OFlynn v. Adjudication Officer (Case C-237/94)(reported as R(IS) 4/98), the provisions indirectly discriminated against Moroccan workers in Great Britain, as they were intrinsically more likely to be disadvantaged by these provisions than were workers of British nationality (paragraph 17-19);
5.	the effect of those provisions could not be objectively justified and they could not therefore be applied to migrant workers covered by the Co-operation Agreement (paragraph 20);
6.	accordingly, in deciding whether the claimant was entitled to an increase of invalidity benefit, the ordinary rules in section 83(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 should be applied (paragraph 21).

Mr. Carter and Mr. Cocks argued that this had the result that the maintenance assessment was invalid. Mr. Harmon argued that the income which he alleged the parent with care was receiving should be taken into account in the assessment, but the tribunal rejected this on the grounds that paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 1 to the Act provided that a parent with care who was being paid income support should be treated as having no assessable income. In all three cases the tribunal held that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into the question of whether income support was properly payable to the parent with care. The absent parents appealed to a child support commissioner. Mr. Commissioner Rice decided the cases of Mr. Carter and Mr. Cocks together on 11 October 1996. Mr. Commissioner Angus decided the case of Mr. Harmon on 24 October 1996. 

Both Commissioners held that the reference in section 6 of the Act to income support being paid should be construed as meaning ""lawfully paid"". This had the result that if income support was not being lawfully paid to the parent with care, she could not validly authorise the Secretary of State under section 6 to take action and so the Secretary of State could not validly refer the application to the child support officer under section 11 and the child support officer could not validly make a maintenance assessment. However the question of whether income support was properly payable to the parent with care could only be determined by a social security adjudication officer. Therefore if the absent parent put forward substantial grounds for contending that income support was not properly payable to the parent with care, the child support officer should defer making an assessment or a child support appeal tribunal should adjourn consideration of the assessment and ask the adjudication officer to enquire into the matter. If the adjudication officer should subsequently find that income support was not properly payable  to the parent with care, the child support officer should decline to make an assessment or the child support appeal tribunal should direct that the assessment be cancelled. The Secretary of State appealed against the Commissioner's decision in all three cases to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

It does not depend on whether the benefit in question is benefit to which she is entitled.

Tribunal practice - inquisitorial role - whether duty to ask questions already asked by the Secretary of State - whether duty to adjourn when claimant absent

Under regulation 23 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 as amended by the Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1996, every decision of a social security appeal tribunal had to be recorded in summary in a decision notice.  The chairman then had the power to issue a full statement of the tribunal's decision, stating their findings and reasons, at any time and had a duty to provide one on a request made within 21 days after the decision notice was sent or given to the parties.

In CIS/3299/1997, the claimant's claim for income support was disallowed on the ground that he was neither available for work nor exempt from the requirement that he should be available for work.  In reaching that conclusion, the adjudication officer overlooked the question whether the claimant's circumstances fell within regulation 6(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 which applied to people whose ability to work was restricted by disability.  The claimant appealed, arguing that his disability meant that he was unable to work to a sufficient extent but not giving all the information required for a decision as to whether regulation 6(a) applied to him.  He did not attend the hearing before the tribunal and his appeal was dismissed.  He sought leave to appeal within 21 days, without specifically asking for a full statement of the tribunal's decision and leave was refused by the chairman who did not issue a full statement.  The claimant was granted leave to appeal by a Commissioner.

In CIB/4189/1997, the claimant was held by a tribunal not to satisfy the all work test.  She did not ask for a full statement of the tribunal's decision and did not ask the chairman for leave to appeal until more than 21 days had elapsed.  Leave to appeal was refused by the chairman, who did not issue a full statement, but was granted by a Commissioner.

There was raised on both appeals the question whether the Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear a case in the absence of a full statement of the tribunal's decision, given that the time for applying to a chairman for leave to appeal was the period of three months after a full statement of the tribunal's decision was issued and that a copy of the full statement was to be annexed to an application for leave.

Held, allowing the appeal in CIS/3299/1997 and dismissing the appeal in CIB/4189/1997, that:
1.	there was a duty to give reasons for a tribunal's decision only if a full statement of the tribunal's decision was requested or provided and a summary of grounds in a decision notice could not be challenged for inadequacy (paragraphs 6 and 7);
2.	a tribunal's decision would not be erroneous in point of law for breach of the chairman's duty to provide a full statement on a request made within 21 days if the decision notice in fact contained an adequate statement of reasons (paragraph 8);
3.	where there was no full statement of reasons a tribunal might be shown to have erred in law if the point of law was justiciable without there being evidence of the tribunal's reasoning or if sufficient evidence of their reasoning could be gleaned from the decision notice (paragraph 9);
4.	a chairman had no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal if no full statement had been issued but a Commissioner could grant leave if there were special reasons for doing so notwithstanding a failure to apply to a chairman within the specified time and could waive the requirement that a full statement be annexed to an application and, accordingly, had jurisdiction to hear an appeal even though no full statement had been issued (paragraphs 14 to 17);
5.	a tribunal had a duty to ensure that all relevant questions had been asked of a claimant but were not bound to ask questions that had already been asked by the Secretary of State or an adjudication officer (paragraph 31);
6.	the tribunal in CIS/3299/1997 had been unable to ask material questions relating to regulation 6(a) but fairness had not required an adjournment because the claimant had not been wholly unaware that the extent of his ability to work was relevant, the tribunal were entitled to take the view that the claimant would have been unlikely to succeed on that issue and the claimant had chosen not to appear before the tribunal (paragraph 32);
7.	the inquisitorial role of the tribunal required them to draw the claimant's attention in their reasons to the material point previously overlooked by the adjudication officer, the decision notice in CIS/3299/1997 did not do so and, as the claimant's application for leave to appeal had again referred to the extent of his ability to work, it should have been regarded as a request for a full statement made within 21 days and the tribunal's decision was erroneous in point of law because no such statement had been provided (paragraphs 36 to 38);
8.	the tribunal in CIB/4189/1997 had not been obliged to ask the claimant about an activity with which she had previously told the Benefits Agency she had no difficulties and had not failed to ask her about other activities (paragraph 41);
9.	there was no reason why the chairman in CIB/4189/1997 should have issued a full statement and in the absence of one the tribunal's decision could not be impugned for inadequacy of reasons (paragraphs 40 and 42).",1,60,285,,

(disagreeing with the reasoning in para. 9(2) of CA/84/1984) conclusion that the condition was not serious cannot reasonably be drawn from the evidence that the medical advisors were aware of the condition and had not arranged in-patient care, without seeking to know why they had arranged it. The DMP exercises an inquisitorial jurisdiction and has a duty to inquire into all the relevant facts before reaching a conclusion. The attendance allowance board seeks a report from the claimants medical advisor. In such circumstances it is not reasonable to infer that the medical advisors have not recommended his in-patient supervision because they do not regard his condition as serious, without putting the question to them. They may be other reasons for not putting him in hospital  for example it may be desirable in the claimants interest to keep him at home and in the community (para. 8);
2.	(distinguishing CA/84/1984) the medical advisor here actually put forward facts which suggests the reason why the claimant was not confined in a hospital. He stated that he managed to enable her to live at home by keeping her dose of Modecate low and by her family coping with her occasional difficult behaviour in relation to her irrational fears. The clear inference from this evidence is that the claimants condition could be dealt with at home by the use of medication and supervision (para. 9);
3.	the claimants case was decided on the basis of an imputed motive to the consultant which he was not asked about and which the claimant was given no opportunity of rebutting, that was contrary to the rules of natural justice (para. 9).",1,98,275,,

The claimant suffered from severe Chron's disease. He had no day time attention or supervision needs. For twelve hours each night, he required to use certain equipment for intravenous total parenteral nutrition. His mother, with whom he lived, was trained to use the equipment as a precautionary measure. The Delegated Medical Practitioner decided that the claimant did not require attention at night. The Delegated Medical Practitioner also decided that the test for night time supervision contained in section 35(1)(b) of the Social Security Act 1975, as mentioned with effect from 15 March 1988 by section 1(2) of the Social Security Act 1988, was not satisfied. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:	
1.	the amendment to section 35 of  the Social Security Act 1975 by section 1(2) of the Social Security Act 1988 was expressed to apply a different and more stringent legal test both to new claims and to any review of a past decision. In each case the amendment would necessarily have some retrospective effect (para. 11);
2.	the amended legislation resulted from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Moran v. Secretary of State for Social Services (appendix to R(A) 1/88). The application of the amended night time supervision test to the review of the previous decision in the period prior to 15 March 1988 brought the amendment within the definitions of retrospective legislation contained in the advice of the Privy Council in the Yew Bon Tew v. Kenderaan Bas Mara [1983] AC 553;
3.	for the reasons given in paragraphs 13 and 14 the presumption against retrospective legislation was overcome.",1,99,,,

On 16 December 1988 Delegated Medical Practitioner maintained an earlier decision rejecting the claim for attendance allowance. The claimant had died on 21 January 1988. His wife had been acting on his behalf prior to his death. She had not been appointed to act for him under regulation 30 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. She was appointed administratrix to the estate of the deceased claimant on 9 April 1990

Held that:
neither the application for a review of earlier delegated medical practitioners decision nor an appeal to the Commissioner is to be regarded as analogous to actions in Court. The said regulation 30 headed payments on death is not exclusive but merely provides one mode by which matters may be proceeded with. Provided the Secretary of State gets a good receipt for any payment of benefit that may be made (as undoubtedly he would if the money were paid to an administrator under a Grant of Letters of Administration) then no problem exists. There is no reason why the doctrine of relation back already propounded by the Courts in cases of Grants of Letters of Administration should not apply to Social Security cases. The rules as to the issuing of writs to institute actions in Courts are of necessity strict and technical. They should not be applied to Social Security matters (para. 11).

The claimant was given to violent and irresponsible behaviour and the evidence showed that he committed criminal acts, both of violence and dishonesty. The Attendance Allowance Board found that he was not suffering from a severe physical or mental disability and that his anti-social behaviour arose from a personality disorder and they could find no medical evidence of severe mental disability.  The members of the Board directed themselves that before they could issue a certificate of attendance needs, they must be satisfied that the claimant had relevant attention or supervision needs which arose from a severe mental or physical disability. The claimant appealed against that decision and his appeal was dismissed.

Held that:
1.	the phrase severely disabled physically or mentally relates to a condition of body or mind that can be defined medically and that it is not meant to encompass unsociable behaviour which is not related to serious mental illness;

The claimant suffered schizophrenia and was at risk of committing suicide. The delegated medical practitioner gave two reasons for not accepting that the claimant required continual supervision throughout the day in order to avoid substantial danger to himself. First, if the claimants doctors thought there was a danger of suicide the claimant would be detained as an in-patient; and secondly, no amount of supervision would prevent a determined suicide attempt.

Held that:
1.	it was not reasonable for the delegated medical practitioner to infer that the claimant was not a danger just because he had not been made an in-patient;
2.	contrary to the view of the Commissioner in CA/149/1990, the Attendance Allowance Board or the delegated medical practitioner has to find out whether continual supervision is required in order to effect a real reduction in risk of harm to the claimant, not in order to eliminate all substantial danger",1,98,,,

The claimant suffered from blackouts, epilepsy and narcolepsy. He applied for attendance allowance on 27 September 1985.

The claimant applied to the Attendance Allowance Board for a review of this decision. On 17 February 1988, the Board reviewed, but did not revise the decision, holding that, because of the absence of warning, any risk of blackout could not be avoided by supervision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
the lack of warning in cases of epileptic attacks was not cause enough to refuse benefit. If another persons presence was sufficient to reduce the amount of danger involved when a sudden attack occurred, then that may be sufficient to comply with the relevant conditions of entitlement.

The claimant had been receiving attendance allowance since 1987. He took up residence in the Canary Islands on 23 September 1988. The adjudication officer reviewed the decision awarding attendance allowance and decided that claimant did not satisfy the residence and presence conditions contained in regulation 2 of the Attendance Allowance (No. 2) Regulations. An appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision that the claimant was not entitled to attendance allowance from and including 26 September 1988. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

In allowing the claimants appeal the Commissioner held that:
1.	the principles enunciated by the European Court of Justice in the case of Roger Stanton Newton and the Chief Adjudication Officer [C 356/89] apply to the payment of attendance allowance (para. 6); 
2.	in the case of any person who has been an employed worker in the United Kingdom          and has acquired the right to an invalidity benefit from the United Kingdom, the residence and presence conditions contained in regulation 2 of the Attendance Allowance (No. 2) Regulations 1975 do not prevent the continued payment of that benefit by reason only of his transfer of residence to another Member State (para. 6).",1,246,119,,

The claimant, the grandmother of the child, made a claim for child benefit following the making of a supervision requirement by a childrens hearing which contained a residence condition requiring the child to reside with the claimant and her husband. The claimant appealed against the decision of a tribunal upholding the decision of an adjudication officer that the claimant was precluded from child benefit by regulation 16(5)(b) of the Child Benefit (General) regulations 1976 because the child was boarded-out under the Boarding-out and Fostering of Children (Scotland) regulations 1985.

Held that (part B of the appendix to the decision):
1.	in order to constitute boarding-out of a child in care by the local authority within the meaning of regulation 16(5)(b) of the Child Benefit (General) Regulations the action taken must not only be in accordance with the Boarding out and Fostering of Children (Scotland) Regulations 1985 (the BOFC Regulations) but also be identifiable as boarding-out under the statutory authority in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (the 1968 Act) (para. 7);
2.	placement of a foster child under Part III of the BOFC Regulation, which may occur when a provision of regulations 3(1)(a) to (e) applies is to be distinguished from the placement of a child under Part IV where regulation 3(1)(f) applies. Placement under Part III involves detailed procedures including the approval of foster parents and financial and other agreements. Such action will be in the case of a local authority, having a child in care, represent boarding-out under section 21 and will be boarding-out under the BOFC Regulations (para. 12);
3.	by contrast placement under Part IV does not normally involve approved foster parents at all. There is no question of the grandmother concerned being an approved foster parent and no question of agreements on financial and other matters.

Regulation 11(1) of the Child Benefit (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1984 provided that the right to payment of benefit shall be extinguished if inter alia payment is not received within twelve months of the date of the instrument of payment if one has been sent or in certain cases such date as the Secretary of State determines. Regulation 11(2) provided that where a question has arisen as to whether extinguishment has occurred, extinguishment will not take place where the claimant, having given written notice after the expiration of twelve months requesting payment of the benefit, had good cause for not giving that notice throughout the relevant period. In that event the period for seeking payment would be extended to the date of determination of the question. Regulation 38 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 replaced regulation 11. Regulation 38 contained no provision for the extension of the twelve month period for good cause. The claimant, who suffered from depression, failed to give written notice requesting payment of the benefit until after expiry of twelve months from the date the sums were payable and after regulation 38 replaced regulation 11. She did however telephone asking for the arrears before regulation 38 was introduced.

Held that:

The adjudication officer in awarding family credit did not allow amounts shown in the accounts for depreciation, bad debts, lunches, private motoring expenses and the private use of the telephone. The claimant appealed against the decision. In his submission to the tribunal the adjudication officer said that since the claimant and her husband had taken two weeks holiday during the period of the accounts, the calculation of earnings should have been based on a fifty week assessment period. The tribunal, in allowing the appeal, directed that the award of family credit be recalculated to allow as expenses bad debts, lunches, private use of the telephone and private motoring expenses.

Held that:
1.	expenses that could be apportioned were motoring expenses including road fund licence, insurance and repairs and maintenance, and telephone expenses including rental charges. (Insofar as the Adjudication Officers Guide was inconsistent it was not to be followed R(SB) 28/84 cited).

In the week of the claim she had worked for 15 hours and for the previous two weeks, 20 hours in each. She received five hours holiday pay in the first of the three weeks.

The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the grounds that the claimant did not satisfy regulation 5(1) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 in that she did not carry out activities in the course of her work for nor less than 24 hours in any of the relevant three weeks.

The tribunal, in allowing her appeal, held that as she had worked 20 hours and was paid a further five hours holiday pay in one of the relevant weeks, she had been engaged in remunerative work for more than 24 hours in that week and therefore satisfied regulation 5(1) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987.

The adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
regulations 4 and 5 of the Family Credit (General) Regulations must be taken together in order to allow regulation 4(3) to operate in relation to both (para. 3) A claimant may be treated as engaged in remunerative work, by including hours during which he is absent from work by reason of a recognised, customary or other holiday, to make up the requisite number of hours.

Although her contract was for 22½ hours a week she worked more than 24 hours a week because of the nature of her work. The adjudication officer decided that she was not entitled to family credit because she was unable to satisfy the requirements of regulation 4(1) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 because she was not engaged in work for not less than 24 hours a week, being work for which payment was made or which was done in expectation of payment. The claimant disputed this decision, but the adjudication officer refused to review his original decision. The claimants appeal was taken to be against the adjudication officers refusal to review. The tribunal unanimously decided that the claimant was not entitled to family credit because she was only working 22 hours a week in expectation of payment.

Held that:
1.	the decision of the social security appeal tribunal was erroneous in point of law and is set aside (para. 1);
2.	the Commissioner had jurisdiction to deal with the initial decision refusing family credit (para. 3);
3.	it is necessary to consider both regulation 4 and regulation 5 of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 together, and failure to do so is an error of law (paras. 7 and 8);
4.	whether a person satisfies the conditions of regulations 4 and/or 5 of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 is a question of fact determined by examining all the evidence. No one factor, such as the hours of work specified in the contract of employment, is paramount or decisive. In some occupations, such as those connected with the caring professions (for example, teaching or the health service), the necessity to work over and above contractual hours is an integral part of the job. It will have to be considered in the particular circumstances of each case what time is necessarily spent carrying out activities in the course of the work in question (para. 12);

The claimants husband was in receipt of invalidity benefit including a dependency increase of the claimant. She worked part-time and her earnings were within the limit for such an increase. She then gave up work to look after her father. She claimed invalid care allowance. Under regulation 10 of the Overlapping Benefit Regulations the dependency increase fell to be adjusted, and arrears of invalid care allowance payable to her were reduced by the amount of the increase of invalidity benefit already paid to her husband. The Commissioner held that the application of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations gave rise to indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex but that this was objectively justifiable and not in breach of Article 4(1) of EEC Directive 79/7.

On 7 March 1991, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the claimant and held that:

She made a late claim for widowed mother's allowance, which was awarded from 14 February 1984 with appropriate additions for the children. After both children had left her address, she continued to receive widowed mother's allowance although, as she no longer had a child under the age of 19 living with her, her entitlement thereto had ceased. As she had failed to disclose the change in circumstances that had brought such entitlement to a close the social security appeal tribunal decided there had been an overpayment recoverable under section 53 of the Social Security Act 1986.

Held:
1.	(by the Commissioner) that the resulting overpayment having arisen prior to 6 April 1987, when section 53 of the Social Security Act 1986 came into force, the appeal tribunal had erred in law in applying that section, rather than section 119 of the Social Security Act 1975, to the question of whether or not repayment was required of the claimant of the amount overpaid to her. When the claimant received the overpayment, the law told her she must use due care and diligence to avoid overpayment.

He was paid a flat-rate travelling allowance to compensate for the extra travel between his home and the detached duty location. Some six months after redeployment he was involved in a road traffic accident on his way home from work approximately ten minutes after he had finished work for the day. The claimant made an application for a declaration that the accident was an industrial accident under section 107 of the Social Security Act 1975.

2.	however, the claimant had been encouraged in the view that his diagnosis was not at risk as the Secretary of State had accepted that he suffered from the prescribed disease;

The claimant suffered injuries arising out of three separate industrial accidents over a period of three years. He claimed disablement benefit in relation to all three accidents. A medical board made a net final assessment of the disablement arising from the first accident of 4% from 18 July 1984 to 17 July 1985 after offsetting 3% for a previous back condition. There was a final assessment of 4% from 1 June 1986 to 30 November 1986 in relation to the second accident. And in relation to the third accident there was a final assessment of 2% from 27 May 1986 to 30 November 1986 after offsetting 4% in respect of the previous injury to the claimants left knee. The claimant appealed to the tribunal against all three decisions. In each case, the tribunal confirmed the decision of the medical board. The claimant then appealed to the Commissioner. The question of assessing disablement when the disability results not only from an industrial accident but other causes arose.

Held that:
1.	regulation 11 of the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982 provides for assessing disablement when the disabilities results from the relevant industrial accident and another cause. Para. (3) enables an assessment to be made of the disability arising from the relevant accident looked at in isolation and the interaction of that accident on the other effective cause where the latter precedes the accident; 
2.	regulation 11(4) applies where the other effective cause occurs after the industrial accident in question. In such cases the assessment is limited to the disablement resulting from the industrial accident unless that assessment is 11% or more. If the assessment from the industrial accident is 11% or more then the assessment has to take account of any disablement resulting from the other effective cause except to the extent to which the claimant would have been subject to if the relevant accident had not occurred;
3.	regulation 11(5) applies where the disablement arises from two or more industrial accidents or diseases. In paragraphs (3) and (4) the other effective cause need not be industrial. Paragraph (5) provides that where there has been more than one industrial accident or disease, and some degree of disability, over and above that attributable to the last industrial accident or disease, looked at in isolation, arises from the interaction of that industrial accident or disease on the claimants existing condition, the degree of disability shall be attributed to that last industrial accident or disease. Any assessment awarded in respect of any earlier industrial accident or disease will remain undisturbed;

Claimant claimed industrial disablement benefit for prescribed industrial disease C23.

The Medical Board decided the claimant was not suffering from prescribed disease C23 or any sequela of that disease. The adjudicating officer decided disablement benefit was not payable. The claimant appealed to the Medical Appeal Tribunal. The Medical Boards decision was upheld, and in reaching their decision, the Medical Appeal Tribunal considered whether the claimant could only be suffering from prescribed disease C23 if he had been engaged in an occupation involving exposure to substances listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 23 of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985.

Held that:

Directions to medical appeal tribunal on referral - Section 112(6) and (7) of Social Security Act 1975.

Claimant suffered an industrial accident and injured his knee. Various assessments and reviews took place. A final assessment of 3% from 20 June 1975 to 20 June 1976 was made by a reassessment medical board on 9 May 1975. On 26 January 1988 the claimant applied for a review on the grounds that there had been an unforeseen aggravation. On 4 March 1988 an adjudicating medical authority decided there had been no unforeseen aggravation. The claimant appealed. On 17 November 1988 the medical appeal tribunal made the following assessment:
(1)	From 20 June 1976 to 19 June 1986 award 8% provisional.
(2)	From 19 June 1986 to 11 January 1988 10% provisional.
(3)	From 12 January 1988 to 11 July 1988 20% provisional.
(4)	From 12 July 1988 10% for life final.
The medical appeal tribunal had no jurisdiction to backdate the assessment prior to 26 October 1987 since the period to be taken into account by any assessment reviewed and revised under section 110(2) of the Social Security Act 1975 was a period not exceeding three months before the date of the application: section 110(5) of the Act of 1975 and regulation 68(a) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986.
Some six months out of time, the Secretary of State on 22 August 1989 gave notice of application for leave to appeal. The reason given for the delay in the application was the need to seek advice from the statutory adjudicating authorities and from solicitors as to whether the MAT decision could be implemented. Extensive inquiries were made before issuing the application. The main ground for appeal was that the MATs decision was erroneous and, if it was allowed to stand, it provided for assessment from 20 June 1976 until 25 October 1987, a period where there was no entitlement under the statute and regulations.
Section 112(6) of the Act of 1975 now provides that where the Commissioner holds that a decision of an MAT was erroneous in law he shall set it aside and refer the case to an MAT with directions for its determination and section 112(7) now provides that Subject to any direction by the Commissioner, the MAT shall consist of persons who were not members of the MAT which gave the erroneous decision.

Held:
l.	the question for determination was whether or not there were special reasons for an extension of time in the particular case: Regulation 3(2) of the Social Security Commissioners Procedure Regulations 1987. The reasons given for lateness by the Secretary of State in his notice for leave to appeal would not of themselves have been sufficient, but taking into account the clear error in the MATs decision it was proper to extend the time. The Commissioner is not limited to the consideration of special reasons relating to the delay which has taken place: R v.

 2.	the case was referred to a MAT with direction that it should comprise the same members who made the decision appealed against and that they should delete the assessments from 20 June 1976 to 19 June 1986 and from 19 June 1986 to 25 October 1987 and make the remaining assessments as in the decision appealed against;

The claimant applied for declarations that on six separate occasions between 7 May 1982 and 31 December 1986 she had suffered an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment. The basis of her applications, each one of which was fully documented, was that on each of these occasions she was, by the nature of her work, obliged to inhale smoke arising from fellow workers cigarettes. On appeal a social security appeal tribunal confirmed the decision of the adjudication officer refusing to give an industrial accident declaration in each case. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.

Held that:

He contended that during the five years prior to the date of claim he had used powered grinding tools on cast metal. On appeal the social security appeal tribunal confirmed the decision of the adjudication officer by rejecting that contention and instead found that the claimant had not been engaged in an occupation prescribed in relation to occupational deafness within five years prior to the date the claim to disablement benefit was made. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	regulation 25(2) of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985 which disentitle a claimant to disablement benefit where the claim is made more than five years after the date when the claimant had ceased to be engaged in a prescribed occupation was declared ultra vires by the Court of Appeal on 26 October 1989.

The claimant was continuously in receipt of supplementary benefit and income support from October 1986 until October 1988 when he ceased to claim on receipt of £8,400 from his former landlord by way of a settlement of a claim for damages for unlawful eviction. In January 1989 when he claimed income support again, having spent the money, the adjudication officer decided that under regulation 51(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 he was treated as possessing £7,034.90 of which he had deprived himself for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support. The appeal tribunal upheld the decision but reduced the amount of notional capital to £6,214 by deducting certain expenditure. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the primary ground that regulation 51 (1) was ultra vires the empowering legislation on grounds of unreasonableness in that it introduced a mandatory and permanent requirement incapable of modification by any diminishing capital rule. 

The tribunal of Commissioners held that:
1.	the application of a rule analogous to the diminishing capital rule arises from the provision of regulation 51(6) that notional capital must be calculated as if it is actual capital which the claimant does possess (para. 16);
2.	the argument that regulation 51(1) of the 1987 Regulations is ultra vires as being unreasonable in its effect or irrational cannot therefore be sustained (para. 18);
3.	in applying regulation 51(1) the existing case law in Commissioners' decisions R(SB) 38/85 and 40/85 on the meaning of deprive himself for the purpose of securing entitlement to (benefit) or increasing the amount of that benefit in regulation 4(1) of the Supplementary Benefit (Resources) Regulations still applies (para. 22);

The claimant is a married man who suffered permanent brain damage in an accident. Supplementary benefit was in payment from November 1970 to September 1981; invalidity benefit (IVB) was then awarded and entitlement to supplementary benefit ceased (the invalidity benefit trap.) The claimants wife, who in practice did virtually everything for the claimant, formed the view that any person in receipt of IVB could not also qualify for supplementary benefit. The legislation was changed in November 1983, removing the preventive effect, but the claimants wife did not become aware of the change.
The claimants wife applied on 21 January 1988 to be appointed by the Secretary of State to exercise on her husbands behalf any rights he might have under certain Acts as specified on the application form. Supplementary benefit was not in payment at the time, nor, due to the wifes misunderstanding, was a claim to that benefit in contemplation.
A claim to income support was made on 20 October 1988 by the claimants solicitor and following an award from that date a claim to have the award backdated to 11 April 1988 was made, also by the solicitor, on 31 January 1989. The adjudication officer refused to backdate on the ground that continuous good cause for delay had not been shown by the wife in her capacity as the claimants appointee.

Held that:

Payment of income support was suspended and the claimant was advised that he could not be paid full income support because the question of his availability and entitlement had still to be decided by an adjudication officer.

The claimant, a nurse who worked on North Sea oil rigs from time to time, interspersed with periods of unemployment, had been in receipt of income support. He complained that some awards of benefit had not been paid to him by the Secretary of State because income support giros had not reached him. The adjudication officer decided that it is for the Secretary of State to decide whether an instrument of payment should be issued or replaced. The tribunal, upholding the adjudication officer's decision, decided they had no jurisdiction to determine whether instruments of payment had been received by the claimant. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. the adjudication officer, the social security appeal tribunal and the Commissioner are statutory authorities, deriving their jurisdiction in relation to income support from section 52(3) of the Social Security Act 1986. In consequence, section 98 of the Social Security Act 1975 provides for any claim for benefit, and any question arising in connection with a claim or award, to be submitted to an adjudication officer, for determination. A right of appeal follows, under section 100 (para. 12);
2. an award of benefit, whilst not defined in Social Security Acts, is simply a decision that benefit is payable. Failure to implement an award of benefit is not a question connected with the question whether it is payable; it relates to the Secretary of State's obligation to give effect to decisions of the statutory authority (para. 14);
3. in the absence of clear words in legislation to remove the right of any person to have his complaint against the Secretary of State heard in the Courts, then that right remains.

The mortgage interest on the claimants home had been allowed in full for sometime in the assessment of income support. In November 1989 the adjudication officer decided that as the house was located in a more expensive area than other areas in which suitable alternative accommodation existed, it was reasonable to expect the claimant to obtain alternative accommodation and that the housing costs were excessive. In restricting the housing costs to nil the adjudication officer concluded that with the money available from the sale of her present home the claimant would be in a position to purchase a suitable alternative property in the area without recourse to a mortgage. On appeal the tribunal upheld the decision of the adjudication officer. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1. in applying paragraphs 10(3) and (4) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 the test is a subjective one in which the comparison of housing costs lies between those of the existing property and those of the appropriate suitable alternative accommodation. Where the housing costs of the latter amount to nil the claimant is not entitled to housing costs. In so concluding the Commissioner followed the reasoning of the Commissioner in decision R(SB) 6/87 on a like provision in the former supplementary benefit scheme (para. 18);
2. paragraph 11 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations, as referred to in paragraph 10(3) of that Schedule, has no relevance where the housing costs of the suitable alternative accommodation are nil (para. 19).",1,174,,,

On her claim for income support the adjudication officer refused to deduct her child minding expenses from her income when calculating her entitlement.

Held that: 
1.	the rate of income support was a social security matter to which Directive 76/207 did not apply; 
2.	income support was part of a statutory scheme which did not provide protection against any of the risks set out to Article 3 of Directive 79/7; it provided against the risk of poverty.

A claim for funeral expenses was made which included the cost of transporting the deceased from Cheltenham (England) to Wishaw (Scotland). Although the deceased had lived in Cheltenham with his wife and child for nine years he had originated from Wishaw and his widow arranged for him to be buried there.
The adjudication officer disallowed the expenses for transportation to Wishaw on the grounds that the deceaseds home within the meaning of regulation 7(2)(g) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 had been in Cheltenham. The claimant appealed and the AOs decision was overturned. The appeal tribunal held that the deceaseds home was a place more intimately connected with him and to which he may return. They awarded payment for the transportation costs which the local office paid.

The AO appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1. there is no definition of the word home in the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (Regulations) 1987. However, the Supplementary Benefit (Single Payment) Regulations 1981 which preceded them did define home and the meaning of the phrase the deceaseds home (para. 5);

The claimant was an elderly lady suffering from mental illness. She had been living in a residential care home, where she received benefit at the residential care rate.

A central establishment (the core) administered the project and operated as a residential care home, and small houses (the cluster) were situated in the vicinity. The aim of the project was to provide suitable rehabilitation and care at the core home and then to transfer as many as possible of the residents to one of the cluster houses, where they were encouraged in independent living with a view to eventual rehabilitation into the general community. Only the care home was registered under Part 1 of the Registered Homes Act 1984.

The claimant contended that the payment should be considered as an eligible service charge. The tribunal found that the insurance premium could not be treated as a service charge in the terms of paragraphs 1(f) and 1(h) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner who allowed the appeal and remitted the case to an adjudication officer to ascertain whether housing benefit could be paid in respect of the insurance premium.

Held that:
1.	the obligation, contained in the lease, on the landlord to use the insurance monies for reinstatement or rebuilding means that these insurance charges are undoubtedly connected with the provision of adequate accommodation (paras. 14 and 15);

The claimant was in receipt of supplementary benefit, and subsequently income support, from 3 July 1985 calculated on the basis that she had no income. Her entitlement to supplementary benefit included an amount in respect of an additional requirement for heating at the lower rate on accommodation grounds. In February 1989 it was established that she had commenced part-time working in July 1987. The adjudication officer subsequently determined that she had been overpaid £433.60 over the period 24 July 1987 to 10 February 1989 and that this sum was recoverable from her because she had failed to disclose her earnings from this employment. On appeal it was argued that the amount recoverable should be reduced by a claimed underpayment of an additional requirement for heating at the higher rate in the claimant's supplementary benefit assessment. The tribunal concluded that the lower rate heating addition already in payment was appropriate from 24 July 1987 and confirmed the adjudication officer's decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	as a local councillor the claimant was an employed person within the meaning of regulation 2 of the Income Support (General) Regulations. The word employed looked at in isolation from the phrase employed earner must in accordance with the glossary of expressions in Schedule 20 of the Social Security Act 1975, be construed in accordance with employment below and the term employment is defined there as including any trade, business or profession, office or vocation. The holding of an office is clearly an employment and as the claimant received payment by virtue of this office he was gainfully employed in such employment (para. 5);
2.	payments for travelling expenses and subsistence allowance could only have been made under Section 174(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 where they had to be necessarily incurred 
. . for the purpose of enabling him to perform any approved duty. They were payments in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in performance of the duties of the employment within regulation 35(l)(f) and 35(2)(c) of the regulations and are not to be treated as part of the claimants earnings (CIS/89/1989 affirmed) (para. 8);
3.	expenses in relation to the claimants need to purchase note paper and stationery and the cost of telephone calls are undoubtedly expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his office, but the local authority made no payment in respect of them. Therefore there is nothing to disregard under regulation 35. The language of that regulation is severely restrictive. In contrast the language employed in regulation 2 of the Social Security (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1978 clearly allows deduction of all expenses reasonably incurred from earnings of any kind received by the claimant from this employment or office (R(U) 5/83 distinguished) (para. 8).

The claimant had been an executive director in his familys company. On resigning his office he received compensation of £50,000 plus a fixed-term loan of £50,000. He held shares in the company, some of which he sold using the proceeds to pay debts and reduce his mortgage. The remaining shares were subject to an agreement whereby the claimant undertook not to sell them, save in specific circumstances, nor pledge them as security. The company agreed to release him from restriction, after a specified date, in respect of 3,000 of the shares which could be used to secure a loan not exceeding £50,000.

The adjudication officer obtained a valuation of the shares from the companys accountants. Based on the net value of the company the shares were worth in excess of £196,000 but it was stated that the shares were not marketable because of a pre-emptive agreement. The adjudication officer nevertheless decided that the claimant had capital in excess of the prescribed limit of £8,000. On appeal the tribunal confirmed the adjudication officers disallowance of benefit but on different grounds: they held that the loan of £50,000 received from the company was not capital and that the shares owned by the claimant had a nil value except for the 3,000 released from restriction, which were worth in excess of £8,000. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. the question whether the claimant is in a position analogous to that of a partner for the purpose of reg. 51(4) of the IS (Gen) regs. 1987 is not defined and is a question of fact in each individual case. However, some broad principles apply:
(a) it is not enough to say that the criterion is whether or not the claimant participates in the business. A claimant may be a partner even when he is not undertaking activities in the course of the business (para. 8);
(b) partnerships are normally fairly small concerns involving a limited number of personnel (para. 9);
(c) for a claimant with shares in a limited company to be treated as being analogous to a partner he should be in a position to exercise significant influence over the way in which the business is conducted. A shareholder in a company who is not in such a position and who has no direct or indirect participation in the trading activities of the business is purely an investor (paras. 8 and 9);
2. a claimants shares in a company, even those subject to a pre-emptive rights provision, do have a value and this should be calculated in accordance with reg. 49 of the IS(Gen) Regs. 1987. Any incumbrance can be deducted from the value of the shares. Any pre-emptive rights provisions fall to be considered under the principles laid down in IRC v. Crossman, IRC v. Mann (1937) AC 26. The value of the shares should be estimated at the price they would fetch if sold on the open market, subject to the Articles of Association, including the pre-emptive rights provision, and the terms of any resignation agreement (para. 11);
3. the fixed term loan of £50,000 was capital freely available to the claimant, notwithstanding that he was obliged to repay it after the stated term. R(SB) 14/81 affirmed; R(SB) 12/86 distinguished (para. 15).",1,28,29,,

The claimant sold a property on 18 December 1989 and received £19,000 proceeds. He made payments to his three sons totalling £13,756 in respect of alleged debts owed to them. The adjudication officer found that the claimant had, in fact, deprived himself of this sum for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support and that he should therefore be treated as possessing notional capital of £13,765 in accordance with regulation 51(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. On appeal the tribunal upheld the decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	from 1 October 1990 the formula in regulation 51A of the Income Support (General) Regulations applied to the calculation of notional capital and superseded the principles laid down in R(IS) 1/91 (para. 11);
2.	bearing in mind that the claimant had declared that he had £4,000 actual capital, and the amount of notional capital was £13,756, the interval between the date of deprivation and the date of claim was so short that it was clear that the diminishing notional capital rule would not have reduced the claimants capital below the statutory limit. It was therefore unnecessary for the tribunal to go into this matter (para. 8);
3.	it was equally clear that the claimants resources could not have fallen below the statutory limit by the date of the tribunal hearing; although it might have been helpful if it had done so, there was no obligation on the tribunal to point out that a time would come when the claimants resources fell below the crucial figure.

The AO refused to review those decisions because the claimant had not established any grounds for review. The relevant documents had been destroyed in accordance with normal departmental procedures. The claimant appealed to a tribunal against the adjudication officers refusal to review. At the tribunal hearing the claimants representative argued that the legal principle applied in The Ophelia [1915] P 129 and [1916] 2 AC 206 omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem (every presumption is made against a wrong-doer) established that the destroyed documents must be presumed to support his case. The tribunal rejected this argument and upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the missing documents relating to the decisions to be reviewed were not destroyed with any improper motive (para. 26);
2.	there is a clear distinction to be drawn between the deliberate destruction of documents with the intention of destroying evidence and deliberate destruction where there is no such intention. Adverse presumptions can only be drawn where the documents were destroyed with the intention of destroying evidence (in this respect The Ophelia is still good law); otherwise the only detriment suffered by the destroying party is a loss of corroboration that the documents might have afforded him (para. 30 and appendix 3);
3.	the suggestion by the Commissioner in the unreported decision CSB/1288/1985 that the principle applied in The Ophelia could apply to the routine destruction of documents which it was impracticable to retain, was erroneous (para. 36);
4.	in the SS jurisdiction no presumptions as to the contents of documents can be drawn where the Department has routinely destroyed them with the intention of clearing storage space or because there appears to be no point in retaining such documents (para. 38 and appendix 3);
5.	adjudicating authorities should take account of all available evidence, including secondary evidence, and decide on the balance of probabilities what the original document might have contained.

The claimant purchased the dwelling occupied as the home in July 1989, whilst self employed, with a mortgage of £630,000. The dwelling consisted of a flat and a garden studio used by the claimant for his work. He claimed income support on 7 June 1990 as his business had failed. He had made only two payments on the mortgage between July 1989 and June 1990.

The tribunal found that any restriction to the housing costs should be implemented immediately under paragraph 10(6) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as the claimant could not afford the financial commitment when it was entered into. The Commissioner (in decision on file No. CIS/542/1990) decided that the dwelling was situated in a more expensive area than other areas in which suitable alternative accommodation existed and that housing costs would fall to be restricted.

The Commissioner further decided, having seen and heard the claimant, that at the time he entered into the mortgage he was in a position to meet his financial obligation and genuinely believed that he would continue to be able to do so. Accordingly the claimants housing costs were not to be restricted for a period of six months from 7 June 1990.

On 2 April 1992 the Court of Appeal (Purchas and Mann LJJ and Sir Michael Kerr) dismissed an appeal by the Secretary of State and held that:
1. the correct test under regulation 10(6) was whether the claimant at the time he took out the mortgage had the ability to meet the continuing commitment under that mortgage for the reasonably foreseeable future;
2. the Commissioner had found as a question of fact that the claimant had the requisite ability to pay at the material time and his decision was not open to challenge.",1,174,,,

The claimant applied for a social fund payment to meet the funeral expenses of her partner. The funeral, conducted by the Burial Society of the United Synagogue, cost £1,325. The Society were not able to itemise the bill. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to a social fund payment to meet the funeral expenses because the claimant could not provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved. The Burial Society confirmed that they undertook all funeral arrangements for its members and that those arrangements consisted of a basic funeral according to Orthodox Jewish rite. The adjudication officer concluded that there were no grounds to change his decision. On appeal the tribunal decided that they would allow £800 for the costs of the funeral plus £75 for the requirements of a religious faith. The figure of £800 was based on the Departments guide as the top limit of the average cost of a funeral. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	in determining whether the funeral payment fell within regulation 7(2) of the Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations the tribunal should not have taken an average figure for funerals as the basic measure of comparison. They had to decide whether the cost of items to which the funeral in question gave rise were expenses allowable under the regulation (para. 9);
2.	as such funeral payments are drawn from public funds there must be a restriction on costs and even where the word reasonable is not employed it should be implied (para. 10);
3.	a Jewish funeral is simple in nature with only one class of funeral for every deceased Jew. Therefore on the balance of probabilities the figure of £1,325 is reasonable for such a funeral. The elements that go to make up a Jewish funeral fall within regulation 7(2) (para. 11);
4.	the words additional expenses refer to expenses over and above the items set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) of regulation 7(2) and not to the enhanced costs within those sub-paragraphs occasioned by the Jewish faith of the deceased (para. 13);
5.	refreshments were not an additional expense arising out of the religious faith of the deceased (para. 14);
6.	the gratuities shown in regulation 7(2)(e) refer to those paid out by the undertaker and not by any other party. Only those gratuities dispersed by the undertaker can be included in the claim (para. 15).",1,9,,,

The claimant had been awarded mobility allowance. That award was due to expire on 16 October 1987. He made a renewal claim. A medical appeal tribunal in a decision dated 11 May 1988 confirmed the decision of the medical board that the claimant did not satisfy the medical conditions for an award of mobility allowance. The tribunal had found that although the claimant walked with a marked limp he was able to make steady progress without apparent pain or stress. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner conceding that he could walk reasonably well on the level but not up inclines. The Commissioner considered the meaning of unable or virtually unable to walk.

Held that:
1. agreeing with what was said in R(M) 1/78, the meaning of virtually unable to walk is a question of law;
2. extending what was said in R(M) 3/78 at paragraph 12, the base point was a total inability to walk, which can be extended to take in people who can technically walk but only to an insignificant extent;
3. an inability or virtual inability to walk cannot merely be established by an inability to walk to the shops or to a bus stop and so carry on a normal life (see R(M) 3/78 at para. 9);
4. it was clear from the wording of regulation 3(1)(b) of the Mobility Allowance Regulations that a claimants ability to walk had to be assessed by reference to his ability to walk out of doors and the test should select or envisage the kind of pavement or road which is normally to be found in the course of walking out of doors. The ability or otherwise to surmount hills or mountains was not relevant to the question of inability to walk. However, the tribunal must envisage a reasonable outdoor track which will not be entirely level.",1,91,,,

The claimant, a United Kingdom national, was working in France as a self-employed person when he was injured, as a result becoming a tetraplegic.  He returned to the United Kingdom and was awarded a mobility allowance.  Subsequently, he went to live permanently in France.  The adjudication officer determined that his entitlement to mobility allowance had ended because he no longer met the conditions as to residence and presence in Great Britain laid down in section 37A(1) of the Social Security Act 1975 and regulation 2(1) of the Mobility Allowance Regulations 1975.  The claimant appealed to a tribunal, who dismissed his appeal, and then to a Commissioner, claiming that the mobility allowance was an invalidity benefit within Article 4(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and that under Article 10 of that Regulation entitlement to that benefit could not be withdrawn on the ground that he lived in a Member State other than the United Kingdom.  The Commissioner referred two questions to the European Court of Justice.

Held, that:
1. mobility allowance granted to an employed or self-employed person under the legislation of a Member State must be treated as an invalidity benefit within the meaning of Article 4(1)(b) and was not excluded as social assistance under Article 4(4);
2. where an allowance was an invalidity benefit within Article 4(1)(b), Article 10 precluded its withdrawal on the sole ground that the recipient resided in the territory of a Member State other than the one paying the allowance.",1,119,245,,

The medical appeal tribunal of 22 August 1987 decided that the claimant was not virtually unable to walk for the purposes of regulation 3(1)(a)(ii) of the Mobility Allowance Regulations 1975 after they observed the claimant whilst walking to be slightly breathless. There was no evidence that the exertion caused severe pain or distress. The pace was not slow. The claimants appeal to the Commissioner was dismissed because the Commissioner saw no distinction between the words severe discomfort and the words severe pain or distress. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the whole phrase severe pain or distress ought to be considered, and distress, was in this context, synonymous with discomfort. The tribunal could thus be taken to mean severe discomfort when they used the words severe distress thereby applying the right test and answering the right question by inference.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
the tribunal had adopted the wrong test. If the Secretary of States submission was correct, there was no reason why the tribunal should not have used the word discomfort. Secondly, the tribunals use of the words severe pain or distress appeared to draw a distinction between pain (of which discomfort was a lesser concomitant) and distress (which could arise from pain or discomfort as well as other reasons such as breathlessness).

The claimant attained age 60 on 16 May 1979. She retired from and including 17 May 1979 and was awarded a Category A retirement pension. She continued to work after her retirement trading as a partner with her husband. An adjudication officer decided that the claimants earnings were not immediately ascertainable. The Secretary of State accordingly directed that payment of her retirement pension be suspended until her earnings could be calculated by an adjudication officer, and that in the meantime interim payments should be paid.
On 19 June 1986 the claimants husband informed the Department that the Inland Revenue had agreed profits for his wife, amongst earlier years of £3,907 for year ending 31 March 1984. The adjudication officer took 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1984 as the period for calculating the claimants weekly earnings and decided that retirement pension was not payable from 7 April 1983 to  23 November 1983 and was payable at the reduced weekly rate of £4.50 from 24 November 1983 to 11 April 1984, and after offset of interim payments there had been a recoverable overpayment of £562.50 for the period 7 April 1983 to 11 April 1984. Upon appeal the social security appeal tribunal confirmed the decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the assessment period for determining a self-employed persons earnings under regulation 5 of the Social Security (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1978 is his accounting period (para. 23);
2.	in respect of any week in which a self-employed person is gainfully employed in Great Britain his accounting period is one in which a return or statement of the emoluments or gains from that employment covering the period in which that week ends has been delivered to the Inland Revenue for tax purposes and it has been determined or agreed as the basis for an assessment to income tax (regulation 5(1)(c)) (para. 23);
3.	for calculating earnings from employment for the week in question actual earnings for the relevant accounting period must be used. This is not only unavoidable on the language of regulation 5 but is also entirely reasonable. The use of an actual year basis for calculating earnings, rather than a preceding year basis, ensures that the claimant receives his full pension entitlement for the relevant weeks (R(P) 1/73 and R(P) 1/89 followed) (para. 25);

The claimant was 65 on 22 May 1977. On 23 May 1988 he claimed SDA from 1 May 1988. It was accepted that his medical condition was such that he could have been entitled to NCIP since its introduction in 1975 and SDA which replaced NCIP in 1984. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to SDA because, at the date of claim, he had attained pensionable age. He could not be treated as entitled to NCIP before reaching that age because a claim for that benefit had never been made. And since 2 September 1985, when Section 165A of the 1975 Act came into force to limit the effect of the McCaffrey judgment, entitlement could not arise unless a valid claim was made. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who allowed his appeal.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	to be entitled to SDA, a person has to satisfy section 36(4)(d) of the 1975 Act. In this case the claimant had to show that he was entitled to NCIP on 21 May 1977, the day before he reached pensionable age;
2. 	the effects of the House of Lords judgment in the case of Insurance Officer v. McCaffrey [1985] 1 All ER 5 made it possible for a person to be entitled to a benefit without having made a claim;
3. 	the effect of section 165A of the Social Security Act 1975 was not retrospective in requiring a claim to be made before entitlement could arise and did not apply before 2 September 1985;
4. 	because the claimant satisfied the conditions of entitlement for NCIP prior to 2 September 1985, he was entitled to NCIP on 21 May 1977 in accordance with the Court of Appeal judgment in McCaffrey. As a result, the claimant was entitled to payment of SDA from 1 May 1988.

The claimant, who had been incapable of work since 28 January 1986 and was currently in receipt of invalidity benefit, was on 22 November 1988, examined by an examining medical officer of the Department of Social Security. The officer reported that in his view the claimant was capable of work at his normal occupation of joiner. The adjudication officer reviewed the current award, extending from 3 August 1988 to 31 January 1989 (both dates included), and his revised decision was that from and including 23 November 1988 the claimant was no longer entitled to invalidity benefit, because he had not proved that he was incapable of work by reason of some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement. The claimant appealed to the tribunal, challenging the examining medical officers assessment of his condition. The tribunal allowed the appeal. The Commissioner decided that the tribunals decision was erroneous in law.

Held that:
1. although it was open to the adjudication officer to review such award, if the claimant ceased to satisfy the requirements for entitlement pursuant to regulation 17(4), it was for him to show that the claimant ceased to qualify (para. 3);
2. the principle in R(S) 4/86 that an award cannot be reviewed on the basis of a different medical opinion only refers to Section 104(1)(b) of the Social Security Act 1975 and has no relevance to regulation 17(4) of the SS (Claims and Payments) Regulations (para. 4);
3. the words of regulation 17(3) are wide in their effect. Where the relevant change in contemplation is the yardstick by which the claimants capacity for work should be judged and this was likely to be altered in the near future, it is inappropriate to make an award for any indefinite period, and it is proper instead to prescribe a fixed period (para. 8).",1,59,,,

The claimant sought a review of his award of invalidity benefit to allow an increase for his first wife. He contended that he only had one wife under English law. He married his first wife in Pakistan in 1948, and that marriage was contracted according to Islamic law. He came to England from Pakistan on 22 June 1957. In 1964 he returned to Pakistan for a short period and married his second wife there in 1965. He returned to this country in 1966 with his first wife, and in 1968 his second wife came to the United Kingdom. He visited Pakistan for nine months between 13 November 1974 and 30 August 1975.

Held that:
1. the crucial issue was whether the claimant's domicile was in Pakistan at the time of each marriage (para. 7);
2. in common law the concept of domicile is regarded as the equivalent of a person's permanent home. There is a presumption in favour of the continuance of an existing domicile, and the burden of proving a change will lie on the party alleging it. The standard of proof goes beyond mere balance of probability (see Scarman J In the Estate of Fuld (No. 3) [1968] P. 675, 685, 685-686). English law presumes that a person does not lightly abandon his domicile of origin although this can be rebutted by strong evidence to the contrary. English law also presumes that a person does not acquire a domicile of choice in a country whose religion, manners and customs differ widely from those of his own country. This presumption is again rebuttable by evidence (para. 9);
3. the evidence was that at the time of his second marriage the claimant had not decided to make his permanent home in the United Kingdom. He had done nothing to show that he had abandoned his domicile of origin in favour of a domicile of choice in this country. At the date of the second marriage the claimant was still domiciled in Pakistan, and in consequence he entered into a marriage recognised in this country (para. 10);
4. the claimant was therefore polygamously married to two wives and such marriage cannot be regarded as monogamous. For the purposes of Social Security legislation, he had no ""wife"" and as a result was not entitled to an increase of invalidity benefit (para. 11).

This claim was forwarded to the Department of Social Security in the United Kingdom and a claim for UK sickness benefit was made on 23 February 1988.

The claim for sickness benefit was referred by the adjudication officer to the social security appeal tribunal, who decided on 15 December 1988 that the claimant was not entitled to sickness benefit because she was absent from Great Britain. To clarify the law the adjudication officer appealed. On 21 June 1990 the Commissioner referred preliminary questions to the European Court of Justice. The Commissioner applied the ruling of that Court in deciding that the claimant was entitled to sickness benefit.

Held that:
1.	the claimant was a worker for the purposes of Regulation 1408/71 EEC. This is because she was a person insured under United Kingdom legislation inasmuch as she would have been entitled to sickness benefit if she had resided in the United Kingdom (para. 4);

The claimant returned to England on 9 February 1983 and received supplementary benefit. A Belgian appeal tribunal reduced the period of suspension to four weeks from 20 December 1982 and as a result the claimant became entitled to unemployment benefit from 9 February to 10 April 1983.

On appeal to a British tribunal, the claimant contended that the Belgian unemployment benefit was in respect of himself alone whilst supplementary benefit took into account the needs of his family and therefore the amount of supplementary benefit to be deducted from the unemployment benefit should be reduced by that part of it which represented the needs of his family.

The claimant was a student on a four year sandwich course. The third year 1985/86 was spent working in industry. On 5 September 1986 he claimed unemployment benefit on form UB461 and stated that he intended to return to full-time education on 15 September 1986. At the same time he completed a claim form for supplementary benefit and was subsequently awarded supplementary benefit from 6 September 1986. On 15 September 1986 he told the DHSS that he was starting a course that day and supplementary benefit was suspended. The claimant wrote to the DHSS on         14 October 1986 stating that as his course was part-time he should still be entitled to supplementary benefit. Supplementary benefit was reinstated from 15 September 1986 and paid until 2 January 1987 by which time the Department had become aware that the claimant was in the final year of a full-time course. The adjudication officer determined that supplementary benefit had been overpaid to the claimant in consequence of his misrepresentation and that it was recoverable from him. On appeal, the tribunal confirmed the decision of the adjudication officer that the claimant misrepresented when he stated he was starting a course when he knew he was already engaged on a four year course and was simply returning to commence the fourth year. The tribunal also decided that there was a failure to disclose the material fact that the course was full-time. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	whether a claimant is a full-time student or a part-time student is for determination by the adjudication officer after acquiring the necessary information from the college. It is immaterial what the claimant thinks about the nature of the course. Accordingly, in the present case, no disclosure by the claimant was reasonably to be expected (para. 8);
2.	the Department of Employment were the agents of the Department of Health and Social Security for the purpose of payment of supplementary benefit and provided there was currently a claim for supplementary benefit, information given to the unemployment benefit office constituted information given to the supplementary benefit section of the Department of Health and Social Security. Information given on form UB461 should therefore be deemed to be in the possession of the Department of Health and Social Security. R(SB) 54/83 reaffirmed (para. 11);
3.	a tribunal should look at all the relevant documentation. Thus in the present case if the letter of 14 October 1986 is read in conjunction with the form UB461 the misrepresentation contained in the letter is significantly modified (para. 12).

Under the German Reparation Law he was allowed to pay contributions to the German scheme to obtain German invalidity benefit. By the time this was awarded he had been in receipt of supplementary benefit for some years. Part of the arrears of invalidity benefit were paid by the German authorities to the Department of Social Security which recovered from them supplementary benefit paid to the claimant.

2. for recovery to be made under British legislation (section 27(2) of the Social Security Act 1986 and regulation 9(1)(g) of the Payments on Account, Overpayment and Recovery Regulations) it is not necessary for the other States benefit to have been awarded under EEC Regulation 1408/71; it is only necessary that the benefit be one mentioned in Article 4(1) of that Regulation (para. 19);
3. the benefit awarded to the claimant was German invalidity benefit within Article 4(1) and the German Reparation Law under which it was obtained did not exclude it under Article 4(4) (para. 20);
4. for recovery to be made under Article 111 of EEC Regulation 574/72 it is not necessary for the other States benefit to have been awarded under Regulation 1408/71; it is only necessary for the claimant to be a person to whom that regulation applies (para. 24(1));

On application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, the applicant argued that, as an administrative mistake on the part of the Department of Social Security had resulted in interest on the mortgage being taken into account for a period substantially longer than the six months allowed by the aforementioned concession in regulation 15(4), and as the mortgage had in fact been taken out for business purposes, the Department were estopped from arguing that he was not entitled to a housing requirement in respect of the interest since their so paying the interest beyond the ending of the six months period had caused detriment to him.

On 26 September 1989 Woolf LJ refused leave to appeal of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that:
1. the detriment which the applicant claimed to have suffered was insufficient for the purposes of the law of estoppel;
2. even if estoppel would otherwise have been available, the Department, in making payments to the applicant, were exercising their statutory obligation as a Department of the Crown, and it was well established that in ordinary circumstances that could not give rise to estoppel against the Crown. Were such estoppel available, the applicant would effectively be given a claim against the Department for benefit to which he would not otherwise be entitled.",1,255,,,

An adjudication officer decided on 3 February 1986 that the claimant had been overpaid supplementary benefit amounting to £4,445.82 which was recoverable from him pursuant to section 20 of the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976. The claimant appealed to the tribunal on the ground that section 9(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 applied to the computation of any recoverable overpayment of benefit. The tribunal rejected this contention and upheld the adjudication officer's decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:

The claimant, a married man aged 54, ceased to work on 19 April 1985, claiming supplementary benefit on 3 June 1986. As his wife, aged 56, was then working full-time, the adjudication officer decided that supplementary allowance was not payable because the resources of the assessment unit exceeded its requirements. The claimant appealed against that decision to the social security appeal tribunal, which unanimously confirmed the decision of the adjudication officer. The claimant applied to a social security Commissioner for leave to appeal, having been refused such leave by the appeal tribunal chairman. The claimant having contended that the appeal tribunal had erred in law in failing to apply the principle contained in Directive 79/7/EEC (the equal treatment principle)

Held:
1.	(by the Commissioner)
(i)	the appeal tribunals decision was erroneous in law for failing to deal with the point raised by the claimant regarding the equal treatment principle, such failure involving a breach of regulation 19(2)(b) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1984;
(ii)	that Directive 79/7/EEC did not apply to the claimants case since the supplementary benefits scheme was not covered by the express provisions of Article 3(1)(a) of the Directive;
(iii)	this was also clear from article 2 of the Directive which showed that it was intended to cover schemes which can directly or indirectly be linked to the working population. Inasmuch as the supplementary benefit scheme was not so limited, since it applied to any person over 16 years of age in Great Britain, it was clearly not covered by the Directive.

2.	(by the Court of Appeal (Parker, Nicholls and McCowan, LJJ), dismissing the appeal)
(i)	a difference of treatment accorded to a man and a woman on the ground of differing marital or family status did not amount to an indirect form of discrimination on the grounds of sex and was not therefore contrary to Article 4 of the Directive;
(ii)	as there was no discrimination on grounds of sex, within Article 4 of the Directive, it was unnecessary to decide whether the supplementary benefit scheme constituted a statutory scheme of the type mentioned in Article 3(1)(a) or a form of social assistance under Article 3(1)(b).",1,117,,,

Held that:
1.	section 53(4) of the Social Security Act 1986 provides that, except where regulations otherwise prescribe, an amount shall not be recoverable unless the determination in pursuance of which it was paid has been reversed or varied on appeal or revised on review. In this case review under section 104 of the Social Security Act 1975 was appropriate and the alternative provisions of regulation 13 of the Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations do not apply (para. 4);

The claimant was a lone parent with a young child. She attended a training course and received a training allowance. She paid a child minder to look after her child while she was attending the course. On her claim for supplementary benefit the adjudication officer refused to deduct her child minding expenses from her training allowance income when calculating her entitlement to benefit. Before the social security Commissioner it was accepted that the claimant could not succeed under domestic law. On the question whether there was indirect discrimination against women in breach of either Council Directive on Equal Treatment (76/207) or Council Directive on Social Security (79/7), the Commissioner (on file CSB/372/1987) held:

1.	that a claim for supplementary benefit was a social security matter to which Directive 76/207 did not apply, and; 
2.	that Directive 79/7 was the first stage in the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security and article 3 of that Directive had not brought within its compass claims for supplementary benefit.

The claimant had been receiving supplementary benefit as an owner occupier for some years. Following a stroke, she entered hospital on 6 November 1985 and her supplementary benefit ceased. On 4 April 1986, she transferred the beneficial interest in her property by deed of gift to her two daughters. Some three weeks later, the claimant entered a nursing home and supplementary benefit was reinstated. Her appointee notified the local office on 3 October 1986 that the claimants former home was up for sale, and it sold on 21 January 1987 fetching £26,000 net. The adjudication officer then decided that supplementary benefit had not been properly payable while the claimant had been in the nursing home as she had deprived herself of her property to secure supplementary benefit. On appeal, the tribunal varied the adjudication officers decision to the extent of disallowing supplementary benefit from the end of October 1986 and requiring a review in November 1988. The claimant, through the appointee, appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. the phrase   for the purpose of  in regulation 4(1) of the Supplementary Benefit (Resources) Regulations 1981 requires the demonstration of a positive intention to secure benefit. It is not enough to assert that the natural consequences of deprivation was to secure an allowance (para. 8);
2. the intention to secure supplementary benefit need not to be the predominant motive underlying the relevant transaction (R(SB) 38/85 affirmed). In the present case, the predominant motive was doubtless to benefit the claimants children, but a significant operative purpose was also to obtain supplementary benefit and the claimant was caught by regulation 4(1) (paras. 14 and 15);
3. the claimant had to be treated as still possessed of the property, but its value fell to be disregarded for as long as regulation 6(1)(a)(i) or (iii) of the Resources Regulations applied, in this case until the house was sold (para. 15). Thereafter, the principle of diminishing capital would apply as in R(SB) 40/85 (para. 16);
4. at the time the deed of gift was made, the claimant was compos mentis; her daughter, as appointee, acted only to carry out the mechanical operation of making a formal claim and receiving benefit (paras. 9 and 13).",1,25,,,

The claimant was 53 years old when his employment ceased in July 1985. He signed as available for work at the Unemployment Benefit Office and was put on to quarterly signing in September 1986. In November 1988 the adjudication officer decided that he was not exempt from the requirement to be available for employment under regulation 6 of the Supplementary Benefit (Conditions of Entitlement) Regulations 1981. On appeal the tribunal decided that because of his age the claimant came within the conditions of regulation 6(e), by analogy as allowed by regulation 6(u), and was not therefore required to register for employment. However, the tribunal backdated the payment of the long term scale rate only for 52 weeks from the date of the application for review. They decided that the period of revision was limited by regulation 69 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986 and that this limitation could not be removed because regulation 72 of the Adjudication Regulations did not apply. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner against the refusal to apply regulation 72 and to back-date the award more than twelve months.

Held that:
1. the administrative action of putting the claimant on to quarterly signing could not, of itself, initiate a review for the purposes of considering regulation 6(e) and (u) (para. 9);
2. regulation 72(l)(a) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986 refers only to clear mistakes of fact or law arising because an officer has failed to arrive at a decision or take some action that he is obliged to do as part of his duties (para. 11);

The claimant was refused supplementary benefit because his resources exceeded his requirements. His wife worked in their daughters shop and the AO calculated a notional income from this work, sufficient, after the appropriate disregard, to remove entitlement to benefit. On appeal, the tribunal found that the means of the daughter were such that she could not afford to pay more than the actual sum of £15 per week. The claimant was therefore entitled to supplementary benefit subject to the capital limit, then £3,000. However, the tribunal went on to find that the claimant had paid into his bank account the net proceeds of a maturing insurance policy which brought his capital resources to £4,444.54. A few days after this deposit he gave the sum of £3,665 to his two daughters in repayment of alleged debts. The tribunal decided that the claimant was caught by regulation 4(1) of the Resources Regulations having deprived himself of the sum of £3,665 for the purpose of securing supplementary benefit. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	without knowledge of the capital limit a claimant cannot be caught by regulation 4(1) (para. 9). In deciding whether the claimant knew of this limit the tribunal should take account of all the circumstantial evidence, including the facts that, in the present case, the claimant was in receipt of form B3 which in turn refers to forms UBL18 and SB9 and he was an accountant with a corresponding educational standing (para. 15);
2.	where a claimant contends that he owed money to creditors his oral evidence should be supported by particular evidence as to how and when the debt was created and where possible, by documentation. Bland, unsupported allegations should be approached with grave suspicion (paras. 11 and 12);
3.	where there is a legal debt, capable of enforcement in the courts and such a debt is immediately repayable, regulation 4(1) cannot apply to any sum used to reduce or discharge that debt (para. 15).

On 17 March 1989 a tribunal allowed a claimants appeal against an adjudication officers decision that an overpayment of benefit was recoverable. In reaching their decision, the tribunal rejected the evidence in two witness statements. The adjudication officer applied to have the tribunals decision set aside in the interests of justice under regulation 11(1)(c) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations so that the witnesses could be called to give oral evidence in support of their written statements. On 23 June 1989 another tribunal set the decision aside on that ground. The case was heard again on 5 March 1990.

Held that:
1.	the phrase the interests of justice so require in regulation 11(1)(c) is limited to procedural irregularities (R(U) 3/89 affirmed). A failure by a party to an appeal to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy the tribunal is not a procedural irregularity. It is not possible where a case has failed due to want of adequate evidence to try to rectify the matter by an application to set aside (paras. 9 and 10);
2.	where a tribunals jurisdiction depends upon a determination to set aside an earlier decision, the tribunal cannot be expected to investigate in detail the decision to set aside unless that decision is plainly invalid on its face (unreported decision CI/78/1990 affirmed) (paras. 13 to 15).

The claimant, having given up her employment to care for her severely disabled adult son out of love and affection, claimed supplementary benefit. The adjudication officer decided that she performed a service for her son for which he made no payment and, accordingly, under regulation 4(3) of the Supplementary Benefit (Resources) Regulations 1981, a notional earnings resource was attributable to her, to be calculated by reference to the amount payable for comparable employment and her sons means which consisted chiefly of a war disablement pension. It was common ground that the son could not afford to pay the market rate for the service so that the notional payment to the appellant fell to be calculated by reference to the sons means. The adjudication officer treated the sons means as the excess of his resources over his requirements. As a result the notional payment to the appellant caused her resources to exceed her statutory requirements and she was not entitled to supplementary benefit.
The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal who agreed that regulation 4(3) applied, but rejected the method of computation adopted by the adjudication officer. They decided that the sons means to pay for the service provided by the appellant were represented by the amounts he would lose if he went into care at a National Health Service hospital, namely his constant attendance allowance and unemployability supplement, the aggregate of which were the notional resource attributable to the appellant. Accordingly she was entitled to some supplementary benefit but she appealed to a Commissioner on the ground that no notional resource should have been attributed to her at all. The Commissioner rejected that argument but held that the tribunal had erred in the way they determined the amount of the notional resource and restored the decision of the adjudication officer. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the claimant was performing a service which brought her within regulation 4(3);
2. regulation 4(3) conferred a discretion as to whether or not, and how, it should be applied;

The claimant, a retired teacher aged 56, was in receipt of two occupational pensions, when, on 7 November 1988, she claimed unemployment benefit. On 1 January 1989 an amendment to section 5 of the Social Security (No. 2) Act 1980 lowered the age at which the occupational pension provisions were to apply from 60 years to 55 years. The adjudication officer decided that the claimants unemployment benefit was abated by the amount of the occupational pensions she was receiving. An appeal tribunal accepted that section 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 assisted the claimant and prevented the new legislation from affecting her previously acquired right to payment of benefit. The adjudication officer was granted leave to appeal to the Commissioner.

In allowing the appeal, the tribunal of Commissioners held that:
1.	the claimant had not accrued a right to unemployment benefit because that benefit is a daily benefit and the event (a day of unemployment) which gives rise to such a right had not occurred when the amending legislation came into force (para. 15);
2.	when the event did occur, after 1 January 1989, the amended Act provided for abatement of benefit (para. 15);

On appeal the social security appeal tribunal confirmed the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed against the tribunal decision.

Held that:
1. the claimant is disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit from 1 July 1988 to 7 July 1988 because he was absent from Great Britain: Social Security Act, section 82(5)(a) (paras. 1 and 7);
2. a person is not entitled to benefit for the first three days of a period of interruption of employment: section 14(3) of that Act. It is necessary to find out what was the period of interruption of employment before section 14(3) can be applied. A period of interruption of employment must be composed, in the present case of days of unemployment (para. 20);
3. days of disqualification are not days of unemployment: section 17(1)(c) of the Act together with regulation 7(1)(b) of the Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit Regulations 1983. There is no distinction in respect of disqualification for absence abroad (para. 13);
4. it follows that the days 1, 2 and 4 July 1988 are not part of a period of interruption of employment. That began on 8 July 1988, the day the claimant returned to this country.

He received the first (£17,030.49) on 6 February 1990 and the second (£1,969.51) on 15 March 1990. This sum included the following elements: £12,423.00 for six months salary; £1,242.41 for 13 days holiday pay; £116.49 for past expenses and £3,248.59 for the employers contribution to the claimants pension fund for a period of six months. This amount was rounded up by the employers to £19,000. At the time his employment ended his contract of employment entitled him to six months notice of termination of his employment.

The claimants employment terminated on the ground of redundancy and he received, amongst other payments, a sum of £14,229.24 stated to be a severance payment. This payment was calculated entirely by reference to the claimants years of service before the termination. His contract of employment entitled him to twelve weeks notice of termination, but in the deal by which his employment was brought to an end he agreed to waive all but about two weeks notice.

Prior to 11 April 1988, regulation 22 of the Social Security (Claims and Payment) Regulation 1979 provided that the right to payment of any benefit should be extinguished where payment was not obtained within twelve months; but that regulation further provided that the twelve month extinguishment  period could be extended for  good cause. On 11 April 1988, regulation 22 was replaced by regulation 38 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulation 1987 which contained no provision for extension of the twelve month period for good cause. From 9 October 1989, however, the provision for good cause was reintroduced by regulation 38(2A).

The appointee normally claimed attendance allowance in arrears for those periods on form DS104. On 1 October 1988, he signed and submitted form DS104 claiming attendance allowance for periods his daughter had spent at home since 17 April 1987. The adjudication officer decided that payment of attendance allowance was limited to periods she had spent at home since 3 October 1987 because payment for any earlier period was not obtained within twelve months of the date the claimant had a right to be paid: regulation 38 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. That regulation came into force on 11 April 1988, which was after some of the periods he was claiming for, but before the form DS104 was received. The SSAT upheld the adjudication officers decision and the appointee appealed to the Commissioner. At the hearing before the Commissioner it was accepted that regulation 38(2A) was not retroactive.

Held that:
1.	the law to be applied was that in force at the date request for payment was received; at that date regulation 38 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulation 1987 was in operation and it contained no good cause provision (para. 14);
2.	at the date of the request for payment the claimant had no acquired or accrued right to rely on the good cause provision contained in regulation 22 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1979 and his right to payment was therefore extinguished (para. 13).

Held that:

Her husband was also severely disabled and had been awarded the higher rate of attendance allowance under that section. 

The claimant applied for the higher rate for herself, claiming that she required watching over at night because she had a tendency to fall when she had to get up to attend to her husband.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	section 35(1) was concerned with the needs of the claimant, not those of her husband who already received the higher rate of attendance allowance for his night time needs;

This appeal was the lead case of six cases on essentially the same facts and raising the same issues of law.  The claimants resided in accommodation at premises in Lancaster owned by the Lancaster Health Authority.  In terms of regulation  4(1)(c) of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) (No. 2) Regulations 1975, a payment of attendance allowance could not be made to a claimant the cost of whose accommodation may be borne wholly or partly out of public or local funds in pursuance of an enactment contained in the Schedule to the regulations.  There could have been relief from the prohibition if so directed by the Secretary of State under regulation 4(3)(b).  However, the Secretary of State had issued a certificate declining to disapply regulation 4(1)(c).  The adjudication officer had refused to make an award of attendance allowance (or had terminated existing awards on review).  The social security appeal tribunal reversed the adjudication officers decisions and ordered, or reinstated, payment.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who upheld the decisions of the tribunal.  The adjudication officer then appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Before the Court of Appeal, it was common ground between the parties that (i) the local social services authority had the Secretary of States advance approval for the making of arrangements for the provision of residential accommodation for the care of persons like the claimant suffering from illness; and (ii) had such arrangements been made, the local authority could have borne all or part of the cost of such accommodation but that the claimants accommodation had not been provided under any such arrangement.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	before considering whether or not the cost of the accommodation may be borne out of public funds for the purposes of regulations 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c), it was necessary to consider the circumstances in which that accommodation was provided.  The possibility of expending public money on accommodation could not sensibly be said to arise in all circumstances as this would deprive the opening words of regulations 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c) of all meaning and negate the object of introducing attendance allowance;

2.	regulation 4(1)(c) applied where the local authority had power to pay some or all of the cost of accommodation provided by a third party.  It did not have such power unless and until it made arrangements for the provision of the accommodation or, once the accommodation had been provided, for its cost.

She paid the fees in full and had always done so. She claimed attendance allowance through an appointee and her claim was refused on the ground that although she was eligible, the allowance was not payable for any day of residence in scheduled accommodation under regulation 4 of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Amendment (No. 3) Regulations 1983.

The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal which allowed the appeal. The adjudication officer appealed and the Commissioner refused the appeal on the main issues. The Chief Adjudication Officer and Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, which refused their appeal, and then to the House of Lords.

Held, unanimously dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	it is an essential feature of arrangements under section 26 of the National Assistance Act 1948 that the arrangements must provide for the making by the local authority to the [other party to the arrangements] of payments in respect of the accommodation provided at such rates as may be determined by or under the arrangements and as there was no such provision in the arrangements for the claimant who paid the charges herself, her accommodation was not provided under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948;

2.	as she was in accommodation for which she was paying she was not a person in need of care and attention otherwise unavailable to her pursuant to section 21(1)(a) of the National Assistance Act 1948 and the local authority was not empowered to provide accommodation under that enactment;

3.	there was no evidence that the claimant needed, or had been provided with, accommodation because of illness: she had been provided with accommodation because of her age and accordingly paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 to the National Health Service Act 1977 was not applicable, and the local authority was not providing and had no power to provide the accommodation under that enactment;

4.	regulation 7 of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 replaced regulation 4 of the 1983 Regulations with effect from 6 April 1992 and provides that if a person himself pays the whole cost, and has always paid the whole cost of the accommodation, attendance allowance is payable notwithstanding that the circumstances of that person are such that the cost of the accommodation may be borne wholly or partly out of public funds in pursuance of a Scheduled enactment. The whole cost is to be read as meaning the payment of the charge fixed for residents in respect of their individual accommodation.

The claimant appealed the decision of a social security appeal tribunal to the Commissioner who substituted a decision that because the basis of payment of income support had changed, the totality of the benefit paid to the claimant, being or including income support, was paid in consequence of the accident and was therefore recoverable by the Secretary of State. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that (i) the same amount of benefit would have been paid had the accident not happened so it was not paid as a consequence of the accident, (ii) income support would have continued as the claimant was still unemployed, and (iii) that in any event recovery of income support was limited to that part of the applicable amount relating to the claimant himself.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	as to argument (i), benefit paid after the accident was founded on medical certificates dealing with injuries caused by the accident and was therefore paid as a direct consequence of the accident;

2.	as to argument (ii), there are no specific words or other reasons to limit recovery of income support as suggested by the claimant;

3.	as to argument (iii), the unfairness to the claimants in these cases does not stem from the operation of the legislation for recovery of benefit from compensation payments but from the failure to claim damages in respect of the benefit recoverable by the Secretary of State.",1,72,,,

On 4 March 1989 the victim was injured in a road accident. On 12 June 1992 she accepted an offer of £5,500 in settlement of her compensation claim. A certificate of total benefit was issued on 8 July 1992, showing benefit to be recoverable under section 82(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 up to 28 August 1992 (the date when the certificate expired). The victim had been in receipt of income support throughout the period 4 March 1989 to 28 August 1992 but from 25 July 1991 this was on the basis of her availability for work, rather than her incapacity for work.

The compensator appealed against the certificate of total benefit. The Secretary of State considered that the appeal raised a medical question and so referred the matter to a medical appeal tribunal for determination. The medical appeal tribunal stated that the victim was still suffering from the effects of the accident but considered that the evidence showed that she was fit for light work by 1 January 1991. The Secretary of State then referred the case to a social security appeal tribunal for determination of the compensators appeal. The social security appeal tribunal decided that the victim was not incapable of work after 1 January 1991 and was not receiving benefit as a result of her injuries after that date. They therefore allowed the compensators appeal, deciding that benefit was only repayable up to 1 January 1991. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:

1.	the appeal was clearly concerned with the period specified in the certificate of total benefit on the basis that benefit paid otherwise than in consequence of the accident had been brought into account. It thus fell to be determined solely by a social security appeal tribunal under section 98(7) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, since no medical question as defined in section 98(12) arose;

2.	the social security appeal tribunal had considered the wrong question. The issue was not the victims capacity for work but whether benefit had been paid in consequence of the accident. Since the sole cause of the victims incapacity for work was the injuries she sustained in the accident and that incapacity had been accepted by the Department and income support paid on that basis up to 24 July 1991, it followed that benefit had been paid in consequence of the accident up to that date but not thereafter;

3.	the Commissioner therefore allowed the Secretary of States appeal in part and substituted her own decision that benefit paid from 25 July 1991 should not have been brought into account.",1,72,,,

A child support appeal tribunal allowed the appeal but only to the extent that the father's protected income was to be re-calculated as from 16 September 1993 when he separated from his second wife.

Held that:

1.	child support maintenance was not ""pay"" and so the obligation to pay child support was not covered by Article 119 of the European Economic Community Treaty and Council Directive 75/117/EEC (para. 6);

2.	child support Commissioners have jurisdiction to decide whether any child support regulation is ultra vires (Chief Adjudication Officer v. Foster [1993] AC 754 applied) and that includes the power to determine whether or not a regulation is irrational (CIS/391/1992 applied);

4.	the regulations were also not invalid by reason of incompatibility with section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991.

A child support appeal tribunal decided that there was a written maintenance agreement between the parties in existence before 5 April 1993. The consequence was that the Child Support Agency had no jurisdiction by virtue of paragraph 2(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1992. The parent with care appealed to a child support Commissioner. It was contended on behalf of the child support officer and the Secretary of State that whether or not there was a maintenance agreement in existence was a matter for the sole determination of the Secretary of State, not for the child support officer, and that once the Secretary of State was satisfied that there was an effective application within the meaning of regulation 2 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 the validity of such an application could no longer be questioned.

Held that:

an effective application within the meaning of regulation 2 of the Maintenance Assessment Procedure Regulations 1992 was no more than an application in the proper form. An application could not be referred to a child support officer until it was effective, but it was not incumbent on the Secretary of State to investigate the accuracy of the facts on the application form. Under section 11(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 a child support officer was required to deal with a maintenance assessment application in accordance with the provisions made by or under this Act. These words were wide enough to enable the child support officer not merely to make an assessment, but also to satisfy himself that the application had been properly made.",1,31,283,,

The parent with care, who was in receipt of income support, applied for a maintenance assessment in respect of her three children on 5 April 1993. The absent parent was a sergeant in the Army. He lived in married quarters but also owned a house which he was buying on a mortgage. He spent leave periods and long weekends in this house. The child support officers maintenance assessment made on 24 August 1993 allowed an amount for housing costs based on the rent for the married quarters. The absent parent contended that his eligible housing costs should be based on his mortgage payments on the ground that this was his principal home for the purposes of regulation 1(2) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992. He also argued that payments for regimental subscriptions and dress uniform, mess fees and the expenses of the married quarters were wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his employment and so should be deducted from his earnings. The tribunal allowed the appeal to the extent that they accepted that the house was the absent parents principal home and that payments for regimental subscriptions, mess fees and dress uniform should be deducted from his earnings. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that: 

1.	the issue of what was a persons principal home was one of fact for the adjudicating authority. The test was an objective one, directed not just at the number of nights spent in the home, but also at ascertaining what was normal at the date at which the housing costs were calculated (para. 12). The tribunal had not erred in law on this question;

2.	paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 1 to the Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases Regulations 1992 (sums not counted as earnings) only applied to payments made to, not by, an employee (para. 15). The tribunal erred in law in relying on paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 1;

3.	gross earnings in paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 1 to the 1992 Regulations meant earnings after deduction of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment (see Parsons v. Hogg, R(FC) 1/90 and R(IS) 16/93) (paras. 20 to 25);

4.	the tribunal had been entitled to conclude on the evidence that the regimental subscriptions, mess fees and dress uniform were incurred in the performance of the absent parents employment.

The absent parent applied for a review under s. 18(6) of the Child Support Act 1991 of the maintenance assessment against him but the child support officer refused to conduct a review. His appeal to a child support appeal tribunal was disallowed and he then appealed to a child support Commissioner.

Held that:

1.	in child support cases any appeal to a tribunal is against the decision made on a review application. It is thus for the tribunal to consider whether or not there are reasonable grounds for entertaining the review application and, if so, whether they show that the original decision should be revised (para. 12);

2.	the tribunal had erred in law in not concluding that there were at least grounds for review.

Tribunal jurisdiction - question whether there was a court order in force - whether a question within the jurisdiction of a child support appeal tribunal

On 19 April 1993 the parent with care applied to the Secretary of State for a maintenance assessment in respect of his two children under s. 4 of the Child Support Act 1991. The child support officer decided that the absent parent was liable to pay child support maintenance at the rate of £48.04 per week with effect from 19 April 1993. The absent parent applied for a review which was carried out by a second child support officer who decided that the absent parent should pay £49.17 per week with effect from 21 April 1993. The absent parent appealed to a child support appeal tribunal who allowed her appeal on the ground that the child support officer had failed to take account of her ground rent. The absent parent then appealed to the Commissioner, contending that the maintenance assessment did not take proper account of the welfare of the children; she also maintained that since there was a court maintenance order in existence at the date of the application for child support maintenance there had been no jurisdiction to make a maintenance assessment (see para. 2 of the Schedule to the Child Support Act 1991 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1992, SI 1992 No. 2644.

Held that:

1.	section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991 only applies to the exercise of any discretionary powers conferred on the Secretary of State or a child support officer by the Act. Thus it has no application to the making of a maintenance assessment under section 11, which is not a matter of discretion but an absolute duty (para. 7);

2.	even in relation to discretionary matters, section 2 only requires the Secretary of State or a child support officer to have regard to the welfare of any child likely to be affected by his decision. Thus it is merely something to be taken into account but should not undermine the overall purpose of the Child Support Act, that is, to ensure that the absent parent makes proper financial provision for his or her children (para. 8);

3.	although the maintenance order had not been rescinded, it was without effect as the parent against whom the order had been made was now the parent with care. The order was therefore not in force within the meaning of paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the 1992 Order and the tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the application for child support maintenance (para. 13).

The absent parent contented that the child support officer has no jurisdiction to make a child support maintenance assessment because he was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom. At the time of the application for a maintenance assessment the absent parent had worked for the Home Office for some 20 years. In August 1992 he was posted to India, initially for 18 months, but this was subsequently extended to 1997, with the possibility of a further extension for another year. The absent parent had been born in the United Kingdom and until August 1992 he had been resident here. He owned property in the United Kingdom. The child support appeal tribunal allowed the absent parents appeal, deciding that he was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, and directed that the maintenance assessment should be cancelled. The parent with care appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	to be resident in a country a person had to be seen as making a home there (CIS/1067/1995 applied). Clearly the absent parent was resident in India at the time in question. However, the issue was the meaning of habitually resident in the context of the child support scheme (paras. 6 and 9);

2.	the purpose underlying the child support legislation was the social need to require absent parents to maintain, or contribute to the maintenance of, their children. In deciding as a question of fact whether the absent parent had ceased to be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the important factors were the nature and degree of his past and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and his intentions as to the future, although the reason for his move abroad and the nature of any work there were also material. It was not enough merely to look at the length and continuity of his actual residence abroad (para. 9);

3.	the absent parent has not gone abroad to reside there indefinitely but would in due course return to this country. He was pursuing a career with the Home Office which linked him to this country and to residence here. He was paid as a civil servant here and his earnings were subject to United Kingdom tax. Thus although his posting abroad was for a substantial period of time he remained habitually resident in the United Kingdom (paras. 11 and 12).

The claimant appealed to a disability appeal tribunal essentially on the basis that she was unable to prepare a cooked main meal for herself and thereby satisfied the condition for the lowest rate of care component. There was medical evidence of a disabling condition before the tribunal, and evidence from the claimant relative to her ability to stand and to lift heavy pans. The tribunal dismissed the appeal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:

1.	the cooking test is a hypothetical test to be determined objectively, relates to a labour intensive main daily meal which it is reasonable for the claimant to prepare for one person on a daily basis, and depends on what the claimant cannot do without help.

Held that:
1.	there is no definition of blind or deaf is the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 or the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. However, in relation to industrial injuries benefit there is a description of what constitutes 100 per cent disablement where loss of sight is involved in Schedule 2 of the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982 (item 4). Similarly, for cases of occupational deafness there is machinery for assessing deafness in paragraph 34 of, and Schedule 3 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985;
2.	as regulation 12(2) of the 1991 Regulations was concerned with the degree of disablement resulting from blindness or deafness, the criteria in the 1982 and 1985 Regulations were to be applied in deciding whether a person was blind or deaf to ensure the consistent application of regulation 12(2).",1,92,,,

The claimant was Irish and lived with his wife and children in the Republic of Ireland. He had been employed since 1975 by a United Kingdom company and had been paying United Kingdom social security contributions. His wife had been employed in Ireland from 1983 to March 1991 and had then been paid successively sickness, maternity and unemployment benefit until she had returned to work in Ireland in November 1992.

In February 1991, the tribunal held that the claimant was not entitled to United Kingdom child benefit and reviewed the earlier awards. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Allowing the appeal, the Commissioner held that:

2. 	a retrospective change in the law is not only a change of circumstances justifying a review under section 25(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 but may also render an earlier decision erroneous in point of law enabling decisions to be reviewed under section 25(2) (if made by an adjudication officer) or to be made the subject of an appeal, and that, therefore, because amendments to the relevant European Community legislation made on 30 April 1992 (since the tribunals decision) took effect from 15 January 1986, the Commissioner was obliged to consider the legislation as so amended (para. 7);
3. 	Article 73 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 as amended did not apply only to preserve entitlement to family benefits already acquired under national legislation and, therefore, read by itself, entitled the claimant to United Kingdom child benefit notwithstanding that his wife was entitled to Irish childrens allowances (paras. 8 to 10);
4. 	Article 76 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71  as amended did not apply to suspend United Kingdom child benefit in this case because entitlement to Irish childrens allowances did not arise by reason of either the claimant or his wife carrying on an occupation (para. 11);
5. 	but Article 10(1)(b)(i) of Council Regulation (EEC) 574/72 applied to suspend United Kingdom child benefit up to the sum of the Irish childrens allowances because his wife was to be regarded as carrying out a professional or trade activity in Ireland, notwithstanding her periods of entitlement to sickness benefit, maternity bene-fits and unemployment benefit (paras. 11 and 12);
6. 	the claimant remained entitled to child benefit from 1 January 1989 at a rate equal to the amount by which the standard rate of United Kingdom child benefit exceeded the rate of Irish childrens allowances (para. 15).

The Commissioner also observed that:
1. 	before Article 10 of Council Regulation 574/72 was amended by Council Regulation (EEC)  1660/85, it was important that the claimants spouse should have been carrying on a professional or trade activity in the State of residence and that it was that earlier version that was considered in R(F) 2/83 and R(F) 1/88 (para. 12);

Held that:

The claimant claimed family credit on 3 January 1990. On that date she and her husband were present in Great Britain. She was not, but her husband was in remunerative employment in Algeria from where his earnings were wholly derived. The adjudication officer decided that she was not entitled to family credit because none of the claimants earnings nor her partners earnings came from remunerative work in the United Kingdom. She then made a claim for income support. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim. Her appeal was disallowed by the tribunal on the ground that her husband was her partner and he was in remunerative employment. The tribunal advised her to appeal against the adjudication officers decision disallowing family credit. She asked for a review of the family credit decision. The adjudication officer refused to review as he was satisfied that there was no ground for review. On appeal the tribunal, by a majority, confirmed the decision. On further appeal to the Commissioner she contended that regulation 3 of the Family Credit (General) Regulations did not apply to her because on its true construction it is the limited category in paragraph (2) which is deemed not to be present; the opening phrase in paragraph (1) if not if but only if indicates that it is not concerned with deeming presence but actual presence in Great Britain on a straightforward factual basis.

Held that:
1.	the first condition in regulation 3(1) is that the claimant is to be present in Great Britain. If a person who is present in Great Britain does not need to rely on that regulation in order to qualify as being in Great Britain for the purpose of entitlement to family credit, that regulation has no function at all. It can never apply;
2.	the provisions of section 20(12)(a) of the Social Security Act 1986 support the view that the regulations made thereunder were intended to define the circumstances in which a person was to be treated as in Great Britain and that any person who did not satisfy those requirements should not be regarded as in Great Britain;
3.	regulation 3(1) is not a deeming provision additional to, and in no way derogating from, a primary qualification of being in Great Britain. If that were right, merely physical presence on that day would suffice: of Reg v. Home Secretary ex p. Mughal [1974] QB 313. Once that has been established, it would be necessary to invoke regulation 3(l) and its provisions would be entirely ineffective and useless. These difficulties do not arise if regulation 3 is construed as laying down the conditions to be complied with before a claimant can be treated as being in Great Britain at the date of claim and without such compliance must be treated as not in Great Britain whether or not he was in fact physically present there on that date.

The claimant made a claim to family credit on 12 December 1990 for herself and three dependant children. The claimants husband was the vicar of a parish in Yorkshire and was stated to receive free accommodation with his employment. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant should be treated as being in receipt of earnings equal to £12 in respect of the free accommodation in accordance with regulation 19(3)(a) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations, and family credit of £2.64 was awarded. The claimant appealed against this decision. She contended that prior to 1 April 1990 the accommodation was provided free of rent and rates, but since that date both her and her husband had become liable to pay the newly introduced community charge. She argued that because of this the deemed income of £12 should be reduced by the amount of community charge payable by them, because the benefit of the rent free accommodation had been reduced. The tribunal dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. 	the decision of the social security appeal tribunal was erroneous in point of law for failure in giving adequate findings of fact and reasons (para. 9). Nonetheless it was expedient to give the decision the tribunal should have given, that family credit was payable at the weekly rate of £2.64 (para. 1);
2. 	regulation 19(3)(a) and (b) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations provide for a mandatory sum to be treated as the claimants weekly earnings where living accommodation is provided free for a claimant by reason of his employment.

The claimant married her husband according to Hindu law and custom on 4 July 1955. The husband was born on 1 June 1935 in what was then India, latterly East Pakistan and from March 1971 Bangladesh. He came to England in 1963 where he was joined by the claimant in 1968. He returned to Pakistan, latterly Bangladesh, four times between 1966 and 1984. He was granted British citizenship in about 1970. He went to Bangladesh on 3 March 1980 where he remained until his return to England on 13 December 1982.

The claimant made a claim to widows benefit on 10 February 1986, as on 5 October 1987 did the second wife. Both claims were disallowed on the ground that neither marriage was monogamous at the relevant time, the date of the husbands death. The tribunal disallowed the claimants appeal and she appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
(1) 	as set out in Dicey and Morris Conflict of Laws, under English law every person receives a domicile of origin at birth and cannot ever be without domicile. A domicile of choice can be acquired by residing in a country other than that of the domicile of origin with the intention of staying there either permanently or indefinitely. A domicile of choice may only be abandoned if a person both ceases to reside and ceases to intend to reside there; it is sufficient to prove an absence of intention to continue to reside. When a person abandons a domicile of choice he either acquires a new domicile of choice or his domicile of origin revives (para. 11);
(2) 	the husband acquired a domicile of choice in England, sometime after 1963 and before he obtained British citizenship in 1970, and subsequently abandoned it, sometime before his second marriage, his domicile of origin reviving (para. 14 and 15);
(3) 	when the husband married for the second time on 19 May 1981 his domicile of origin in Bangladesh had revived and he was subject to its distinctive legal system. This marriage must therefore be a valid and subsisting one in English law (para. 16);

The deceased, the claimant's partner, died on 8 May. Until that date they had joint title to housing benefit. On 10 May the claimant applied for a funeral payment for burial expenses of the deceased, stating that she was entitled to housing benefit. The adjudication officer rejected the application on the grounds	that the claimant's title to housing benefit had ceased upon her husband's death and so she was not entitled on the date of claim.
The tribunal allowed her appeal on the basis that according to local authority records she did have title to housing benefit on the date of claim. Upon receiving confirmation that the claimant's title to housing benefit had ceased with her partner's death, the adjudication officer successfully applied to a second tribunal to have the decision of the first tribunal set aside. A third tribunal then decided that the claimant was not entitled to a funeral payment.
The claimant appealed to the Commissioner against that decision.

Held that:
1. the Commissioner does not have the power of judicial review, which is strictly confined to the High Court. Therefore, the Commissioner could not rule on the validity of the decision of the second tribunal to set aside the decision of the first tribunal. Nor could the third tribunal. The decision of the first tribunal had been set aside by the second tribunal and the third tribunal had no power to rule on the validity of that decision of the second tribunal.

The claimant has two severely disabled sons who normally live in residential accommodation, but come to stay with her from time to time at her home. Because of their extreme disabilities it is not possible for the claimant to have both of her sons at home at the same time, and so they stay with her separately. Normally, neither of them stays for at least 35 hours in any week. However, there are occasions when their separate stays when added together, total more than 35 hours in a week. The SSAT, on a reference by the adjudication officer, decided that care for each of two severely disabled persons cannot be aggregated in respect of the number of hours in any benefit week to satisfy the conditions of caring for at least 35 hours in a benefit week regulation 4(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 refers. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:

2. where a claimant cares for two or more severely disabled persons, the test is whether he is or is likely to be caring for those persons for at least 35 hours a week. The crucial consideration is the overall length of time for which the carer is engaged in caring;
3. however many persons a claimant may be caring for, only one allowance will be payable. As it is the length of caring, rather than the number of persons cared for which determines entitlement, it is only reasonable that entitlement to one allowance will also arise on the basis of the total length of caring for a number of persons.

This question in turn depended upon whether an earlier marriage in 1962, which also took place in Pakistan, in accordance with Islamic law, was still subsisting.

The Court of Appeal (whose decision is reported as an appendix to R(G) 3/89) held that they were entitled to benefit by virtue of Council Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords who referred a number of questions to the European Court of Justice.

Held, that:
1.	the rule in question, which denied women who have attained the age of 60 benefits whereas men continue to receive them until the age of 65, was discriminatory and therefore might be justified only under Article 7(1)(a), allowing derogation in respect of determining pensionable age for the purpose of granting old age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits;
2.	due to the fundamental importance of the principle of equal treatment, Article 7(1)(a) must be interpreted strictly: Marshall v. Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health Authority [1986] ECR 723;
3.	forms of discrimination provided for in benefit schemes other than old age and retirement pension schemes could be justified, as being the consequence of determining a different retirement age according to sex, only if such discrimination was objectively necessary in order to avoid disrupting the complex financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure consistency between retirement pension schemes and other benefit schemes;
4.	the grant of benefits under non-contributory schemes, regardless of the entitlement of such persons to an old age pension by virtue of contribution periods completed by them, had no direct influence on the financial equilibrium of contributory pension schemes;
5.	the discrimination was unnecessary to preserve the financial equilibrium of the entire social security system as there were national rules to prevent overlapping of benefits and also because the grant of invalid care allowance or severe disablement allowance took the place of benefits paid under other non-contributory schemes, such as benefits paid to people who had insufficient resources to support themselves;
6.	the grant of benefits such as invalid care allowance and severe disablement allowance constituted, for women who were not yet in receipt of old age pension despite their having attained the normal retirement age, an individual right which could not be denied on the ground that, statistically, their situation was exceptional by comparison with that of most women;
7.	where a Member State prescribed different retirement ages for men and women for the purposes of granting old age and retirement pensions, the scope of the permitted derogation, defined by the words possible consequences thereof for other benefits contained in Article 7(1), was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under the other benefit schemes which were necessarily and objectively linked to the difference in retirement age.

In June 1989 a social security appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. On 26 October 1989 the Court of Appeal in McKiernon v.

On 13 July 1990 paragraph 4 (3) of schedule 6 to the Social Security Act 1990 validated regulation 25 with retrospective effect. An adjudication officer then reviewed the decision of the tribunal and disallowed the claim to benefit. The Commissioner allowed the claimant's appeal on the basis that paragraph 4(3) restored the validity of regulation 25(2) but did not effect cases where a decision had been given, before 13 July 1990, that a claim was timeous and valid.

The claimant had an industrial accident when she was run over. In due course, she was given a final assessment of her disablement arising from the loss of faculty caused by that accident (the relevant loss of faculty). Her disabilities included impaired locomotion.

The claimant subsequently sought a review of that assessment on the grounds of unforeseen aggravation. An adjudicating medical authority found that the depression and psychiatric condition which the claimant had developed subsequent to the accident was not a disability caused by a relevant loss of faculty. It was however an additional effective cause of her impaired locomotion.
The Secretary of State referred the adjudicating medical authoritys decision to a medical appeal tribunal.

The Secretary of State was of the view that a disability which was neither caused by a relevant loss of faculty, nor was itself an additional effective cause of any such disability, could nonetheless be taken into account in the aggregate of disablement if it interacted with, and made more severe, a disability which did arise from a relevant loss of faculty: the C (Connection) condition.
The tribunal made a final assessment of the claimants disablement as 20%. They found that the claimants depression and psychiatric condition was not attributable to her accident. It was not included in the assessment. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	where a disability such as the claimants depression and psychological condition arose subsequent to an accident, the following questions had to be answered (paras. 30--37);
(a)	did that condition arise from a relevant loss of faculty? If so, it was to be included in the percentage aggregate of disablement;
(b)	if it did not, was the condition an additional effective cause of a disability which did arise from a relevant loss of faculty?

(d)	if it was, then the greater disability flowing from the additional effective cause should be taken into account in the aggregate percentage disablement, less any disability which the claimant would have suffered from in any case if the accident had not occurred;
(e)	the claimants depression and psychological condition did not arise from a relevant loss of faculty, and was not an additional cause of any disability which did, then it could not be taken into account in the assessment of disablement. There was no further alternative;

Her claim was refused and a medical appeal tribunal found that she was not suffering from the disease, despite there being medical opinions before them to the opposite effect. K claimed disablement benefit in 1986 on the ground that he was suffering disablement arising from an industrial accident in 1961.  His claim failed and a medical appeal tribunal found that his present clinical findings are not attributable to the relevant accident despite there being a report before them suggesting probably major part of present disability relates to episode in 1961.  M and B were both refused mobility allowance on repeat claims made before earlier awards came to an end.

In all four cases, the Commissioners dismissed appeals, holding that the tribunals had given adequate reasons for their decisions as required by regulation 31(4) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986.  The claimants appealed.

Held, allowing all the appeals, that:
1.	where an appellate court has to consider whether the decision of a medical appeal tribunal is a lawful decision under regulation 31 (4), bearing in mind the underlying principle that fairness to the claimant requires a tribunal . to give sufficient reasons for its decision to enable the parties to know the issues to which it addressed its mind and that it acted lawfully (Regina v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex parte Cunningham [1992] ICR 816 at 827), it should approach the matter on the following lines:
(i)	the decision should record the medical question or questions which the tribunal is required to answer;
(ii)	where the tribunal has medically examined the claimant they should record their findings;
(iii)	where, however, the clinical findings do not point to some obvious diagnosis it may be necessary to give a short explanation as to why they have made one diagnosis rather than another, particularly where their diagnosis differs from a reasoned diagnosis of another qualified practitioner who has examined the claimant;
(iv)	as regards causation, in some cases it may be sufficient for the tribunal to record that it was not satisfied that the present condition was caused by the relevant trauma; but where a claimant has previously been in receipt of some benefit or allowance (particularly if paid over a long period of time) and there is no question of malingering or bad faith then an explanation should be given that allows him or his advisors to know where the break in causation has been found;
2.	in the cases of M and B, the decisions would have been unassailable had the tribunal set out and answered the various questions which the Mobility Allowance Regulations 1975 required them to address e.g. the dates to which the findings were related;
3.	in the case of E, fairness pointed, in light of the fact that the tribunal disagreed with the claimants consultant, to the need for an adjournment so that the tribunals provisional view could be brought to the attention of the claimants own advisors; and
4.	in the case of K, the tribunal should, in light of the report before them, have explained their decision in more detail than they did.

In a space on the form the claimant wrote Carcinoma of the thorac. The medical appeal tribunal confirmed the special medical boards finding that there was no evidence of prescribed diseases D1, D3, D8 or D9.

regulation 47(a) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986 permitted a tribunal to determine any diagnosis question which is related in some way to the diagnosis question referred to the tribunal.

The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal (SSAT 1) against the decision of an adjudication officer refusing his claim for severe hardship allowance. SSAT 1 refused his appeal and he applied for that decision to be set aside on the ground (amongst others) that owing to a misunderstanding his representative was not present. A clerk to the tribunal wrote a letter (containing irregularities) to the claimant seeking his further comments and he replied in writing. A second social security appeal tribunal (SSAT 2) sat to consider the application to set aside and refused the application. It is unclear whether they had the letter from the clerk and the claimants reply before them and there is no evidence that a copy of the claimants application was sent to the adjudication office or that the adjudication officer had an opportunity to make representations on the application. The claimant applied to the chairman for leave to appeal to the Commissioner but instead of granting or refusing that application the chairman decided that a further tribunal should consider the application to set aside. That tribunal (SSAT 3) set aside the decision of SSAT 1 because it appeared just to do so on the ground that the claimants representative was not present at the hearing. It is not clear whether SSAT 3 was aware of the decision of SSAT 2. A further social security appeal tribunal (SSAT 4) reheard the original appeal and awarded severe hardship allowance. An adjudication officer appealed to a Commissioner against the decision of SSAT 4 contending that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because SSAT 2 had refused to set aside the decision of SSAT 1. Owing to a conflict between two reported decisions on the issues, R(SB) 4/90 and R(G) 3/93, the Chief Commissioner directed that a Tribunal of Commissioners should hear the appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. Commissioners may investigate the validity of prior decisions or determinations of appeal tribunals where that is necessary in order to determine whether the appeal tribunal whose decision is under appeal had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. An appeal tribunal must also, in the course of establishing whether it has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal, in the light of the broad principle of res judicata, be able to investigate whether a decision of an earlier tribunal on the same appeal has been effectively set aside (para. 27). However, in determining whether an earlier appeal tribunals decision is valid or not, Commissioners and appeal tribunals may only consider whether the earlier appeal tribunal had jurisdiction in the narrow sense of being entitled to enter on the consideration of the matter before it (para. 28) (R(SB) 4/90, R(SB) 4/92, CI/78/1990 and R(G) 2/93 not followed);
2. these conclusions should be applied to the present case as follows (para. 35):
(i) the decision of SSAT 1 was given within jurisdiction and disposed finally of the claimants appeal unless it had been set aside under regulation 11 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986, reviewed or set aside by a Commissioner on appeal,
(ii) the decision of SSAT 2 was within jurisdiction notwithstanding that there was no evidence that the adjudication officer was given an opportunity to make representations on the application and that the clerks letter to the claimant contained serious irregularities,
(iii) the determination of SSAT 3 was made without jurisdiction, in that the claimants application had already been determined by SSAT 2 acting within jurisdiction. The chairman had no authority to treat the claimants application for leave to appeal against SSAT 1 as a request for reconsideration of the refusal to set aside by SSAT 2,
(iv) SSAT 4 had no jurisdiction to entertain and determine the appeal and SSAT 1s decision stood and finally disposed of the appeal.

The Commissioners set aside the decision of SSAT 4. They directed that a chairman consider the claimants outstanding application for leave to appeal to the Commissioners against SSAT 1.",1,60,283,,

The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal, distinguishing between the ethical duty to play football and being on duty as a police officer. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the primary consideration is the extent of the employment and the specific duties of the employee, the secondary consideration being whether the event was in the discharge of a duty or something reasonably incidental thereto;

On appeal, the tribunal confirmed the decision. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	whether or not a claimant is engaged in remunerative work is a question of fact. However, it must be determined in accordance with the specific terms of the regulation. The tribunal erred in law by adopting as a definition of in expectation of payment the words of the Commissioner in R(FIS) 1/83 work carried out with the desire, hope and intention of claiming a reward or profit. The Commissioner was there defining, for the purposes of family income supplement legislation, the phrase remunerative work (which was not defined in that legislation) and not in expectation of payment (paras. 7 and 8);
2.	desire and hope form no part of the definition in regulation 5(l), which clearly provides that such work must be carried out either for payment or in the expectation of payment. Expectation is not the same as desire, intention or hope (para. 9);
3.	work carried out in expectation of payment means in realistic expectation of such payment (para. 11);
4.	this claimant hoped to have work accepted and paid for, but was in fact working on spec which is in hope, not expectation of payment (para. 13);

On 21 March 1990 the claimant applied for income support. The claimant stated that she had savings totalling £6,195.20 deposited in a Building Society account in her sole name. She explained that the account had been taken out when she had been single but that over the previous three to four years the bulk of the money deposited had come from her husband. She further explained that the account was a matrimonial asset that was subject to divorce proceedings and that her solicitors had advised her that the most she could hope to retain from the account was half of its value.

The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was the sole beneficial owner of the monies in the account and disallowed benefit for the period 8 March 1990 to 10 April 1990 on the grounds that the claimants capital exceeded the prescribed amount i.e. £6,000. Income support was awarded from    11 April 1990 taking into account a tariff income based on capital of £6,195.20. On appeal a tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	beneficially entitled in possession means that a person is entitled to an asset for his own benefit and not as a trustee for others (para.  9);
2. 	the general rule is that where a person transfers his property to a stranger a resulting trust arises in favour of the transferor, but in the case of a transfer by a man to his wife or child a presumption of advancement arises instead (para. 11);
3. 	in present day conditions the presumption of advancement as between huband and wife is weak and can readily be rebutted by evidence to the contrary (para. 12);
4. 	where savings have been made possible by joint efforts or indirect contributions it is necessary to look beyond the question of who provided the funds (para. 13);
5. 	once it has been established that beneficial ownership is shared regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 applies. Each beneficial owner is treated as having an equal share of the savings account (para. 14).

He also declared his wifes earnings; she was a supply teacher who was paid monthly in arrears but her earnings varied greatly and he intended that his wifes income should be calculated over the period of a year. He further declared that monies deposited in three bank accounts totalled £8,063.85 as to date of claim and £7,944.99 on 8 November 1990, but contended that money in current account should not be treated as capital as it was constantly being used to pay for current expenses.
The adjudication officer decided that income support was not payable as the claimants income (including tariff income) exceeded his applicable amount. On appeal a tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner allowed the appeal.

Held that:
1.	a claim for income support was to be treated as being for an indefinite period (regulation 17(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987); it was, therefore, an open-ended claim and the facts must, if the situation is fluid, be looked at week by week:
observations in R(SB) 4/85 at paragraph 13 applied (para. 18);
2.	the amount of the wifes earnings must be calculated on a weekly basis (if necessary by reference to her contract of employment) and determined at the date when the claim was considered: (para. 13);
3.	in order properly to determine the amount of the claimants wifes earnings to be taken into account it was necessary to make findings of fact (if necessary by reference to the earners contract of employment) as to the following:
(a)	the amount of the earnings;
(b)	whether any sum fell to be disregarded under Schedule 8 to the Income Support (General) Regulations;

(d)	and the date that the earnings were due to be paid: regulation 31(1)(a) of those regulations, (para. 17);
4.	income paid into a bank current account does not undergo the metamorphosis into capital for income support purposes until tax liabilities have been deducted and the period over which it falls to be attributed under regulation 29 of those regulations has elapsed; observations in R(SB) 2/83 at paragraph 6 and R(SB) 35/83 at paragraphs 4 and 5 applied (para. 22);

On a claim form for income support dated 30 January 1990 the claimant declared that he had no capital assets. However, he had sold the house he had previously lived in for £29,000 in January 1989.

The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the grounds that the claimant had failed to provide sufficient evidence about the amount of capital received and how he had disposed of it. The claimants appeal to a tribunal was dismissed. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	it is not always necessary for tribunals to record specific findings of fact. Tribunals can adopt a statement of facts from the adjudication officers submission, especially where matters are not in dispute. However, this approach is only acceptable if;
(i)	what is incorporated in the tribunals findings is a statement of conclusions on disputes of fact and;
(ii)	that statement, where it constitutes the sole recorded findings, includes all the relevant matters on which findings are necessary (para. 11);
2.	the need for verification of information provided by the claimant does not, in itself, justify a delay in the submission of the claim to an adjudication officer. Once the Secretary of State makes that submission, it is irrelevant whether or not the claimant has satisfied regulation 7(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations or provided enough information for the Secretary of State to refer the claim to the adjudication officer since those issues are for the Secretary of State to decide. The adjudication officers duty is to consider the claim and, so far as practicable, dispose of it within 14 days of its submission. But adjudication officers may make further investigations or ask for more evidence. Alternatively, they may determine the claim on the evidence currently available, especially when the claimant has had a reasonable opportunity of producing the required information or evidence. R v. Secretary of State for Social Services and another, ex parte CPAG and others [1990] 2 QB 540, applied (para. 13);
3.	it is not of itself a ground of disentitlement to IS that a claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim. However, the essential elements of entitlement must be considered in the light of the evidence available. If a claimant is thought by the AO to have provided insufficient evidence on a relevant issue, where the burden of proof is on the claimant to make out his claim, that issue should be decided against the claimant (para. 14).

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the tribunals decision was erroneous in law. It was based on an adversarial approach to the case in that, when considering the facts, they failed to inquire into, and make findings on, the written evidence before them.

On 11 April 1988 he became entitled to income support, the amount being less than he had received by way of supplementary benefit. He accordingly was entitled to a transitional addition of £7.94 per week to make up the difference. In October 1988 one child was taken into care and the fathers income support was reduced by the weekly amount applicable to that child.

The  adjudication officer decided that the fathers applicable amount had increased for the purpose of regulation 14(1)(a) of the Income Support (Transitional) Regulations 1987 and that accordingly his transitional addition was no longer payable (the applicable amount for the child being more than £7.94). The Commissioner dismissed the  adjudication officers appeal against a social security appeal tribunal decision in the claimants favour.

On 12 March 1992 the Court of Appeal (Gibson and Butler-Sloss LJJ, and Sir Stephen Brown) dismissed a further appeal by the  adjudication officer and held that:
the Commissioner had correctly interpreted regulation 14(1)(a) in deciding that the restoration of an applicable amount of a claimants income support for a child returned home from temporary local authority care was not an increase in his applicable amount for the purpose of that regulation.

The claimant, a separated married woman receiving income support since 1989, on 29 January 1990 claimed a payment to meet the estimated expenses of the funeral of her nephew who had died on 13 January 1990. The funeral was delayed. On 15 January 1990 the claimants sister, the deceaseds mother, instructed undertakers and accepted responsibility for the funeral costs.

The local tribunal confirmed the rejection on the grounds that since the claimants sister had accepted responsibility for the funeral costs, the claimant could not be the responsible member, and that the subsequent acceptance of responsibility by the claimant did not alter the fact that at the date of claim she was not the responsible member.

Held that:

2.	the claimant on 23 February 1990 undertook responsibility for her nephews funeral, with the agreement of both her sister and the undertaker.

Income support was awarded from 4 October 1990 and on 16 July 1991 the adjudication officer decided that the claimants housing costs would be nil from 4 October 1991 because:

(2)	it is reasonable to expect the claimant and his family to obtain alternative accommodation;
(3)	the housing costs are regarded as excessive.

The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal which allowed the appeal. The tribunals reasons for allowing the appeal were:
although there are homes for sale in his area, they are not in practical terms available to the claimant since, despite all his best efforts, he cannot sell his home, and therefore he does not have the resources to purchase a new home.
The tribunal decided that the claimants inability to sell his home was a relevant factor under paragraph 10(7) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.

Held that:
1. 	the inability of the claimant to obtain suitable accommodation which is on offer is a relevant factor. That factor is subjective because it must include consideration of the personal circumstances of the claimant and his family (para. 12);
2. 	the question of whether it is not reasonable to expect the claimant and his family to seek alternative cheaper accommodation, having regard to the relevant factors is just as much a question of fact as the question of reasonableness. In so concluding the Commissioner confirmed the principle, set out in R(SB) 8/88, that the decisions of social security appeal tribunals on questions of fact should not be disturbed unless there is some demonstrable error of law (para. 14).",1,173,,,

The claimant had been in receipt of supplementary benefit since 25 April 1973. The claimants appointee asked for a review of her supplementary benefit with effect from 15 January 1979. She asked for payment to cover the extra baths and laundry needs arising from the claimants incontinence. The adjudication officer awarded additional requirements for baths and laundry from   24 November 1980, the date that prescribed payments for these needs were introduced.
On appeal the tribunal went further than had been initially requested and trade an award retrospectively from 25 April 1973. But they reduced the number of extra baths because the claimants father was in receipt of a concessionary fuel allowance. The claimants appointee appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the tribunal should not have had regard to the concessionary fuel allowance when awarding an allowance for baths (para. 4);
2.	an award of supplementary benefit or income support continues in force until that award is reviewed and revised. The revised decision replaces the original decision on the award and benefit is paid on the basis of that revised decision.

On 28 May the claimant applied for a funeral payment in respect of the burial of the deceased on 30 May. At the date of claim the claimant was receiving income support and housing benefit, had no capital, but had arrears of attendance allowance. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim for a funeral payment on the ground that the assets of the deceased which were available to the claimant extinguished the funeral payment. On appeal the tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the arrears of attendance allowance were properly paid to the claimant as next of kin. The principles of the general law required him to use the arrears to discharge any debts of the estate, and the funeral expenses would be the first such debt. As the arrears were sufficient to meet the funeral expenses the need for a funeral payment did not arise (para. 5);
2.	regulation 8(a) of the Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regu-lations 1987 requires that assets of the deceased be deducted from any award; the arrears of attendance allowance exceeded the award; therefore, no payment could be made (para. 6);

On 9 October 1990 the adjudication officer revised the award of supplementary benefit/income support for the period 26 January 1985 to 18 September 1989 and determined that there had been an overpayment of benefit recoverable from the claimant. This was because he had failed to disclose that his wife had capital assets in excess of £6,000. On appeal the tribunal upheld the decision of the adjudication officer, finding that the claimants wife held 99% of the shares in a private limited company which had assets that included a freehold property worth over £20,000.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the claimants wife was in a position analogous to that of a sole owner or partner in the business and consequently Income Support (General) Regulations 1987,  regulation 51(4) applied (para. 6);
2.	she was to be treated as possessing 99% of the capital of the company.

In November 1987 the claimant received £38,777.45 from the sale of the matrimonial home. On      19 November 1987 he deposited £28,000 in his bank. He withdrew various sums including £8,000 on 30 November 1987 and £18,500 on 3 December 1987. On 21 December 1987 his account was overdrawn. On 16 December 1987 he claimed supplementary benefit. On 15 March 1988 the adjudication officer disallowed the claim. On 1 February 1989 the social security appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal on the basis that he possessed actual capital in excess of the prescribed limit of £3,000. They did not believe the claimants statement that he had paid £18,500 to his creditors. On   13 February 1989 he claimed income support. On 20 March 1989 the adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the basis that he possessed actual capital in excess of the prescribed limit of £6,000. On appeal the tribunal found that the claimant had not actual capital and intimated that they wished to consider the difficult question whether the claimant had notional capital under regulation 51(1). They refused the adjudication officers application for an adjournment. They decided by majority that he had deprived himself of a considerable capital sum for the purposes of obtaining supplementary benefit but found unanimously that that did not affect his claim for income support. 

On appeal the adjudication officer conceded in his written submission to the Commissioner that the claimant, at the relevant time, had no actual capital.

Held that:
1.	the Commissioner has inquisitorial jurisdiction and has to consider every point relevant to the issue, whether put forward by the parties or not and he was not bound by any concession made by either party (para. 7);
2.	the adjudication officer was expected to deal with the question whether or not the claimant had actual capital in excess of the prescribed limit. When the tribunal concluded that he had not, an extremely difficult point of law (whether he had any notional capital) arose. In those circumstances the adjudication officer should have been given an adjournment to consider his arguments on the issue (para. 8);
3. 	it is puzzling why it was that regulation 51(1) was not drafted with the words supplementary benefit or between the words to and income support. Without such express words there is a strong case for saying that the legislature never intended regulation 51(1) to embrace the deprivation for the purposes of securing entitlement to supplementary benefit (para. 13);
4. 	regulation 51(1) was not a new provision. It came into existence with the income support legislation which conferred benefits, and the regulation posed a restriction on such benefits. This was not a case where, after income support had come with its concomitant benefits into operation, the regulation was subsequently brought into existence operating in response to events which had previously taken place (Yew Bon Tew v. Kenderaan Bas Mara (PC) [1983] AC considered) (paras. 15-16);
5. 	there is nothing to prevent regulation 51(1) operating retrospectively if its provisions are relevant to the facts in question. At the time the claimant divested himself of the property income support did not exist. It is difficult to see how a person could deprive himself of property for the purposes of obtaining income support, if such benefit at that time was non-existent (Secretary of State for Social Security and Another v. Tunnicliffe [1991] 2 ALL ER 712 followed [R(G) 4/91]; unreported decision CIS/259/1990 not followed) (paras. 15-16);
6.	when the claimant divested himself of capital in November/December 1987 he simply could not have done it with the intention of obtaining income support because that was a benefit which, not withstanding that the Royal Assent had been given to the Social Security Act 1986, at that time still did not exist. Nor could it be said that the description income support only meant the means tested benefit which previously went under the name supplementary benefit. Although the income support scheme and the supplementary benefit scheme have characteristics in common, including means testing, they are in no sense identical. The benefits are differently calculated and the income scheme was drafted afresh as a wholly new scheme (para. 16).",1,61,,,

The claimant, who had been receiving supplementary benefit followed by income support since 1986, bought a house for £70,000 in 1989. On 29 August 1990, a tribunal (the first tribunal) decided that the amount allowed in the claimants income support for housing costs should be restricted to the amount she would have had to borrow if she had bought a property for £55,000. Her housing costs were assessed at £126 per week.

On 14 November 1990, an adjudication officer reviewed the tribunals decision on a relevant change of circumstances, that is, the reduction in interest rates. The revised decision allowed housing costs at £119.73 per week. The claimant appealed against this decision to a second tribunal. The claimants representative argued that this tribunal should review the decision of the first tribunal on the ground that it was no longer reasonable to expect the claimant to seek cheaper alternative accommodation. The second tribunal decided that the change in the interest rate was a relevant change of circumstances entitling the adjudication officer to review the decision of the first tribunal. But they refused to revise the decision of that tribunal relating to allowable housing costs. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the reduction in the mortgage interest rate is a relevant change of circumstances giving grounds for review under section 25(l)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act. Neither the provisions in paragraph 7(8) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 nor regulation 69(2) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986 applied in this case (para. 6);
2.	if a claimant can establish grounds for review of a decision relating to the restriction of housing costs for the first time at the tribunal hearing, it is open to the tribunal to deal with the matter as a question first arising under section 36 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The duty of a tribunal is to consider whether they should exercise their discretion under this section. In the present case, the tribunal erred in law in not considering whether or not to use their discretion to deal with the wider change of circumstances that was before them. But this does not mean that when there are grounds for review the whole determination is thrown open for consideration (paras. 7 and 8).

On 13 June 1991 the claimant applied for income support. The claimants wife was employed by a County Council as a home care organiser with specific responsibility for the meals on wheels service. She worked for 19½ hours per week. A deduction of £86 per month was made from her salary by her employer being her contribution towards the cost of hiring a car which was used for work but which was also available for private use. The adjudication officer decided that the sum of £86 per month could not be deducted in the calculation of the monthly gross earnings of the claimants wife, nor could this amount be disregarded. On appeal the tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the social security Commissioner who allowed the appeal, remitting the case for rehearing by a fresh tribunal.

Held that:
1.	as the deductions in respect of part payment for the hire charges on the car were payments made by the claimants wife and not payments by her employer, they were not covered by regulation 35(1)(f) nor by regulation 35(2)(c). Although regulation 35(2)(c) does not explicitly refer to payments by an employer or third party, it must nevertheless be so confined: decision R(FC) 1/90 followed (para. 8);
2.	there is no express provision in the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 for the deduction of earnings paid out by an employee but the use of the word earnings in regulation 36 brings into play the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Parsons v. Hogg [1985] 2 All ER 897, CA (included in the appendix to R(FIS) 4/85). Consequently in ascertaining what the claimants wifes earnings were under the provisions of regulation 36 there must be allowed the deduction of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the claimants wife in the performance of the duties of her employment: decision R(FC) 1/90 followed (para. 10);
3.	in determining whether the whole or part of the £86 was paid by the claimants wife in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment the new tribunal may have regard to any agreement made by the claimant (or his wife) with the Inspector of Taxes. The income tax cases relating to that wording wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred etc. form a useful guide to the interpretation and practice of the regulations on this point; decision R(FC) 1/90 followed (para. 13);
4.	the question of whether and to what extent the hire costs of the car should be attributed between work and private use was one of fact for determination by the new tribunal but the tribunal would need to take account not only of the claimants wifes actual private use of the car but also of the fact that the claimants wife had the facility of the car for private use; that is to say, the car was available for her private use even if she did not take advantage of that facility (paras. 11 and 13).",1,106,,,

The claimant made a claim for benefit on the basis that her husband, who was in remunerative work, was not living at home as he was remanded on bail in a bail hostel. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant and her husband were a married couple under paragraph 1 of regulation 16 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 As her husband was in remunerative work income support was not payable. The tribunal found that the conditions of the husbands bail excluded him from being a member of the claimants household under paragraph (3)(b) of regulation 16 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The claimant was entitled to income support as a single claimant as the conditions of her husbands bail were such that he was to be treated as detained in custody pending trial. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	bail is a legal alternative to custody. Terms under which bail is given will vary. Sometimes there will be no restriction, more likely sureties will be needed. Additional conditions may be imposed including staying at a bail hostel or avoiding certain places. Bail will leave a person with their liberty (para. 6);
2.	where one of a couple leaves the dwelling occupied as the home it should be assessed whether that person intends to return to occupy the dwelling and, if so, whether the absence is likely to exceed 52 weeks.

The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal.

On 10 November 1988, before the appeal was heard, the Department received confirmation that both properties had been put up for sale.

When applying for income support from 26 July 1988 the claimant stated that he owned property in addition to that occupied as his home. It transpired that he owned an unoccupied residential property and a tenanted shop. The claimant had a mortgage which had been taken over by his bank. He was in dispute with the bank over a further loan of £120,000 taken out to purchase a farm.
On 3 May 1988 the bank had obtained a judgement against the claimant in respect of £31,458 and had obtained charging orders against both properties to enforce the judgement. The bank held the deeds to both properties and had registered notice of deposit of the land certificates with HM Land Registry as security against the further loan.

On 10 November 1988 the claimant put both properties up for sale and as a result an award of income support was made. On appeal the adjudication officers decision for the period to 9 November 1988 was upheld The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. 	it was perverse of the tribunal to accept valuations of the properties produced by the District Valuer disregarding the offer prices as wholly unrealistic on an associated appeal heard the same day but to accept the offer prices of the properties as the market value in this appeal (para. 16);
2. 	although notice of deposit of the land certificates is not itself an incumbrance it serves as a caution at the Land Registry and is notice that the certificates are held as security for money. The notice of deposit in this case were clear evidence that incumbrances were secured on the properties (para. 17);
3. 	although the onus of proving entitlement rests with the claimant that onus does not absolve the statutory authorities from investigating and ascertaining the facts (para. 19);
4. 	in order to decide whether property constitutes capital which will affect entitlement to income support it is necessary for the adjudicating authorities to establish:
(a) 	the date of claim;
(b) 	who has legal title and who is the beneficial owner(s) at the date of claim. If there is no caution or restriction on the land register it is probable that the registered proprietor of the land is also the beneficial owner;
(c) 	who is in occupation of the property and the nature of that occupation. Such findings are essential in order to determine whether the property can be disregarded under provisions in Schedule 10, and if necessary for a proper valuation to be made;
(d) 	the market value of the claimants (and or his or her partners) interest in the property at the date of claim. Market value is the price which would be obtained between a willing buyer and willing seller without regard to any encumbrances secured on the property;
(e) 	whether a sale would involve expenses. In the case of land, expenses would be involved and so 10 per cent should be deducted from the market value;
(f) 	the amount of any incumbrances secured on the property. Capital is subject to an incumbrance if a creditor has a secured right to resort to it (or prevents its disposal) until satisfaction of his debt in preference to that of any unsecured debtor;

(i) 	the amount of any incumbrances must only be deducted once. If it is secured on two or more properties of which the value of each falls to be taken into account, their value should be aggregated and the incumbrance deducted from the total (para. 19(7)(b));
(ii) 	all sums secured by incumbrances held by different incumbrancers must be aggregated when secured on the same property or properties (para. 19(7)(e));
(g) 	the period in issue. On a fresh claim this will usually be from the date of claim down to the date on which the statutory authority gives its decision. If the situation is fluid the claim must be looked at week by week and findings as to the position in weeks subsequent to the date of claim should also be made on each of the points on which findings have been made in respect of the date of claim (para. 19(8)(a)).

The issue was whether in the relevant circumstances and in accordance with the regulations in force since 9 October 1989 the appellant was entitled to the severe disability premium as part of her income support. On appeal to the Commissioner it was held that so much of paragraph 13(2)(a) as operated to defeat the appellants claim to that premium was ultra vires and was severable from the remainder of the sub-paragraph which established her entitlement. On appeal by the Chief Adjudication Officer and the Secretary of State to the Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR, Beldam and Nolan LJJ) it was held:
 (1) unanimously, that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to question the vires of a regulation made by the Secretary of State, so that the appeal fell strictly to be allowed on that ground alone, but that it was possible and appropriate for the court to consider the substantive issue by the device of allowing the appellant to invoke its original jurisdiction to entertain an application for judicial review; and 
(2) by a majority (Beldam and Nolan LJJ) that the provision was intra vires, Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR holding that the provision was ultra vires but that it was not severable from the rest of the regulation (Chief Adjudication Officer and Secretary of State for Social Security v.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

2.	as a matter of construction the appellants contention that the only conditions of eligibility for the severe disability premium which the Secretary of State was empowered to impose by section 22(4) of the Social Security Act 1986 must relate directly to the claimants disablement was untenable, a conclusion which was reinforced by an examination of the parliamentary material in accordance with the principle in Pepper v. Hart [1992] 3 WLR 1032;

The adjudication officer decided that he was no longer entitled to the transitional addition under regulation 14(2)(a)(1) of the Income Support (Transitional) Regulations.

It does not matter that the proceedings are discontinued before trial, and in fact no trial takes place. For the period he was in custody the claimant was a prisoner within regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations.

In 1989 the claimant, an owner-occupier, took out a loan of £7,020 for repairs and improvements to the dwelling occupied as the home. On a claim for income support, dated 19 November 1990, the claimant asked for the interest on the loan to be paid as a housing cost. The adjudication officer did not allow any housing costs in respect of the loan. On appeal the tribunal varied the adjudication officers decision and allowed interest on £3,510 of the loan, finding that expenditure: on some of the items of repair and improvement fell within paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, whereas expenditure on others did not. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner and contended that by reason of paragraph 1(a) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, when read in conjunction with paragraph 2, she was entitled to mortgage interest on that part of the loan, taken out for effecting repairs and improvements, not falling within paragraph 8. Accordingly, she was entitled to the interest on the whole loan, and in respect of the part falling outside paragraph 8, she was not restricted to the 50% rate for the first 16 weeks.

Held that:

2.	paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 only lists the types of expenses that fall to be considered as eligible housing costs (para. 11);

The claimant, whose late husband had been a miner, received a cash payment of £6.92 per week from the National Coal Board. This payment was in lieu of concessionary coal and was made pursuant to an agreement between British Coal and the National Union of Mineworkers. The adjudication officer decided that this income fell to be taken into account in full in the calculation of the claimants income support. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, the point at issue being whether the weekly payment was voluntary and could therefore be disregarded. Upholding the adjudication officers decision the tribunal decided that the payment was not voluntary because it was legally enforceable. 
The claimant appealed to the social security Commissioner. The Commissioner decided that the tribunals decision was erroneous in point of law. The tribunal had reached the right conclusion on the basis of an incorrect interpretation of the law.

Held that:
1.	the question whether a payment of cash in lieu of concessionary coal of the type received by the claimant was voluntary was considered in the context of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 and the Community Charge Benefit (General) Regulations 1989 in R v. Doncaster Borough Council, ex parte Francis Alice Boulton and it was held there that such a payment was not voluntary;
2. 	in that judgement Laws J said that the word voluntary in the context of housing benefit and community charge benefit legislation denoted the obtaining or giving of something without anything being obtained in return;
3. 	the provision allowing for a partial disregard to apply to voluntary payments was not at all concerned with the question whether or not the payer had entered upon legal obligations; it was concerned with cases where a person or body, outside the state, had shouldered some part of the burden of providing relief to persons living in the kind of economic circumstances which will allow the payment of an income-related benefit, without receiving anything in return;
4. 	the national agreement (under which cash payments in lieu of concessionary coal are made) was entered into by British Coal in the interests of good labour relations so as to better secure the willing services of its employees. British Coal therefore made the agreement in the expectation of improved industrial relations and efficiency being obtained in return. This legitimate and proper purpose was far removed from the purpose of benevolence which lies behind the term voluntary in the regulations;
5. 	the payment in lieu of concessionary coal in this case was not voluntary. The principle enunciated by Laws J in R v. Doncaster Borough Council, ex parte Francis Alice Boulton in relation to the Housing Benefit and Community Charge Benefit Regulations applies equally to the interpretation of paragraph 15 of Schedule 9 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 198",1,111,,,

After lodging an appeal with the tribunal the claimant withdrew it with leave of the chairman. The claimant later sought to appeal once more from the same adjudication officers decision, by which time the appeal was late. Although a chairman accepted special reasons for lateness and admitted the appeal, at the hearing the new tribunal declined jurisdiction because the claimant had previously withdrawn an appeal against the same decision.

Held that:
1. 	provided that, where necessary, the chairman has granted leave for a late appeal, there is no obstacle to a fresh appeal being brought against an adjudication officers decision which has been the subject of a withdrawn appeal (para. 10);
2. 	the rule that, when once a matter has been adjudicated on by a competent authority, another authority of the same level cannot re-adjudicate on the point (res judicata) would not apply.

3. 	following the general principles laid down in the Rules of the Supreme Court (see annotation no. 16 to Order 59; Rule 1), if the tribunal were to dismiss an appeal to it on a withdrawal by the claimant then the matter would be res judicata and no subsequent appeal on the same subject could be brought to a social security appeal tribunal. The decision to dismiss, however, would be subject to review and appeal to the Commissioner in appropriate cases (para. 12);

Recovery of overpayment - representation on claim form - whether qualified by declaration at the end of the form

On 5 December 1988, J claimed unemployment benefit from the Department of Employment and income support from the Department of Health and Social Security. On his income support claim form, he declared that that he had claimed unemployment benefit.  He received his first payment of unemployment benefit on 13 December 1988 and thereafter received regular girocheques.  He received an order book for income support on 21 December 1988 and cashed orders after signing on each one a declaration that I have correctly reported any fact which could affect the amount of my payment and that I am entitled to the above sum.  He did not report to the Department of Health and Social Security the fact that he had been awarded unemployment benefit.  Income support was overpaid because the unemployment benefit was not taken into account.  The Commissioner held that the overpayment was recoverable under section 53 of the Social Security Act 1986 on the basis that J had misrepresented a material fact when signing the declaration on the order book.  J appealed on the ground that a representation that material facts had been correctly reported was not itself a representation as to a material fact and a representation that he was entitled to the benefit was a representation of law and not of fact.

S claimed supplementary benefit on a form on which he answered no to a question whether he or his partner had any life insurances or endowment policies and at the end of which he declared: As far as I know, the information on this form is true and complete.  In fact, unknown to S, his partner did have life insurances or endowment policies.  Supplementary benefit was overpaid because the policies were not taken into account.  The Commissioner held that the overpayment was recoverable because the claimant had misrepresented a material fact when completing the claim form.  S appealed on the ground that he had represented only that he did not know that he and his partner had any life insurances and endowment policies.

Held, dismissing Js appeal (Evans LJ dissenting) and allowing Ss appeal, that:
1.	by signing the order book declaration, J had represented that he had correctly reported any facts known to him and (per Stuart Smith LJ) that was a representation as to a material fact because, unless it was true, the claimant was not entitled to any benefit and (per Dillon LJ) the representation could not be qualified by the addition of words such as in so far as disclosure could reasonably be expected of me;
2.	(per Evans LJ)  the declaration I am entitled to the above sum was a representation of law although it might include a representation of fact such as I, the person claiming, am the person to whom the award was made or to whom the order book was sent;
3.	(per Stuart Smith LJ)  J failed to disclose a material fact because he knew he was in receipt of unemployment benefit and must have known that it affected the amount of income support to which he was entitled;
4.	(per Stuart Smith LJ)  where the order book declaration is signed, an overpayment is recoverable by reason of either misrepresentation or failure to disclose, provided the failure to disclose is established;

5.	Ss statement that he and his partner had no life insurances or endowment policies was qualified by the form of words used in the declaration at the end of the claim form and it therefore amounted only to a representation that, as far as he knew, they had no policies, which was not a misrepresentation because he did not know of the policies possessed by his partner.",1,229,231,,

Interest payable on the loan of £14,385 used to purchase the home was calculated under paragraph 7(4) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 to be £28.01. The adjudication officer restricted this amount under paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 3 to £14.65, the amount of the eligible rent immediately before the date of purchase. The housing costs payable were increased as the interest rate on the loan increased until on 1 March 1990 they were £18.60. When interest rates fell the housing costs were reduced until on   1 August 1991 they were £11.44. The claimant appealed to the social security appeal tribunal which upheld the adjudication officers decision to reduce the amount of housing costs payable. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	there is no provision in paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 to reduce the restricted housing costs on a reduction to the interest rate (para. 14);
2.	when the eligible interest calculated under paragraph 7(4) of Schedule 3 falls below the restricted amount then the amount payable will be the eligible interest (para. 25);

He was sponsored by a family friend in the United Kingdom with whom he stayed until November 1988 when he moved to Sheffield. He claimed income support in November 1988 because his familys assets had been frozen following the outbreak of war in Somalia. His family had fled to Ethiopia and were last known to be in a refugee camp. He was paid income support as a person from abroad.
On 8 March 1990 the adjudication officer determined that the claimant, who was by then 17 years old and had been granted further leave to remain in the United Kingdom, was not entitled to benefit because he was to be treated as engaged in relevant education and was not estranged from his parents. Visas had been issued authorising his parents to enter the United Kingdom but they were unable to finance the journey. On appeal, the tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision.

Money for the building of the new home was obtained on an overdraft from Lloyds Bank. When the claimant moved into the property in April 1990 the overdraft was £73,717. This continued to increase, as final accounts connected with the building were paid, until by June 1990 it was £82,933.56.

The claimants appealed against the initial awards of income support. In CSIS/28/1992, the social security appeal tribunal decided that the claimant was entitled to severe disability premium until 9 October 1989 but not thereafter because the claimants mother was excluded from the amended definition of non-dependant in regulation 3 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.

2.	it was necessary to have regard to each of the appeals in the context of the five amendments made to regulation 3 of the regulations during the period under consideration;
3.	as a matter of Scots Law, an incapax cannot enter into contracts on his own behalf:
(i)	it was therefore necessary for adjudicating authorities to determine whether a claimant was so mentally incapacitated as to be incapax as understood in Scots Law;
(ii)	if so it was then necessary to consider the Scots Law doctrines of recompense and negotiorum gestio. Relying on the doctrine of recompense, the parents of an incapax adult might reclaim monies expended by them in maintaining the incapax. For that it would be necessary to show that the expenditure was not incurred ex pietate or animo donandi. It must be equitable for the incapax to make recompense. It was doubtful if reclamation could be based on the doctrine of negotiorum gestio but the tribunal of Commissioners did not exclude the possibility;
4.	this result under Scots Law was not dissimilar to that under English Law in CIS/195/1991;
5.	the words commercial basis govern the nature of the liability and not the quality of the payments made. Adjudicating authorities should consider whether the payments were broadly in line with what a lodger might be expected to pay for the accommodation and facilities offered.",1,172,,,

On 21 October 1988, the claimant claimed mobility allowance. In the light of a medical practitioners report, the adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to mobility allowance. This decision was confirmed by a medical board and the claimant appealed against the boards decision to a medical appeal tribunal (MAT). The MAT found that the claimant did not satisfy the medical conditions for an award of mobility allowance, but this decision was set aside under regulation 11 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986. The case was reheard on 27 April 1992 by a disability appeal tribunal (DAT) who decided that the claimant was not entitled to mobility allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. a DAT is not a specialist tribunal in the sense that a MAT is and while it adjudicates on medical questions, it does not do so with the medical expertise of a MAT. Although the law requires that one of the DAT members is a medical practitioner, that members role is to use their specialist knowledge in interpreting the evidence heard by the tribunal since they are precluded from conducting a walking test or undertaking a medical examination of the claimant (para. 9);
2. DATs should approach medical questions in the same way as the statutory authorities and not as the adjudicating medical authorities do. This means that a DAT has to decide the case on the material presented to them and, if there is a conflict of medical opinion, the members have to evaluate the evidence and decide on a balance of probabilities what evidence to accept and what to reject. Jones v. Secretary of State [1972] 1 All ER 150 followed (para. 9);
3. the general test of adequacy of reasons given by social security appeal tribunals, as set out in Commissioners decisions R(SB) 6/81 and R(SB) 11/82, applies equally to decisions of DATs. So where the DAT decides that one of the conflicting medical opinions is to be preferred to the other, it should say why it prefers such opinion. Where the medical evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant has been rejected it is necessary for the DAT to give some reason for its rejection (para. 10).

The claimant was a child aged 10, diagnosed as suffering from Aspergers Syndrome and autism. He was awarded the lowest rate of the care component and the lower rate of the mobility component until 25 January 1999. An adjudication officer subsequently revised the award of the care component to one at the highest rate terminating on 12 April 2001. The claimant unsuccessfully appealed to a tribunal on the grounds that he satisfied the conditions of entitlement to the higher rate of the mobility component in section 73(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The claimant then appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the tribunal should have revised the award of the lower rate of the mobility component to terminate on the same date on which the care component was to terminate, to comply with section 71(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992;
2. findings and reasons in relation to regulation 12(5) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 (severely mentally impaired) were inadequate;
3. limb (c) of regulation 12(6) (severe behavioural problems), requiring another person to be present and watching over him whenever he is awake, is satisfied only if the constant presence of an adult is necessary in order to intervene if and when the claimant actually becomes disruptive;
4. that limb is not satisfied if the structured regime of a school, or the presence of the claimants mother, is of itself sufficient to prevent the claimant becoming disruptive;
5. the requirements of limbs (b) and (c) indicate that the watching over must be needed both within the home and outside it, and whether or not the claimant is seeking to take advantage of the faculty of mobility.

The Commissioner decided that on the tribunals findings in relation to regulation 12(6), the claimant was not entitled to the higher rate of the mobility component, and gave his own decision. In effect the Commissioner awarded the highest rate of the care component, and lower rate of the mobility component, for the same fixed period.",1,82,,,

The claimant was paid invalid care allowance on the basis that he was looking after his severely disabled mother and that he met the conditions of entitlement in section 70(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The claimant failed to disclose that his mother had been admitted to hospital as an in-patient on two occasions. An adjudication officer determined that the mother had not been entitled to attendance allowance for certain periods because of her admissions to hospital. An adjudication officer then determined that the claimant had been overpaid invalid care allowance because he had received it during those periods. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which upheld the adjudication officers decision on the basis that the claimants mother was not a severely disabled person within the meaning of section 70(2) of the Act when she was not entitled to attendance allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who decided that he was to be treated under regulation 4 of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 as looking after a severely disabled person for a further period of eight weeks because those were weeks in which the regulation stated that its requirements were to be treated as satisfied even though his mother was in hospital. The Secretary of  State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. section 70(2) of the Act exclusively provides for the definition of severely disabled person;
2. regulation 4(1) deals with the meaning of section 70(1)(a) and is not intended to involve any departure from the statutory definition above;
3. there is no conflict or inconsistency between regulation 4(2) and section 70(2) with its statutory definition;

The claimant was a married woman who did not satisfy the contribution conditions for a Category A retirement pension. In June 1980 she became entitled to a graduated retirement benefit of £0.36 per week. In January 1981 her husband reached pensionable age (65) but deferred his retirement. He retired in June 1985 and became entitled to a Category A pension and the claimant then became entitled to a Category B pension. The adjudication officer decided that because the claimant was in receipt of graduated retirement benefit, the days in the period January 1981 to June 1985 were not days of increment and accordingly the claimant was not entitled to an increased rate of Category B pension by virtue of her husbands deferment of retirement.

The Commissioner held that:
1.	the claimant was not precluded by regulation 4(1)(b) of the Social Security (Widows Benefit and Retirement Pensions) Regulations 1979 (SI 1979/642) from entitlement to increment to her Category B pension for those days in respect of which she received graduated retirement pension;
2.	regulation 3 of the Social Security (Graduated Retirement Benefits) (No. 2) Regulations 1978 (SI 1978/393) had the effect of preserving entitlement to graduated retirement pension.

The claimant, a resident of the Republic of Ireland, was aged 65 on 22 February 1985 and was awarded retirement pension. After attempts in September 1987 to confirm that the claimants circumstances were unchanged had failed, payment of retirement pension was suspended from 28 December 1987. Further enquiries ensued but no reply was received until 19 December 1989. The adjudication officer deeded that as the payments for the period between 28 December 1987 and 27 November 1988 had not been obtained within twelve months of the date the right to those payments arose, that right had been extinguished. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who allowed the appeal.
The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the tribunals decision was not wrong in law. The tribunal concluded that regulation 38(2A) of the Claims and Payments Regulations 1987 could have two alternative meanings. The first would require a claimant to satisfy all four of the conditions in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of that regulation. On that interpretation it is a prerequisite that an instrument of payment should have been sent (para. 14). The alternative interpretation was that only a person who has been given or sent an instrument of payment must satisfy the further conditions imposed by sub-paragraphs (c) and (d). If an instrument of payment has not been given or sent, it does not prevent a claimant from being able to benefit from the good cause provisions. The tribunal concluded that the latter meaning was the correct one. Because of the claimants depressive illness, it was accepted that good cause could be shown (R(S) 3/63 confirmed). Any failure by the claimants sister to act timeously could not be attributed to the claimant as there was no appointment for her to act on his behalf (R(SB) 17/83 followed) (para. 14);
2.	the Commissioner agreed with the tribunals interpretation and concluded that only a person who has been given or sent an instrument of payment must satisfy the further conditions imposed by sub-paragraphs (c) and (d). If an instrument of payment has not been given or sent, it does not prevent a claimant from being able to benefit from the good cause provision. In the present case, no instrument of payment had been given or sent but as good cause had been accepted, the tribunal decision was not erroneous in law. As a result, the claimant was entitled to payment of retirement pension from 28 December 1987 (paras. 17 to 19);
3.	it was correct to apply the law in force at the time the adjudication officer made his decision in 1990 rather than that in force when the right to the payments arose between 1987 and 1988 (para. 16).

[Note: Regulations 38(2A) (c) and (d) were amended from 27 September 1993 by SI 1993 No. 2113 to the effect that only those cases where the Secretary of State has certified that either no instrument of payment has been issued and no payment has been made by automated credit transfer, or a previously issued instrument of payment has been returned and no instrument of payment has been issued as a replacement, can benefit from the twelve month extension for good cause.]",1,58,,,

The claimant was in receipt of invalidity benefit which included an increase for his wife. The claimants wife was working but her earnings were below the limit that would have affected payment of the increase. The earnings rule that applied to the claimant was the tapered earnings rule which remained in force in his case by virtue of the transitional protection afforded by regulation 8(6) of the Social Security Benefit (Dependency) Regulations 1977. The claimant reached age 70 on 14 November 1987 and was awarded retirement pension from and including 9 November 1987 together with an increase for his wife. On 7 July 1988 the adjudication officer reviewed the award of the increase of retirement pension on the grounds of error of law namely that the tapered earnings rule ceased to apply when entitlement to invalidity benefit ceased. As the claimants wifes earnings were in excess of the limit set out in regulation 8(2), the adjudication officer decided that the increase of retirement pension in respect of her was not payable. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who upheld the adjudication officers decision.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the transitional protection afforded by regulation 8(6) of the Dependency Regulations 1977 does not cross over from one benefit to another. Where regulation 8(6) uses the words a beneficiary was entitled to an increase of benefit and then the words entitled to that increase, the regulation is referring separately to an increase of invalidity benefit and to an increase of retirement pension (para. 9);
2.	increases of retirement pension and invalidity benefit for a dependent wife are provided for by section 45 of the Social Security Act 1975. Increases of those benefits for a dependent husband are provided for by two separate sections of the Act, section 45A for retirement pension and section 47 for invalidity benefit. The different legislative methods of treating the two increases, for husband and wife respectively, is solely attributable to historical and policy reasons and does not mean that increases of retirement pension and invalidity benefit for a dependent wife were intended to be one and indivisible (para. 13).",1,262,,,

The claimant suffered from multiple sclerosis and angina and was awarded sickness benefit followed by invalidity benefit. Because of the relief to his symptoms he started to spend time in Malta and by the middle of 1982 was spending most of his time there, occasional return visits being made to Great Britain where the claimant maintained a home. The claimant maintained that his status in Malta was that of a temporary or tourist resident whose stay was subject to extensions by the Maltese authorities. It was confirmed with these authorities that the claimant had no right to permanent residence in Malta.
On 2 November 1989 the adjudication officer disqualified the claimant for receiving benefit because he was absent from Great Britain (Social Security Act 1975 section 82(5)(a)). He further decided that the claimant could not benefit from the reciprocal agreement with Malta because the claimant was not temporarily in Malta. On appeal the social security appeal tribunal confirmed the disqualification under section 82(5)(a) but found that the claimant was temporarily in the territory of Malta and therefore entitled to benefit by virtue of Article 9A of the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries (Malta) Order 1958.

Held that:
1.	the claimants expressed wish to return to Great Britain when his health improved was a remote hope rather than a realistic intention. He was not therefore temporarily absent from Great Britain within the meaning of regulation 2(1) of the Social Security Benefit (Persons Abroad) Regulations 1975 (para. 5);
2.	whether a person is resident as opposed to being temporarily in a country is essentially a question of fact and degree. On this basis the Commissioner distinguished decision CS/2/1976 (paras. 11 and 12);
3.	it was reasonable to conclude that by the time his benefit was disallowed in November 1989 the claimant had become permanently resident in Malta. The fact that he had not acquired a legal right to permanent residence in that country was not conclusive (para. 14).

In 1964 she married a British national and acquired British nationality, but also retained her German nationality. Subsequently she came with her husband to live in Great Britain. In 1989 she retired on grounds of ill-health. Sickness benefit was awarded from 1 May 1989 to 11 November 1989. On 6 August 1989 she went to West Germany to see her home, relatives and friends, returning to Great Britain on 9 September 1989. The adjudication officer disqualified the claimant under section 82(5)(a) of the Social Security Act 1975 for receiving sickness benefit from 7 August 1989 to 8 September 1989 because she was absent from Great Britain and the Secretary of State had not certified (pursuant to regulation 2(1)(a) of the Social Security Benefit (Persons Abroad) Regulations) that it was consistent with the proper administration of the Act that the claimant should not be disqualified. The claimant appealed to the social security appeal tribunal who dismissed the appeal.
The claimants appeal to the Commissioner, with the leave of the tribunal chairman, was on the grounds that the decision to disqualify constituted indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality, contrary to Article 7(1) of the EEC Treaty and Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71.

Held that:
1.	the principles applied to indirect discrimination on grounds of sex can be applied to indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality (para. 16);
2.	in deciding whether there is indirect discrimination the pool of comparison is the class of persons who are in receipt of sickness benefit and who are absent from Great Britain but do not come within regulation 2(1) of the Persons Abroad Regulations (para. 16);
3.	section 82(5)(a) of the Social Security Act 1975 and regulation 2(1) of the Persons Abroad Regulations impose no discrimination, direct or indirect, on the grounds of nationality contrary to Article 3.1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 or of Article 7.1 of the EEC Treaty; in particular they do not create a disproportionate impact upon non British EEC nationals compared with British nationals (para. 16);

The claimant was employed as a veterinary assistant and was advised on 28 July 1989 that she was pregnant and that her job was not suitable for her as it would place the baby at risk. After returning from a two week holiday on 15 August 1989 she claimed statutory sick pay. Her doctor stated that it was unwise for her to continue at work during the pregnancy. On 15 August 1989 the claimant had a blood test for toxoplasmosis. The result, that she did not suffer from the disease nor was she immune to it, was given to her on 18 August 1989.

In deciding that the tribunal decision was erroneous in law and that the claimant satisfied the conditions of regulation 2(1)(a) for the period 15 August 1989 to 18 August 1989, the Commissioner held that:
1.	pregnancy of itself is not a specific disease or bodily or mental disablement in terms of social security legislation;
2.	it is not a correct construction of regulation 2(1)(a) to read under medical care in respect of a specific disease or bodily of mental disablement as applying to diseases a claimant could get by contact, in this case toxoplasmosis.

From 18 November 1985 to 22 March 1986 the claimant was awarded and paid maternity allowance. On 20 June 1988 she claimed sickness benefit supported by evidence that she had been incapable of work since 27 March 1986. The adjudication officer allowed backdating to 20 June 1987, but refused the claim on the grounds that the claimant did not satisfy the condition laid down in paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 3 to the Social Security Act 1975 because she had not paid or been credited with sufficient contributions in the relevant past year as defined in paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule.
The adjudication officer proceeded on the basis that the relevant past year was the year ending 5 April 1986 because the period of interruption of employment which included the date of the claim had commenced on 20 June 1987. The claimant contended that there was no rule preventing days of incapacity prior to the date to which the claim had been backdated from forming part of the period of interruption of employment. On that basis the period of interruption of employment had commenced on 18 November 1985 (as the maternity and sickness benefit clams linked) and so the relevant past year was the year ending 5 April 1984 for which the claimants contribution record was sufficient.
The social security appeal tribunal confirmed the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner. The Secretary of State, appearing as a separate party, contended that any dispute over the determination of the relevant past year came within his jurisdiction under section 93(1)(b) of the Act, which provided that the questions to be determined by the Secretary of State included a question whether the contribution conditions to any benefit are satisfied or otherwise relating to a persons contributions or his earnings factor.
Mr. Commissioner Goodman held that (a) although the Secretary of State had jurisdiction to determine matters arising under paragraphs 1(2) and 1(3) of the Schedule, matters arising under paragraph 1(4) fell to be determined by the adjudicating authorities (a conclusion which he based on the decision of a tribunal of Commissioners, R(G) 1/82); and (b) days of incapacity prior to the date to which the claim had been backdated could not form part of the period of interruption of employment. He therefore rejected the appeal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal on the jurisdiction issue.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Secretary of State had exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising under paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 to the Social Security Act 1975. Paragraph 1(4) did no more than contain definitions for the purposes of paragraphs 1(2) and 1(3). Therefore the functions allotted to the Secretary of State by section 93(1)(b) of the Act, the language of which was quite general, necessarily included those of applying those definitions and of determining any questions that might arise in the course of such application;
2.	in so far as decision R(G) 1/82 was based on the proposition that questions arising under paragraph 1(4) of the Schedule did not fall to be determined by the Secretary of State, it was wrongly decided.
The Court set aside the Commissioners decision and ordered that the question of the date on which the period of interruption of employment which included the sickness benefit claim commenced should be referred to the Secretary of State for determination. The Commissioner should make a fresh decision on the appeal in the light of that determination",1,76,283,,

Held that:

2.	the claimant cannot be helped by articles 22(1)(b) and (c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 because there was no authorisation by the Secretary of State (para. 9);
3.	the claimant only had immediate benefits on the day that he was in hospital (28 June 1990) and the subsequent days on which he took the prescribed medication were not days on which his condition required immediate benefits (para. 11);
4.	where a persons condition necessitates immediate benefits in kind when in the territory of another Member State, he is entitled, for the period only of needing those benefits, to cash benefits (e.g. sickness benefit) as well (para. 17);
5.	the claimant is not entitled to sickness benefit for 28 June 1990 because, although on that day his condition necessitated immediate benefits during the stay in the territory of another Member State, that day was the first of the first three days of the period of interruption of employment (Social Security Act 1975, sections l4(3) and 17(1)(d)).

Held that:

The adjudication officer reviewed the claimants award of invalidity benefit on the ground that two different departmental doctors had assessed her as capable of work albeit within certain limits. A tribunal dismissed the claimants appeal, holding that the new medical opinions constituted a relevant change of circumstances for the purposes of section 104(1)(b) of the Social Security Act 1975 and also that the claimant had failed to prove that she was incapable of work. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner, contending that the tribunal had erred in relying on job descriptions that were out of date and impractical.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the adjudication officers decision was erroneous in law as it was well established that a new or different medical opinion could not of itself constitute a relevant change of circumstances;
2.	there were no other relevant circumstances in this case and therefore the review should not have taken place under section 104(1)(b) of the Social Security Act 1975 but under regulation 17(4) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987;

The claimant was receiving invalidity benefit and an increase of invalidity benefit in respect of his wife. On attaining age 60 his wife claimed retirement pension, which was payable from 3 March 1986. Her retirement pension included three elements, basic pension, additional pension, and graduated retirement benefit. The adjudication officer deducted the whole of the retirement pension from the increase of invalidity benefit otherwise payable. This decision was upheld by the social security appeal tribunal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held that:
although the graduated retirement benefit was not deductible from the increase of invalidity benefit in respect of the claimants wife (para. 7), such was not the case as regards her basic pension or her additional pension. These two pensions had to be deducted (paras. 9 and 10).

The claimant had received invalidity benefit including an increase for his wife continuously since 19 April 1982. He was therefore entitled to the benefit of the transitional protection applying to the tapered earnings rule for determining the amount of increase payable (regulation 8(6) of the Social Security Benefit (Dependency) Regulations 1977). On 4 July 1989 his wifes trade union called a strike and she was involved in one day strikes on 4 July 1989, 11 July 1989, 18 July 1989 and 20 July 1989. This came to light when the claimant notified his local office in October 1989 of an increase in his wifes wages. As a result the adjudication officer reviewed the award of an increase of invalidity benefit and decided that there was no entitlement to the increase for 4 July 1989, 11 July 1989, 18 July 1989 and 20 July 1989. As a break in entitlement causes the claimant to lose the right to have the tapered earnings rule applied, the adjudication officer also decided that no increase was payable from and including 5 July 1989 due to the fact that the earnings of the claimants wife in the previous week exceeded the limit permitted by the all or nothing earnings rule (regulation 8(2) of the Social Security Benefit (Dependency) Regulations 1977) and had continued to do so. The revised decision resulted in an overpayment of benefit from 4 July 1989 to 3 March 1990. The adjudication officer determined that the overpayment from 4 July 1989 to 22 October 1989 was recoverable from the claimant on the grounds that he failed to disclose a material fact. The claimant appealed.

Held that:

The claimant, a British national, last worked in the United Kingdom during 1964 -1965. In 1973 she moved to Belgium where she worked until 1982 when she suffered a spastic hemiplegia which confined her to a wheelchair. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1985 and was refused severe disablement allowance following a claim made in 1986. The tribunal dismissed her appeal on the basis that she did not satisfy the residence conditions of regulation 3 of the Social Security (Severe Disablement Allowance) Regulations 1984 since she had not been resident in Great Britain for ten of the 20 years preceding her application for severe disablement allowance. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner arguing that Article 71(1)(b)(ii) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 entitled her to severe disablement allowance because she was an employed person, other than a frontier worker, who is wholly unemployed and who makes [her]self available for work to the employment services in the territory of the Member State in which [s]he resides or who returns to that territory. She submitted that she had returned to the Member State in which she resided and hence was entitled to receive benefits in the United Kingdom in accordance with the legislation of the United Kingdom as if she had been employed there. The Commissioner referred a number of questions to the European Court of Justice.

Held, that:
1.	the determining factor as to whether Article 71 applies at all is the residence of the person concerned in a Member State other than that to whose legislation he was subject during his last employment;
2.	it follows that the first sentence of Article 71(1)(b)(ii) does not apply to a worker in the position of the claimant who was resident in the State of employment (Belgium) when the incapacity of work followed by invalidity occurred; and
3.	under Article 86 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and Article 35, Regulation 574/72 the institution of the State of residence is required to forward a claim for invalidity benefit submitted to it to the competent institution of the State of last employment; it is not, on the other hand, required to pay such benefit to the claimant",1,119,,,

He continued to claim supplementary benefit and was put on to quarterly signing in February 1983. The long term scale rate was awarded from 4 June 1984.
On 26 June 1989 the claimant asked for a review of his supplementary benefit. He said that he had suffered from peripheral vascular inefficiency since 1979 and should have been awarded the long term scale rate from the start of his claim in July 1979. The adjudication officer reviewed the original decision on the grounds that it had been made in ignorance of the fact that the claimant had health problems, but decided that regulation 72 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986 was not satisfied and so arrears could not be paid. On appeal the tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

The Commissioner, in considering the conditions of regulation 72(1)(a), held:
1.	it was for the claimant to make the point concerning his health to the visiting officer. The regulation does not impose a duty on officers to interrogate claimants as to every conceivable circumstance which might affect their award (para. 6);
2.	the mistake envisaged by the regulation is a clear and obvious mistake made by the officer of the Department on the facts disclosed to him or which he had reason to believe were relevant (para. 6);
3.	the tribunal were right to bear in mind that if the claimant were to show that a mistake had been made, it must also be shown that he had not caused or materially contributed to that mistake (para. 6).

The claimant had been receiving income support since 11 April 1988. On 18 February 1991 she claimed a single payment for the cost of clothing under regulation 24 of the Supplementary Benefit (Urgent Cases) Regulations 1981. The AO refused the claim on the grounds that the provisions of the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976 and regulations made thereunder had been repealed from 11 April 1988. On appeal to the tribunal the claimant contended that regulation 49(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (SI 1987 No. 1968) preserved the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976 and relative regulations for any claim for supplementary benefit whether made before or after the repeal of the Act. The tribunal confirmed the AOs decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner who upheld the tribunals decision.

Held that:
1.	construing the provisions of regulation 49(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations as applying to all claims for supplementary benefit made after 11 April 1988 relating to dates, periods, events or circumstances arising after that date would create immediate inconsistency, amounting to repugnancy, with the repeal of the Supplementary Benefits Act 1976, which was effective from the same date (para. 8);
2.	the consequence of the claimants argument would mean the perpetuation of the whole supplementary benefits scheme which the Social Security Act 1986 repealed and replaced with the income support and social fund schemes. These grossly anomalous consequences should be avoided. The reference in regulation 49(1) to the continuing availability of claims for supplementary benefit should be construed as referring to claims made after 11 April 1988 relating to periods before that date. This construction is consistent with section 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 safeguarding accrued rights, and section 16(1)(e) preserving remedies in respect of such rights (para. 9).

The claimant was employed by a company which introduced short time working at the end of November 1989. The claimant claimed unemployment benefit for her non working days from            6 December 1989 onwards. She was issued with postal claim forms (UB25PF) by her employer, on which an official at the local benefit office had entered the following dates of claim:

10 December 1989 to 23 December 1989
24 December 1989 to   6 January 1990

The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to benefit for the days on which she was unemployed from and including                 11 December 1989. This was because her earnings in the relevant seven day periods ending on a Saturday were in excess of the lower earnings limit as provided for by reg 7(l)(o) of the SS(U, S&IVB) Regs 1983, which came into effect on 10 December 1989. The social security appeal tribunal upheld the disentitlement. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. There was no dispute as to the days of employment, or the amount of earnings. The sole issue to be decided was whether or not the claimant had been notified in writing of a weekday for the purpose of claiming UB.

Held that:
1.	it was important that the claimant be given a clear and proper notice from or on behalf of the Secretary of State. The claim forms issued by the employer could not be regarded as the appropriate statutory notice and therefore no notice had in fact been given (para. 10);

In allowing the appeal the Commissioner held that:
1.	an attendance allowance payable to a councillor was still to be treated as earnings even though there had been new local government legislation since R(U) 6/77 and R(U) 5/83;

The scheme was modified in the case of redundancy to allow for an enhanced pension, payable immediately, if the employee was aged 50 or above. The claimant contended that the enhanced pension benefit paid to him was not an occupational pension within section 30 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 because the scheme under which it was paid was nothing more than a redundancy scheme. The adjudication officer decided that the claimants entitlement to unemployment benefit should be abated by taking into account the amount of the claimants enhanced pension benefit as an occupational pension (£62 per week). The SSAT upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner who set aside the decision of the tribunal on the grounds that it breached regulation 25(2)(b) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986, but substituted his own decision to the same effect.

Calculation of earnings of self-employed earner - seasonal worker - whether ""gainfully employed"" during the ""off"" season

The claimant worked as a self-employed seasonal worker and had been doing so for some years, working from July to November. On 10 November 1999 he claimed jobseeker's allowance. The Secretary of State decided that the claimant should be treated as ""gainfully employed"" throughout the year from July 1999 and that his earnings should therefore be taken into account under regulation 95(1)(a) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 by calculating a weekly average over the whole year.  The claimant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that he should not be treated as ""gainfully employed"" when it was uncertain whether he would obtain a licence the following year.  The tribunal allowed his appeal only to the extent of reducing the amount of the earnings to be taken into account.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.  The Secretary of State supported the appeal insofar as he submitted that the tribunal had failed to disregard £5 of the earnings and had incorrectly calculated the weekly amount of the earnings by dividing the amount of annual earnings by 52. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	it was clear that the tribunal had intended to produce a figure for earnings before any disregard was applied and that the decision had been interpreted in that way (paragraph 4);
2.	in calculating the weekly amount of earnings of self-employed earners, it was preferable to divide annual earnings by 365 and multiply the result by 7 but it was not an error of law to divide annual earnings by 52, at any rate where the difference that made was as small as in this case (9p p.w) and the amount of annual earnings was itself a ""rough"" figure (paragraph 4);
3.	following CIS/422/95, in the case of a seasonal worker there was likely to be a cycle of work of a year, in which case the claimant would be treated as engaged in ""work for which payment is made or which is done in expectation of payment"" throughout the cycle so that, if he was engaged in such work on average for not less than 16 hours a week, he would be treated under regulation 51 as being in remunerative work and not entitled to jobseeker's allowance throughout the year  (paragraph 10);
4.	a person was ""gainfully employed"" when engaged in ""work for which payment is made or which is done in expectation of payment"" and therefore, if a seasonal worker was engaged in such work on average for less than 16 hours a week over a year and thus might be entitled to jobseeker's allowance throughout the year, his earnings were to be taken into account over the year under regulation 95 (paragraph 12);
5.	the tribunal had been entitled to consider that the claimant was a seasonal worker on the ground that since a licence had always been granted before one was likely to be granted again and, assuming in the claimant's favour that the average number of hours he had worked in the relevant year was less than 16, the tribunal had not erred in taking his earnings into account (paragraphs 14 and 15).",1,216,235,,

The claimant was a married man with eleven children, eight of whom were dependant. He owned two three-bedroomed houses in the same street, separated from each other by two other houses. On 11 February 2000 he claimed income-based jobseeker's allowance, which was refused on the ground that the capital value of only one house could be disregarded as ""the dwelling occupied as the home"" under regulation 108(2) of and Schedule 8 paragraph 1 to the Jobseeker's Regulations 1996. He appealed on the basis that both houses were occupied as one dwelling. The tribunal decided that there was no provision for the value of the claimant's second house to be disregarded and dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed and the Commissioner held that the ""dwelling occupied as the home"" might comprise more than one building, but remitted the case to a fresh tribunal to make findings of fact as to the extent of the use of the second house by the claimant and his dependent children. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. By the time the appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal a second tribunal had accepted evidence that the second house was occupied by the claimant and his family, and it had been conceded by the Secretary of State that there would be statutory overcrowding if the claimant and his family were to occupy only one of the houses. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the expansion of the word ""dwelling"" into the phrase ""dwelling occupied as the home"" gave the impression that the legislature had intended to convey its function as a home for the claimant rather than its bricks and mortar and that home was not necessarily confined to a single building (paragraph 26);

2.	a test for determining whether two buildings were one home was to ask whether one house was, in effect, used as an annex of the other, or to put it another way, whether it was a single home on a split site (following R(SB) 10/89) (paragraph 27);

3.	applying that test a decision-maker could with commonsense determine what a claimant was using as his home. It was the place where he lived, where he ate, slept, bathed, relaxed, and which he enjoyed with his family (paragraph 32);

Regulation 9(5) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1979, which was revoked with effect from 1988, stated that a claim for supplementary benefit ""may"" also be treated as a claim for attendance allowance.   Both claimants, C and N, had been severely disabled since the early 1980's.  Both had applied for supplementary benefit, but not attendance allowance, prior to the revocation of the regulations.   In the early 1990's both claimants applied for attendance allowance and asked for their claims to be back-dated to the date of their first application for supplementary benefit.  The Secretary of State considered that, since the revocation of 1979 Regulations, he had not had power to treat claims for supplementary benefit as claims for attendance allowance.  C's application for judicial review was dismissed by Harrison J.  The adjudication officer's refusal to award attendance allowance to N was upheld by a tribunal but a Commissioner allowed his appeal and, holding that the Secretary of State still had power to treat N's claim for supplementary benefit as a claim for attendance allowance, directed that the question whether that power should be exercised should be referred to the Secretary of State.  C appealed against Harrison J's decision and the Chief Adjudication Officer appealed against the Commissioner's decision in N's case.

Held, dismissing C's appeal and allowing the Chief Adjudication Officer's appeal, that:

1. 	the power to treat a claim for supplementary benefit as a claim for attendance allowance had been only discretionary and therefore no rights that might have been preserved by section 16 of the Interpretation Act 1978 had accrued to the claimants and the power could no longer be exercised;

2.	by section 95(1)(e) of the Social Security Act 1975, adjudication under section 80 was allocated to the Secretary of State and it followed that the Commissioner had had no jurisdiction to determine the issue arising before him.",1,51,60,,

The claimant had previously been awarded attendance allowance at the higher rate but on a renewal claim made when she was eight years old only a lower rate certificate was issued.  On review the DMP decided that that certificate should be revoked on the ground that although the claimant displayed bizarre behaviour, her symptoms were behavioural in origin and she did not suffer from a severe mental or physical disability at all.  On appeal it was contended that the claimant was plainly suffering from mental disablement and she should not be refused benefit just because there was no identified disease of the brain to which the cause of her conduct could be attributed.

Held that:

whether a person is suffering from a mental or physical disablement is a matter for the medical authorities alone.  They were entitled to come to a conclusion that bizarre conduct may not be caused by any ""disability"" but be due to some other medically recognised reason.  The term ""behavioural in origin"" was clearly one that could properly be used in medical diagnosis.  It was not for a Commissioner to trespass upon a question of medical expertise by purporting to treat it as a question of law.

The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal who on 17 February 1994 dismissed her appeal (Re H (a Minor)). The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the DMP had found, and intended to find, that the psychological condition from which the claimant was suffering did not (rather than ""could not"") amount to mental disability.  The Court agreed with the Commissioner that no question of law was involved and the matter was one for the medical judgment of the DMP on the medical evidence before him.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal appears as an appendix to this decision.",1,82,83,,

Cockburn v. Chief Adjudication Officer",,"Attendance allowance - need for extra domestic laundry as a result of disability - whether amounted to attention in connection with bodily functions

Care component - profoundly deaf claimant - whether assistance or attention to enable claimant to live a normal life was reasonably required

Mrs. Cockburn was awarded attendance allowance at the lower rate by a disability appeal tribunal on the basis that her attendance needs for dressing and undressing and getting into and out of bed, when added to laundry generated by her disability, amounted to frequent attention throughout the day. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner allowed the appeal and the claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the House of Lords.
Miss Fairey, aged 20 at the date of the decision of the Commissioner, was profoundly deaf. It had earlier been conceded that she had satisfied the day attention condition for an award of attendance allowance until 16 August 1990 when she turned 16 and the Commissioner had given an interim decision to that effect. The resumed hearing concerned entitlement from when the claimant turned 16 and had been postponed at the request of the Secretary of State pending the outcome in the House of Lords of Mallinson v. Secretary of State for Social Security [1994] WLR 630 [R(A) 3/94]. At the resumed hearing it was not in issue that the attention required because of a claimants hearing loss was or might be attention in connection with the bodily function of hearing or communication.

Held, by the Commissioner, allowing the appeal, that: 
it was right to include in the aggregate of attention that is reasonably required such attention as may enable the claimant to carry out a reasonable level of social activity.

The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, which (by a majority) upheld the decision of the Commissioner. The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, by the House of Lords, dismissing both appeals (in the case of Mrs. Cockburn, by a majority, Lord Slynn of Hadley dissenting), that:

1.	in the case of Miss Fairey, per Lord Slynn of Hadley, (i) the operation of the senses is a bodily function; (ii) the provision of an interpreter to use sign language is capable of providing attention; and (iii) there is no requirement that the attention must be essential or necessary for life or that attention must not be taken into account if it is merely desirable, and that the test is whether the attention is reasonably required to enable the disabled person as far as reasonably possible to live a normal life;

2.	in the case of Mrs. Cockburn, per Lord Hope of Craighead, adopting the formulation of Mr. Commissioner Monroe in CA/60/1974 approved of by Lord Bridge in In re Woodling [1984] WLR 348 [also reported as appendix 2 to R(A) 2/80], at 352H-353B that the statutory criteria are directed primarily to those functions which the fit man normally performs for himself, the help received by the appellant with her extra laundry is help in connection with a task, such as cooking, shopping or keeping the house clean, which the fit person need not, and frequently does not, perform for himself.

In February 1996 the claimant received a decision that he was entitled to invalid care allowance (""ICA"") from 20 June 1995 but that, by virtue of regulation 4 of the Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979 (""the Overlapping Benefits Regulations""), it was not payable because he was receiving incapacity benefit at a higher rate. Incapacity benefit was terminated with effect from 12 May 2000, but the ICA section were unaware of this and did not resume payment. The claimant, who was seeking to have his incapacity benefit reinstated, did not notify the ICA section until his incapacity benefit appeal had been finally turned down, when he returned a routine enquiry form to the ICA section. Payment of the allowance was then resumed with effect from 27 March 2001, the date the enquiry form was received. The claimant appealed, seeking payment from 12 May 2000. The tribunal agreed with the Secretary of State that the decision to resume payment was a supersession decision under section 10 of the Social Security Act 1998, and therefore subject to regulation 7 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, by which such a decision has effect only from the date it was applied for.

The Commissioner held that the decision to withhold payment was a decision under section 8 of the Social Security Act, but that to resume payment it was not necessary to supersede it under section 10. The Secretary of State's authority to withhold payment on the subsisting award of invalid care allowance had ceased when the claimant ceased to receive incapacity benefit at a higher rate, so that regulation 4 of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations no longer applied. The decision to resume payment fell to be made under section 8(1)(c) (a decision falling to be made under or by virtue of a relevant enactment) and should have been to the effect that invalid care allowance had been payable to the claimant from and including 12 May 2000, in accordance with his continuing entitlement. It was not subject to the restrictions applying to superseding decisions.

The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal it was common ground that both the suspension and restoration of the claimant's invalid care allowance involved a decision and not merely an administrative step. The single issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the decision to resume payment was a decision under section 10 or under section 8.

Held, dismissing the appeal and affirming the decision of the Commissioner, that:

1.	an ""award"" of benefit signifies an extant decision that the claimant is entitled to it, and unless there is some legal inhibition on payment of it, payment follows as of right: here there was no such inhibition after 11 May 2000 (paragraph 17);

2.	it was more in conformity with the legislative scheme to regard the decision to resume payment as one under section 8 on a claim for a relevant benefit or falling to be made under the enactments which had so far created an entitlement but had inhibited payment, rather than as a decision under section 10 to supersede the decision not to pay while payment was inhibited (paragraph 18);

3.	to allocate a decision to resume payment to section 10 or to place upon the claimant an onus to inform the Department of its own decision which could not be found in the legislation would penalise him for the Department's own failure to readjust the payments according to law and would tend to defeat the objectives of the scheme (paragraphs 19 and 20);

4.	accordingly the claimant was entitled as of right to resumption of payment of his invalid care allowance with effect from 12 May 2000 because the decision to resume payment was one under section 8, and should have been given effect from that date.",1,258,,,

The review decision on both the conditions contained in Section 4(2) of the Act was expressed in a single sentence which repeated the statutory language of both conditions prefaced by the words . on the evidence I am not satisfied that ..

On a review of the decision awarding family credit the adjudication officer decided that the weekly income of both the claimant and her partner should include an amount of £12 in respect of their free accommodation.  The claimant was therefore not entitled to family credit.  The tribunal in allowing her appeal decided that Regulation 19(3) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 did not require £12 to be taken into account in respect of both of them and awarded family credit of £7.98 per week from 7.6.88.  the adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner initially in relation to the operation of Regulation 19(3) but, in response to the claimants observations, substituted as the leading grounds of appeal the issue of engagement and normal engagement in remunerative work.

Section 110(1) of the Social Security Act 1975 provides for review by a medical board if satisfied by fresh evidence that the decision was given in ignorance of or was based on a mistake as to a material fact.  On appeal from a decision of a medical board refusing to review, the Medical Appeal Tribunal, at the invitation of the Secretary of State, found that there was fresh evidence, but having considered that evidence reached the same conclusion on the facts as the initial medical board.  On appeal the Commissioner (in decision on Commissioners file No CI 198/85) held that the decision of the Medical Appeal Tribunal was erroneous in law, and there were no grounds on which the Medical Appeal Tribunal were entitled to review the decision of the initial medical board.  The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

On 15 January 1988 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held:

In supporting the decision of the Commissioner that the tribunal has properly set out their reasons for their decision and their findings as to the speed, manner and distance the claimant could walk without severe discomfort, the Court of Appeal in Barron v the Secretary of State stated it would be an intolerable burden for a tribunal to have to make specific findings as to the distance which a claimant could walk without having to stop or the extent of the breathlessness and pain which caused him to do so.

Application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against a ruling of the Social Security Commissioner.

On 18 June 1981 the supplementary benefit officer refused the claimants application for a single payment under regulation 9 of the Supplementary Benefit (Single Payments) Regulations 1980.

The claimant appealed.  On 27 August 1981 the supplementary benefits appeal tribunal dismissed the claimants appeal.  On 16 November 1981 the claimant applied to the Social Security Commissioner for leave to appeal on a question of law from the said decision of the supplementary benefits appeal tribunal.  On 30 March 1982 the Commissioner refused leave to appeal to the Commissioner.

The claimant then applied to the Social Security Commissioner for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Commissioner's refusal of leave to appeal to the Commissioner.

On 27 July 1982 the Commissioner refused to grant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to grant such leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Commissioners refusal of leave to appeal to the Commissioner.  By notice of motion dated 13 October 1982 the claimant moved the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from the refusal of the Commissioner dated 30 March 1982.

Held by the Court of Appeal (Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls; Lord Justice Kerr and Sir Sebag Shaw) that the claimants application be dismissed because the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction.

Single Payments  Miscellaneous furniture and Household Equipment needs.

On 28.8.86, the claimant claimed a single payment for various household items, including curtains and floor covering.  The SSAT upheld the adjudication officers decision that the claimant qualified for a single payment of £125 in accordance with Regulation 10A of, and Schedule 1B to, the Single Payments Regulations.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that she was entitled to a larger sum pursuant to Regulation 18 or 30 of the Single Payments Regulations.  A Tribunal of Commissioners duly heard the claimants appeal.

Held that:

	1.  as a matter of necessity, pronouncements on common provisions by the Court of Appeal in England or the Court of Session in Scotland must be followed by all Commissioners in Great Britain (paragraph 12);

	2.  the Commissioners of Great Britain are not bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland and likewise the Commissioners of Northern Ireland are not bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal in England or the Court of Session in Scotland (paragraph 13);

	3.  identically worded provisions operating in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain should be interpreted uniformly.  It is within the contemplation of Parliament that the same social security system should within limits operate both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain, and in pursuance thereof it would be natural to suppose that the same interpretation should be given throughout the United Kingdom to identically worded provisions.  Accordingly it was incumbent upon the Tribunal of Commissioners to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland (in Carleton v Department of Health and Social Services) rather than that of the Tribunal of Commissioners in England in R(SB)10/88, particularly as the decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland was unanimous and notwithstanding that the Court chose not to have R/SB10/88 argued (paragraph 15);

	4.  the phrase miscellaneous furniture and household equipment needs in Regulation 10A falls to be interpreted in a broad, common-sense way, and can embrace a claim for both a single item, and a variety of items.  Any such need falls outside Regulation 30 (paragraphs 20 to 21);

	5.  the need for either curtains or carpets on any significant scale could not be regarded as a simple measure to reduce draughts within the meaning of Regulation 18 of the Single Payments Regulations.

	Once there is a need (whatever it might be) for a particular item falling within Regulation 10A the claim can only be brought within that Regulation whatever the reason why the particular item is required (paragraphs 17, 21 and 22).

The appeal was dismissed.

NOTES

	(a)  The Commissioners also heard the appeal at file number CSB 947/88.  The issues were in all material respects the same, except that the claimant was unable to qualify for an award under Regulation 10A.  The Commissioners held that this had no effect and further consideration under Regulation 30 was similarly precluded.

	(b)  The Commissioners were primarily concerned with items falling within the ambit of Regulation 10A (paragraphs 8 and 9).  The wider effect of the Court of Appeal (NI) judgment  that items defined as essential by Regulation 9 of the Single Payments Regulations, are similarly precluded from Regulation 30  is specifically considered by the Commissioner in R(SB) 2/90.",1,69,,,

Part-time teacher-recognised or customary holiday-effect on all days in school holiday.

The claimant, employed as a temporary part-time teacher for about 6½ hours over two days a week, did not work over the school Christmas holidays and claimed unemployment benefit for that period.  His salary was spread uniformly over the entire period of the contract and represented 13/55 of a full-time teachers salary.  The adjudication officer concluded that unemployment benefit was not payable for the holiday period because all of the days in that period were days of recognised or customary holiday within regulation 7(1)(h) of the Social Security (Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit) Regulations 1983, (per the decision of a Tribunal of Commissioners in R(U) 18/64.  The social security appeal tribunal upheld the decision of the adjudication officer.  On the claimants appeal to a Commissioner the Chief Commissioner directed that the matter be heard by a Tribunal of Commissioners which could consider whether they were bound by the decision of the earlier Tribunal of Commissioners.

Held that:

	1.  in determining whether to be bound by a decision of a previous Tribunal of Commissioners a Tribunal of Commissioners should adopt and adapt the principles laid down in the Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) of the House of Lords reported at [1966] 1 WLR 1234, as had the Industrial Relations Court in Chapman v Goonvean and Rostowrack China Clay Co., Ltd [1973] ICR 50 at p. 58; it should not adopt the principles laid down in Young v Bristol Aeroplane Company Ltd [1944] KB 718 approved by the House of Lords in Davis v Johnson [1979] AC 264 (paragraphs 5 to 17);

	2.  applying those principles, the Tribunal of Commissioners should not disturb and should follow the decision of the earlier Tribunal of Commissioners in decision R(U) 18/64 whereby the words in regulation 7(1)(h) recognised or customary holiday in connection with an employment apply to the periods of holiday at the establishment in question, so that in the present case all of the days in the school holiday and not merely those days on which in term time the claimant would have worked were precluded by regulation 7(1)(h) from being days of unemployment (paragraphs 18 to 28).",1,69,,,

The claimant had been in business as a self-employed person for many years. Having experienced financial difficulties, by January 2000 his property had become subject to the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 and, on 26 January 2000, he made a claim for income support. Applying regulation 42 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, the decision maker treated as ""notional income"" periodical payments made from a pension annuity policy which the claimant had previously taken out, but which, by virtue of the claimant's affairs falling under the Insolvency Act 1986, were compulsorily applied in their entirety to the benefit of the claimant's creditors. The claimant appealed to the tribunal. The tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal and found that he had no entitlement to income support. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the general principle that in an insolvency commencing before the coming into force of section 11(1) of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 such payments belong beneficially to the creditors (Re Landau [1998] Ch. 223, Krasner v Dennison [2001] Ch. 76) overrides the decision in CIS/212/1989 that they are the insolvent's income for income support purposes - R(IS) 4/02 approved (paragraphs 4 and 5);
2.	the payments were not notional income of the claimant under regulation 42 as payments made to a third party ""in respect of"" the claimant, since in this context that expression is limited to payments for the alimentation or support of the claimant; R(IS) 4/01 followed (paragraphs 9 and 10);
3.	accordingly, a decision should be substituted that the pension annuity payments did not constitute income of the claimant (actual or ""notional"") for income support purposes, and did not fall to be deducted in calculating the minimum income guarantee on his state retirement pension.",1,110,176,,

The claimant was in receipt of incapacity benefit. On 11 July 2001 his award of benefit was superseded on the grounds that he did not score sufficient points on the personal capability assessment. The claimant appealed to a tribunal. The tribunal made no award for the activity of rising from sitting, in respect of which the claimant had indicated on his self-assessment questionnaire that he sometimes could not rise from sitting without holding onto something (3 points). It found that the claimant's evidence that he had to push on the seat of the chair in order to rise was irrelevant to the activity of rising from sitting. The tribunal awarded a total of 13 points on the PCA and thus dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
a claimant who has to rely on some part of the chair other than the arms (i.e. the seat or the back) in order to deliver the force necessary to rise or to provide stability while rising is ""holding on to something"" within the terms of paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Social Security (Incapacity for Work)(General) Regulations 1995 and thus scores points, providing both that he ""cannot"" rise from sitting without using his arms to provide power or stability and that the disability arises from a specific bodily disease or disablement under regulation 25(3)(a) of the regulations.

The claimant claimed child benefit on 19 July 1993 in respect of his granddaughter, whose mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for her. The child had been taken into the care of the local authority but had been placed with her grandparents under a child plan agreed between the local authority, the grandparents and the childs mother as from 19 July 1993. No payment was made by the local authority to the grandparents for caring for the child. An adjudication officer refused the claim for child benefit on the ground that the child was in the care of a local authority and boarded out with the claimant and so entitlement was excluded under regulation 16(8) of the Child Benefit (General) Regulations 1976. The tribunal allowed the claimants appeal, holding that the child was not boarded out under regulation 16(8). The adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	child benefit was clearly payable from 30 August 1993 because regulation 11 of the Foster Placement (Children) Regulations 1991 (which revoked and replaced the Boarding Out of Children (Foster Placement) Regulations 1988, which in turn revoked and replaced the Boarding-Out of Children Regulations 1955 referred to in regulation 16(8) of the Child Benefit (General) Regulations) only permitted a child to be placed with a person who was not an approved foster parent for a maximum of six weeks. The grandparents were not approved foster parents and thus from 30 August 1993 the arrangement under which the child was living with the claimant was not within the 1991 regulations at all (paras. 19-20);
2.	the claimant was also entitled to child benefit in respect of the initial six week period from 19 July 1993. The Commissioner accepted that by virtue of regulation 1(4)(b) of the Child Benefit (General) Regulations, the reference in regulation 16(8) of those regulations to the Boarding-Out of Children Regulations 1955 could be construed as extending to the Foster Placement (Children) Regulations 1991 insofar as the latter directly or indirectly re-enacted or replaced the former (paras. 22-25). However, for regulation 16(8) to apply, it was not enough to find that a placement had been made under regulation 11 of the 1991 Regulations. It was necessary in each case to look at the individual circumstances to see if they constituted a boarding-out (paras. 26 to 35);
3. 	boarding-out was apt to describe an arrangement that had some commercial or professional aspect. It was wholly inapt to describe the arrangement in this case (paras. 36 to 37) which therefore did not fall within regulation 16(8).",1,1,,,

Held that:

However, the claim was not adjudicated upon until August 1990 when a claim was made for child benefit for the claimants second child born on 15 January 1980. The reason the claimant did not claim in respect of his second child until August 1990 was that he had been erroneously told in 1979 that he was not entitled to child benefit in respect of his first child. A tribunal confirmed the AOs decision that the claimant was not entitled to child benefit for his second child for any period earlier than six months prior to the date of claim (see regulation 19(6)(a) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 as then in force). The claimant appealed.

Held that:
1.	having regard to various provisions in the Child Benefit Act 1975, it was clear that a separate claim for child benefit had to be made for each eligible child. It was not open to a claimant simply to seek a review of an existing award to take account of the birth of another child;
2.	incorrect advice given by an officer of the Department could not give rise to an estoppel as the adjudicating authorities had no jurisdiction to award a benefit for which there is no statutory authority (R(F) 8/60 and R(F) 3/61 applied).",1,1,59,,

Held that:
in calculating the net profit of a business for the purpose of determining entitlement to family credit the normal accountancy procedure of taking both the opening and closing stock into account was to be applied.  The use of the phrase whether or not defrayed in that period in regulation 22(3A) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations was to be contrasted with the position under regulation 22(3) where a strictly cash basis was applied when accounts were not supplied.

The claimant married her husband in 1955 when both were domiciled in Pakistan. In 1962 the claimants husband came to England for employment, leaving the claimant and their three children in Pakistan. He registered as a British citizen in 1967. In 1969 he returned to Pakistan when his youngest child by the claimant was conceived and in January 1970, he went through a ceremony marriage with his second wife. A few days after the marriage, he returned with his second wife to England where they lived together until the husbands death in 1988. The claimant (the first wife) claimed widows benefit which was refused on the ground that she was not her husbands widow for social security purposes, because his marriage was not monogamous at the time of his death. On appeal to the Commissioner it was argued that by the time of the second marriage, the husband had acquired a domicile of choice in England and had not legal capacity to contract a marriage to the second wife while his marriage to the claimant subsisted.

Held that:
disagreeing with the approach in R(S) 2/92 and unreported decision CG/29/1990, it was not necessary in order to acquire a domicile of choice that a person should have decided to make his permanent home in the country concerned. An intention, formed independently of external pressures, to reside indefinitely in a territory subject to a distinctive legal system, with only vague or floating possibilities of returning to the territory of the domicile of origin would suffice to establish a domicile of choice (see in In the Estate of Fuld (No. 3) [1968] P674 and R(G) 1/93). The standard of proof required is not that of proof beyond reasonable doubt. There is no presumption that a person does not acquire a domicile of choice in a country whose religion, manners and customs differ widely from those of his own country. On the evidence, by January 1970 the husband had acquired a domicile of choice in England with the result that his second marriage was invalid and the claim succeeded (paras. 11 to 13).",1,219,,,

The claimant was absent from her employment due to illness. At first she was paid full salary (including statutory sick pay) which was later reduced to half salary.

Her claim for invalid care allowance was refused by the adjudication officer on the ground that she was gainfully employed within the meaning of regulation 8(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976.  On appeal, a social security appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. 

Held that:
under regulation 8(2)(b) of the 1976 regulations a persons earnings are disregarded for the purposes of  regulation 8(1) in any week in which he is absent from his employers  with the authority of his employer. Where an employee is absent due to illness the employer has to authorise the absence. Thus in such a case he is absent with the authority of his employer.

Tribunal practice - assessment of disablement where more than one cause - whether findings of fact adequate

The claimant was born without a right forearm and wore a cosmetic prosthesis. She injured her left wrist at work and claimed disablement benefit. The adjudicating medical authority found the disability resulting from the loss of faculty to be impaired dexterity, fully relevant (the F disability) and that the congenital disablement, though not of itself the other effective cause of that disability, increased through interaction, the disability arising from the loss of faculty (the C condition or connection factor) They made no offset and assessed disablement at 7% for the F disability and 70% for the C condition. The Secretary of State, on a reference of the case to the medical appeal tribunal, submitted that the congenital disablement constituted a pre-existing other effective cause of disablement for which an offset should have been made. The medical appeal tribunal assessed disablement at 10% after offsetting 70% for the congenital disablement and adding 5% for the interaction of the industrial injury and congenital disablement. The claimant appealed.

Held that:
(1)	all cases where there is a connection factor are cases where there is either an O(Pre) or O(Post) condition and must be assessed under regulation 11 of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (General Benefit) Regulations 1982. It is not possible to conceive of a case where there is a disability due to the interaction between a relevant loss of faculty and another condition where that other condition is not an other effective cause within regulation 11(2) of those regulations. There is no C condition independent of O(Pre) and O(Post) conditions (para.  9);
(2)	to explain adequately the assessment of disablement as required by regulation 31(4) of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986, an adjudicating medical authority must make findings as to the extent of the total current disablement arising from the relevant causes, the extent of the disablement from which the claimant would have suffered had the relevant accident not occurred (the offset) and the net assessment and, where a connection factor arises, that part of the assessment arising from it ought to be separately identified (paras. 10 and 11);

Her employment consisted of feeding heavy material with both hands under the needlefoot of an industrial sewing machine, which was accepted as a vibrating tool in this case. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim and the claimant appealed to the social security appeal tribunal. The tribunal allowed the appeal on the basis that the machine in question was a hands on machine which could not be operated without the operator applying pressure with the hands. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner, disputing that the machine fell within the meaning of hand-held in the prescription.

An adjudicating medical authority  had assessed the claimant's disablement at 10% for life (final) in 1969. In August 1981 she requested a review on the grounds of unforeseen aggravation. In October 1981 a Medical Board concluded that there had been no unforeseen aggravation. This decision was confirmed by a medical appeal tribunal in January 1982. In 1992 the claimant made a further application for review on the grounds of unforeseen aggravation, without obtaining leave from a medical appeal tribunal to make the application.

Held that:

In answer to the question from what date do you claim your disablement began ? he merely put a question mark but he told the adjudicating medial authority that he had started to get tingling in his right hand about 30 years ago.  The adjudicating medical authority nonetheless found that he had been suffering from the prescribed disease since 1 January 1992 which was a provisional date of onset determined administratively.  The adjudicating medical authority found that the claimant had been suffering form the prescribed disease from 1 January 1992 and assessed disablement at 3% from 15 April 1992 for life.  On appeal, the claimant told the medical appeal tribunal that he had started getting problems in the period from 1970 to 1973.  They assessed disablement at 5% from 15 April 1992 for life, finding that the claimants social and domestic activities such as playing bowls, darts, gardening and domestic duties have been affected.  The claimant appealed on the ground that the tribunal had failed to record proper findings of fact or adequate reasons for their decision so as to explain why their assessment was so low.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as far as disablement benefit was concerned, the determination of the date of onset of the relevant disease that resulted in the loss of faculty required answers to both the question whether the claimant had ever suffered from the disease and the question whether the relevant disease had resulted in a loss of faculty and consequently the determination of the date of onset arose as a diagnosis question and as a disablement question and was a matter for an adjudicating medical authority or medical appeal tribunal and not for an adjudication officer (para. 11);
2.	there was no evidence that the claimant had ever suggested that the date of onset was               1 January 1992 or that benefit had been claimed only from that date and the tribunal had erred in law in failing to determine the true date of onset (para. 15);
3.	the tribunal had also erred in law in failing to give adequate reasons for the assessment of disablement because, while the assessment of disablement was largely a matter of judgement, the basis upon which such a judgement is exercised should be made reasonably clear to the parties and a tribunal should record findings as to the practical effects of the claimants condition and indicate to what extent they had had regard to Schedule 2 of the Social Security (General Regulations) 1982 (para. 16).",1,188,,,

The claimant had worked as a miner from 1936 to 1960.  He claimed disablement benefit for pneumoconiosis on 12 May 1992, claiming benefit from 1960.  On 11 September 1992 a Special Medical Board decided that he was not suffering from the disease.  The medical appeal tribunal confirmed this decision, stating that films taken of the claimant showed evidence of early pneumoconiosis, Category 0/1.

Held that:
1.	the medical appeal tribunals decision was erroneous.  There is no degree of pneumoconiosis that has to be reached before a claimant can be found to have prescribed disease D1. A claimant either has the disease or he has not (para. 8);
2.	to determine the diagnosis question a tribunal has to exercise its clinical judgment.

The claimant was employed as a cleaner by a bus company between February 1970 and April 1993.  To clean the floor of the garage and inspection pit she used a rotating scrubbing/buffing machine.  It was a heavy machine which needed two people to carry it but it was operated by one person pushing it around the floor.  The machine vibrated considerably and had to be tightly gripped in order to manoeuvre it about.  An adjudication officer decided that prescribed disease A12 (carpal tunnel syndrome) was not prescribed in relation to the claimant because she had not been employed in an occupation involving the use of hand-held vibrating tools.  A social security appeal tribunal allowed the claimants appeal.  The adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
on the facts of this case the rotating scrubbing machine was a hand-held vibrating tool because it was mobile and required considerable and constant grip to operate it.  Thus the claimant had been employed in a prescribed occupation for prescribed disease A12.

The claimant claimed disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease A11 (vibration white finger) on 18 November 1991. On 22 November 1992 a medical appeal tribunal assessed disablement at 15% from 1 April 1985 (the date from which vibration white finger first became a prescribed disease). Disablement pension was awarded from 1 April 1985 as it was accepted that the claimant had shown good cause for his delay in claiming. The claimant was notified of this award on 30 or 31 January 1993. On 8 March 1993 he claimed reduced earnings allowance and asked for this to be paid from 5 February 1977. The adjudication officer decided that he was not entitled to reduced earnings allowance from 5 February 1977 to 7 December 1992 on the ground that the claim had not been made within the three month prescribed time limit and the claimant had not shown continuous good cause for the delay. The tribunal dismissed the claimants appeal. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the tribunals decision was erroneous in point of law because, in considering whether the claimant had good cause for the delay in claiming, they had asked themselves whether the claimant could have claimed earlier rather than asking whether it was reasonable for him not to have claimed earlier (para. 9);
2. on the facts, the claimant had good cause for his delay in claiming from the earliest date that benefit might be payable (paras. 12 and 13). Reduced earnings allowance was not payable before 1 October 1986 as it was only introduced from that date (to replace special hardship allowance). Special hardship allowance was not payable before 1 April 1985 as vibration white finger only became a prescribed disease from that date (para. 14);
3. the claim for reduced earnings allowance having been treated also as a claim for special hardship allowance, special hardship allowance might be payable from 1 April 1985 to 30 September 1986. Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to the Social Security Act 1986 were retrospective to the same extent as sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), despite the contrast in statutory language.

He was employed to clear forest areas, using a chain saw to fell the trees and cut them into logs. He contended that this occupation was prescribed in relation to occupational deafness because it involved ""the use of chain saws in forestry"" (sub-paragraph (i) of A10).

Held that:

the claimant's occupation did not fall within the meaning of ""forestry"" in paragraph A10 of Part I of Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985. His work involved the destruction of forest areas, not the preservation of them.

Held that:
1.	the social security appeal tribunal has failed to deal with the whole of the period before it. The award of income support from 6 August 1991 operated to put a terminal date on the period in issue in the appeal. The social security appeal tribunal should have examined the evidence (for instance in the claim made on 31 July 1991) on his hours of work throughout the period in issue from 24 June 1991 to 5 August 1991 (para. 7);
 2.	the social security appeal tribunal had erred in identifying the claimant with the company. The claimant was an employee of the company which was a separate legal person. It was necessary to identify the capacity in which the claimant did any work, as employee or as director, and to ask whether the claimant had a realistic expectation of receiving payment in the relevant capacity week by week. It is enough that there is an expectation of payment in the future for the current weeks work.

She worked for five days during June 1998 and her pay was similarly due to her at the end of the following month although she received it early, on 22 July 1998, because of the summer holidays. An adjudication officer decided she was not entitled to income support from 30 June 1998 because her earnings fell to be taken into account at a weekly amount which exceeded her applicable amount. She appealed to a social security appeal tribunal which upheld the adjudication officers decision. She appealed to a Commissioner, contending that under regulation 29(2)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 the period in respect of which each payment was made consisted of only the days actually worked in the preceding month, and not the whole month.

Held that:
the period referred to in regulation 29(2) must be a single period, and in the circumstances of the case the only such period is the period over which any monies earned would fall to be included in the relevant payment: in other words, a payment which is for the days worked in a particular month is payable in respect of that month.",1,106,,,

The claimant paid them by means of a further advance from his building society. He subsequently lost his employment and claimed IS. His housing costs were assessed on the basis of the original mortgage only. The social security appeal tribunal disallowed the claimants appeal from the decision of the adjudication officer to take account of the further advance of £23,000. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
the interest on the replacement loan could be met even though the replaced loans were interest free. It was significant that in paragraph 7(3)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations the word the had been omitted between that and interest. It had been submitted on behalf of the claimant that the word any was to be read between those words and this created no infelicity.

The claimant was a share fisherman operating a trawler with two other men. He made a claim for income support because the boat has not been able to put to sea due to bad weather. The adjudication officer considered the claimants pattern of work over the previous five weeks, in accordance with regulation 5(2)(b) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and disallowed the claim on the grounds that the claimant was in remunerative work. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal arguing that, when calculating his hours of work whilst at sea, rest periods should be ignored. The tribunal allowed the appeal, awarding benefit from the date of claim. The adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that
1.	in the case of an employed person, the test to establish if a person is engaged in work is that laid down by the House of Lords in Suffolk County Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Another [1984] ICR 882. This distinguishes between a person who is on duty and one who can do as he pleases (para. 13);
2.	this test can be applied by analogy to a self employed person. In this case the claimant could not do as he pleased during his rest periods because he could not leave the boat and might be called upon to help in an emergency. Therefore he should be treated as being engaged in work for the whole time the boat was at sea (para. 15).

On 26 March 1991 the adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to income support in respect of his two children because each of them possessed capital in excess of £3,000. On 4 November 1991 the social security appeal tribunal allowed the claimants appeal and determined that, since the shares held in the name of the children were not immediately realisable, they consequently commanded no market value. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
when valuing shares registered in the name of children for the purpose of income support, the practical difficulties involved in the realisation of such shares do not render them worthless or virtually worthless. It was irrelevant that the shares might be worthless as far as the claimant was concerned. The shares belonged to the claimants children not the claimant. The shares should be given their current market value less a discount to reflect the delay and inconvenience occasioned to a purchaser in obtaining good title for example, by means of a Court Order (paras. 5 and 6).

In 1992 the council wrote to the Department of Social Security asking for direct payments from his income support. The adjudication officer decided that this should be done. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, contending that he was not in rent arrears. The only evidence before the tribunal was the councils letter requesting direct payment. The tribunal rejected the appeal and the claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner

Held that:
1.	before any decision can be made under paragraph 5 of Schedule 9 to the Claim and Payments Regulations 1987, the adjudicating authorities are required to satisfy themselves that there are in fact rent arrears. In a routine case, a simple statement to that effect from the landlord would be sufficient, but where the claimant disputes the matter, a more detailed investigation is required (paras. 6 and 7);
2.	in deciding the amount of arrears, the adjudicating authorities should not offset the amount of any counterclaim. However, in exercising the discretion under paragraph 5(6) of Schedule 9 whether to make deductions for outstanding arrears, the existence of an arguable counterclaim is a factor that can legitimately be taken into account (para. 9).

At the end of the first academic year, she claimed income support for the summer vacation. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the grounds that her income exceeded her applicable amount. This was on the basis of including in her income both the dependants allowance and the single parents allowance because these were to be attributed to a 52 week period. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal contending that the single parents allowance should not be attributed to any day after the end of the first year of her course. The tribunal allowed the appeal and the adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
the single parents allowance was provided for in Schedule 4 to the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1992. Schedule 4 on its own awarded nothing but its effect was to increase in certain circumstances the amount awarded under Part III of Schedule 2 for the maintenance of dependants.

The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, contending that he had reported all the changes to his local office and had received and applied the reduced amounts of benefit to meet the interest due.

The claimant and her ex-husband were jointly and severally liable to a building society on the mortgage on her home. In calculating the housing costs element of the claimants income support the adjudication officer allowed only one half of the interest payable on the mortgage on the footing that the other half was being paid by one or both of the claimants daughters together with the claimants ex- husband.  The daughters were guarantors of the mortgage debt. 
On appeal, a social security appeal tribunal held that the claimant was entitled to have the entirety of the mortgage interest taken into account on the basis that, being jointly and severally liable, the claimant was legally liable for the entirety of the sums due to the building society. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

The claimant claimed income support on grounds of unemployment in January 1991. He was a member of an unmarried couple. His partner had set up a business in June 1990 as an agent for pop musicians, a type of work of which she had no previous experience. She received payments of enterprise allowance, which was a weekly allowance paid by the Manpower Services Commission for a period of 52 weeks to persons previously unemployed who had started a new business. One of the conditions of the scheme was that applicants must commit themselves to working full-time in the business. To get the business going, the claimants partner had first to recruit musicians who wished to be represented by her and then to obtain engagements for them, so there was considerable delay before she earned any commission on performances. By June 1991 she had earned no more than £200 from the business. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim but that decision was reversed by a social security appeal tribunal. The adjudication officer appealed to a Commissioner. The Commissioner held that:
(a)	the claimants partner was engaged in work for not less than 24 hours per week; 
(b) 	payment was being made for the work in the form of the enterprise allowance; 
(c) 	if it were necessary to decide the point, the work was being done in expectation of payment in the form of earnings from the business; and 
(d) 	accordingly the claimants partner was engaged in remunerative work as defined in regulation 5(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and so the claimant was excluded from entitlement to income support by section 20(3)(c) of the Social Security Act 1986. 

The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a payment of enterprise allowance was not a payment for work for the purpose of regulation 5(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The enterprise allowance scheme was not intended to provide recompense for the work done in the course of the business but rather was maintenance for the recipient during the period that the business was being launched. The Court declined to consider authorities concerning the effect of payments of enterprise allowance on entitlement to family credit as these depended on the interpretation of different regulations;
2.	the claimants partner was not, up to the date of the appeal tribunal hearing, doing work in expectation of payment. In considering this issue, it had to be born in mind that any business activity may involve spending time on work of a speculative nature e.g. attempting to obtain business or solicit custom, which if unsuccessful, will not attract any payment. A distinction had to be drawn between a business which was:
(a)	in the course of being set up, in which case work of a speculative nature should be regarded as merely preparatory for subsequent work for which there will be a realistic expectation of payment and so not taken into consideration for the purpose of regulation 5(1); and
(b)	established and up and running, in which case work of a speculative nature should be regarded as ancillary to work for which payment was being made and so taken into consideration for the purpose of regulation 5(1);
No precise test could be laid down whereby this distinction should be made. But in this case the tribunal had clearly decided that, as at the date of hearing, the business was still in the course of being set up. There was no reason to overturn that conclusion. 

The Court quashed the Commissioners decision and restored the decision of the tribunal that the claimant was entitled to income support.",1,237,,,

The claimants lived with their parents and were in receipt of income support and attendance allowance.  On the introduction of the income support scheme adjudicating officers decided that the claimants were not entitled a severe disability premium from 11 April 1988, because they did not satisfy the condition in paragraph 13(2)(a)(ii) in Schedule 2 of the Social Security Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, of having no non-dependants residing with them, as defined in regulation 3.  In May 1990 as a result of a decision of the Commissioner in CIS/180/1989 the above provisions were interpreted so that the claimants were able to qualify until regulation 3 was amended on the 9 October 1989.  As a result of that decision the claimants asked for severe disability premium to be paid.  In all the cases except CIS/788/1991 (James) this was done after 13 July 1990.  By that date the enactment of the Social Security Act 1990 resulted in the amendment of s. 104 of the Social Security Act 1975  (now s. 68 of the Social Security Act 1992) by the addition of subsections (7) and (8) which effectively limited any backdating on a review, based on a test case, by treating any decision affected by the test case as not having been erroneous in law.  In all the cases, except CIS/788/1991 (James), the adjudicating officer decided he was unable to revise his decision as a result of the 1990 Act , although this was expressed in different terms.  In CIS/788/1991 (James) the adjudication officer backdated an award of the premium subject to a twelve month limit, pursuant to regulation 69 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1986.  In all cases the tribunals accepted late appeals under regulation 3(3) of the Adjudication Regulations, against the original decisions, and decided the claimants were entitled to severe disability premium from 11 April 1988.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner arguing there could be no late appeal against the earlier decisions, because those decisions had been extinguished having been reviewed, and replaced. The Commissioner decided that a decision to refuse to revise or review does not alter a previous decision, and the statutory right to a late appeal against the earlier decision remains. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	the appellants cases depended on establishing there had been a review, the expression unable to revise and similar expressions, does not transform in substances what was a refusal to review into a review;
2.	there is no reason why, where there has been a review, an earlier decision should cease to exist, so as to prevent an appeal against it provided either the appeal is in time or leave to appeal out of time is granted (Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland in Thompson v.

The claimant obtained a loan of £36,000 to enable her to buy out sitting statutory tenants of a property of which she held the freehold, so as to provide a home for herself and her son.  A tribunal held that the loan was obtained to acquire an interest in the dwelling for the purposes of paragraph 7(3) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, so that interest on that loan and any replacement loan was eligible interest, on the sole ground that paragraph 7(3) did not exclude the case of a person who already had one interest and was acquiring another.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner, contending that the tribunal had wrongly ignored the argument that the claimant had not acquired an interest because the sitting tenants had had merely a statutory right of occupation.

Held, setting aside the tribunals decision but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	the phrase acquiring an interest in the dwelling had to be construed in the context of the legislative purpose of Schedule 3 which was to provide help with the costs of housing in order to avoid homelessness (para. 16);
2.	an interest was not restricted to an interest in land within the meaning of the Law of Property Act 1925 but extended in this context to closely analogous rights of tenure or occupancy similar to that of a true tenant (paras. 22 and 23);
3.	acquiring was not to be construed so as to exclude the case where an interest was bought only for the purpose of extinguishing it (para. 24);
4.	therefore, acquiring an interest in a dwelling included the case where a property owner who did not have any present right of occupation or possession paid money for the purpose of buying out such rights but it would not include the case of buying out squatters where the owner would merely be paying to give effect to his own existing rights (paras. 25 and 26);

Three appeals, concerning the valuation provisions and the validity of regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, were heard by a tribunal of Commissioners. In all three cases, social security appeal tribunals had decided that income support was not payable because the claimants capital exceeded the prescribed amount (£8,000) on account of the tribunals valuation of the claimants interest in property.

The claimants interest in the house was her only asset. 

CIS/417/1992 (Dowell) concerned a claimant who, with her daughter and son-in-law had purchased a freehold property as a family home. At the time of the decisions of the adjudication officer and the appeal tribunal it was thought that she had a 1/4 share, although it subsequently transpired that she had a 1/3 share. They all lived in the property. Later, the claimant went into a residential home and claimed income support. 

CIS/85/1992 (McDonnell) concerned a claimant who was separated from her husband and was taking proceedings for divorce. She was in receipt of rents from a tenanted property, the beneficial ownership of which was in dispute. Her solicitors anticipated that her husband (who had made the only cash contribution other than that provided on the mortgage) would claim the entire beneficial interest in the property. The claimant contested his claim. An estate agent advised that while divorce proceedings were going on, and ownership was in dispute, the property was not marketable. The claimant claimed income support. 

Held, by the tribunal of Commissioners, that:

CIS/391/1992
1.	regulation 52 treats a claimant, who is one of two beneficial joint tenants, as possessed of an equal one half share of the relevant capital asset and it is that share of the beneficial interest that is to be valued when calculating the claimants capital for income support purposes (paras. 38 to 43);
2.	it is the market value of the deemed share that is to be ascertained (para. 38);
3.	the Commissioners have jurisdiction to determine whether a regulation is ultra vires on the ground of irrationality if this is necessary for the determination of the issue which arises before them. Such an issue is only likely to arise on rare occasions but when it does the Commissioner has a positive duty to rule on ultra vires (para. 45);
4.	regulation 52 is not irrational and is valid (para. 46);

CIS/417/1992
5.	where a claimant is entitled to an actual equal beneficial share of a capital asset, it makes no difference whether or not regulation 52 applies: for a deemed equal share falls to be valued as if it were actual capital and at current market value (paras. 23 to 24);
CIS/85/1992
6.	a freehold interest in property subject to a lease or tenancy is a reversionary interest within the meaning of paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and accordingly is exempt from valuation as capital (paras. 26 to 33 and 36) (R(SB) 3/86 not followed);
7.	the capital value of any right to receive rent must be disregarded by virtue of paragraph 24 of Schedule 10, and the rents themselves must be treated as the claimants capital, and not income, when received by virtue of regulation 48(4) and paragraph 22(1) of Schedule 9 (para. 36).

The Chief Adjudication Officer and the Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal against the decisions of the tribunal of Commissioners and in two other appeals raising similar issues, contending that the correct construction of regulation 52 required that the whole beneficial interest in the asset must be valued and then divided into the same number of equal shares as there are persons entitled to the beneficial interest in possession, the claimant being debited with his share of that value. They also argued that a freehold interest in property subject to a lease or tenancy is not a reversionary interest within the meaning of paragraph 5 of Schedule 10.

Held, by the Court of Appeal, unanimously dismissing the appeals, that: 
1.	in the case of a freehold or leasehold property the persons beneficially entitled in possession are to be treated as if each of them are tenants in common holding equal shares and regulation 52 requires the claimants deemed (or actual) beneficial interest in an equal share to be taken into account (per Nourse and Hobhouse LJJ);
2.	regulation 52 provides that the preceding provisions of Chapter VI, in these cases regulation 49(a), shall apply for the purposes of calculating the amount of capital which the claimant is treated as possessing. That means his interest must be valued at the current market value (per Nourse LJ);
3.	there is no limitation on the words any capital asset: they include, but are not limited to, real property such as a dwelling house. The words apply to money, to shares in a company, and to an enforceable claim (per Sir Ralph Gibson);
4.	regulation 52 does not expressly provide that the division into equal shares shall follow upon the presumption of equality and after valuation of the capital asset and in the context of this legislation it is safer to proceed upon the basis that clear language would be used to express that intention. To the extent that the wording of the provision is consistent with an applicant being treated as possessing a capital asset having the real value of that asset at the material time rather than a larger value, which in his hands it does not have, to that extent the provision should be construed as requiring or permitting the applicant to be treated in accordance with the true facts (per Sir Ralph Gibson);
5.	a freehold interest in property subject to a lease or tenancy is a reversionary interest for the purposes of paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.

The claimant was training to be an architect. He had completed his BA degree course and had to find a years placement with a firm before undertaking a further two years study (to be followed by a further years practical experience) in order to complete his professional training. As he had difficulty obtaining a placement, he registered as unemployed on 8 July 1992 but did not make a claim for income support until 14 August 1992. Income support was awarded from that date but for the period up to 23 September 1992 £45.94 a week was taken into account as income, being 1/53 of the dependants and mature students additions included in the claimants grant for the academic year 1991/2. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, who decided that the claimant was not entitled to income support at all because he was to be treated as a student attending a full-time course of study and as such was precluded from receiving income support. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	a course was a unified sequence of study, tuition and/or practical training....... intended to lead to one or more qualifications obtained on its completion. Thus if a profession required more than one qualification for which colleges did not provide a single sequence of tuition and/or experience, the person was not engaged on one course throughout, but completed one course before moving on to another. The claimant therefore did not fall within paragraph (a) of the definition of student in regulation 61 of the Income Support Regulations (paras. 17 to 21). Paragraph (b) of that definition also did not apply as the claimant was not on a sandwich course, since any periods of outside practical experience were not associated with his full-time study within the meaning of the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1987 (para. 22). The Commissioner therefore set aside the tribunals decision as erroneous in law and substituted his own decision that the claimants course had finished at the end of the summer term 1992;
2.	since the claimant had ceased to be a student by the date of his claim for income support, regulation 62 of the Income Support Regulations relating to the calculation of grant income did not apply. The dependants and mature student elements of the grant he had previously received no longer had to be apportioned to current weeks (CIS/7/1988 applied). Therefore no deduction was to be made for these elements of his grant in calculating the claimants income support for the period 14 August to 23 September 1992 (paras. 29 to 30);
3.	the claimant had not shown good cause for his delay in claiming income support as he had deliberately refrained from so doing and so he was not entitled to income support for the period before 14 August 1992.",1,263,52,,

The adjudication officer's decision under appeal stated that ""As a result of the review decision dated  3 November 1992 an overpayment of income support has been made..."". The claimant contended that it had not been shown that the review necessary as a precondition to the recovery of an overpayment had been carried out. Before the tribunal the presenting officer stated that the original review has been carried out on a computer and a letter of review forwarded to the claimant. However no copy of that letter was produced. The social security appeal tribunal (by a majority) decided that there had been a review. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. a computer print out was not sufficient by itself to establish that the review required by section 71(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1991 has been carried out. Verbal evidence to interpret the print out, or a copy of the letter informing the claimant of the decision, if it contained the relevant material, might suffice (paras. 10, 11 and 12);
2. while it might have been open to the tribunal to consider the question of review as a matter first arising in the course of the appeal under section 36 of the Administration Act 1992, it was not appropriate for this to be conducted at Commissioner level. In the circumstances the Commissioner declined to remit the matter back to the tribunal and allowed the claimant's appeal (paras. 14 and 15).",1,274,234,,

The claimant had lived on a farm of which she was the joint owner with her husband. On 2 July 1992 she went to live in a residential care home on a permanent basis. Her husband continued to live in the farmhouse. Income support was awarded from 2 July 1992. It was later established that the value of the farmland was about £35,000. The land was farmed by a partnership of the claimants husband and son; it was accepted that the land, which had its own access, could be sold separately from the farmhouse. The adjudication officer reviewed the decision awarding income support, deciding that although the value of the farmhouse could be disregarded under paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations, the value of the farmland could not. The claimant was therefore not entitled to income support because her capital exceeded the prescribed limit of £8,000. The tribunal allowed the claimants appeal holding that the value of the claimants interest in the farm was nil as she would be unlikely to find a willing purchaser without her husbands agreement to a sale. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held that:
1. premises in paragraph 4 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations was to be interpreted in line with the definition of dwelling occupied as the home in regulation 2(1). The first four paragraphs of Schedule 10 were all concerned with disregarding the claimants home or what would be the home if the claimant was in actual occupation, and thus it was entirely consistent for premises in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to be given a similar interpretation. The tribunal had therefore not erred in law by failing to apply paragraph 4 of Schedule 10 to the whole of the farm (paras. 17 and 18);
2. however the tribunal had erred in law by not considering regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations. The effect of regulation 52 was to deem the claimant to have an equal undivided share as beneficial tenant in common of the farm (see Chief Adjudication Officer v. Palfrey and para. 49 of CIS/391/1992[R(IS) 26/95]) (paras. 19 and 20);
3. although there were grounds for review of the decision to award income support because it was given in ignorance of the facts relating to the claimants beneficial interest in the farm, the adjudication officer had not shown that the decision to award the claimant income support should be revised (para. 29). The District Valuers valuation of the claimants interest seemed to have been based on the revenue approach which was inconsistent with the approach required by paragraphs 53 and 54 of CIS/391/1992 [R(IS) 26/95]. Moreover it was based on an assumption that an order for sale of the farm was likely to be granted but this seemed doubtful in the circumstances. Accordingly the adjudication officer had not shown that the claimants notional share of the farm had a market value which was sufficient to affect her entitlement to income support;
4. the claimant was therefore entitled to income support until her death on 2 February 1994.",1,19,24,,

The court order made on the claimants divorce provided for him to transfer his entire interest in the former matrimonial home to his ex-wife in return for a charge on the property equal to 16/57ths of its value. The charge was not to be enforced until his former wife died, remarried or cohabited for a period of six months or more. His former wife was aged 46 and in good health. The adjudication officer refused his claim for income support on the ground that his capital exceeded the prescribed limit of £8,000. The social security appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal, holding that he was entitled to a share of the property which they valued at £10,385 by taking 16/57ths of its full current value less sale expenses. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner

Held that:
1.	the claimants rights under the court order did not confer on him any interest in the property but gave him a right to a money sum only. He had a secured debt payable at a future date, which was not a reversionary interest (Re Fisher [1943] Ch 377 at 328-3 followed). Thus his rights did not fall to be disregarded altogether under paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (paras. 12 to 14);
2.	however the tribunal had erred in their valuation of the claimants rights under the court order as they had not applied any discount for the fact that the debt was not payable immediately and possibly not for many years, so that its current value could not be anything like 16/57ths of the property itself (paras. 15 and 16).",1,28,29,,

The claimant took out a bank loan to order to install central heating in his home. The interest on that loan was included in his income support award in accordance with paragraph 8(1)(a) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The claimant then sold that home and moved to a new one. The adjudication officer decided that he was no longer entitled to interest on the loan. The social security appeal tribunal allowed his appeal on the grounds that there was nothing to state that the benefit of paragraph 8 should cease if the client moved from the home in respect of which the loan had been taken out. The adjudication officer appealed to the social security Commissioner.

Held that:

The claimant was a British national who had been born in Burma and lived there all her life until she separated from her husband and came to the United Kingdom in June 1992. Her husband and children remained in Burma. She obtained employment in July 1992 but was made redundant in May 1994. She then claimed and was paid income support. In July 1994 she returned to Burma as her husband was thought to be terminally ill. She came back to the United Kingdom on 20 August 1994 and claimed income support on 31 August 1994. Her claim was refused on the ground that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom. A tribunal rejected her appeal and she appealed to a Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	it was for the adjudicating authorities to be satisfied that a claimant was not habitually resident before the special provisions for persons from abroad were applied. However, a tribunal should try to decide the issue by enquiring further into the facts, rather than treating it as a matter of where the burden of proof lay (para. 15);
2.	a person who has not established residence in the United Kingdom cannot become habitually resident. To be resident a person must be making a home here (para. 19);
3. whether a person is habitually resident is a factual and objective question, to be decided by reference to all the circumstances (Re J (a minor) [1990] 2 AC 562 at 578G applied) (paras. 18 and 20);
4. in order for a person to become habitually resident, an appreciable period of time of actual residence and not merely a settled intention to reside was necessary (para. 21). What counted as an appreciable period of time depended on the facts of each case. It should be a period which showed a settled and viable pattern of living here as a resident (para. 28). The practicality of a persons arrangements for their residence was a necessary part of determining whether it could be described as settled and habitual. In deciding whether a persons plans for living here were viable, the possibility of claiming income support had to be left out of account (para. 29);
5. habitual residence was not necessarily lost during periods of temporary or occasional absence (R v. Barnet LBC ex p. Shah [1983] 2 AC 309 at 342 and Case 76/76 Di Paolo [1977] ECR 315, para. 21 considered) (paras. 26 and 32);
6. on the facts of this case the claimant has clearly become habitually resident in the UK before she left on 20 July 1994 and she did not cease to be habitually resident here while temporarily absent in Burma.

The claimant worked in a school as a member of the non-teaching staff. Her hours of work were 20 per week during term-time (38 weeks of the year). In addition she was paid for six weeks holiday each year. For the remaining eight weeks of the year she neither worked nor was in receipt of paid holiday. Her claim for income support was refused on the grounds that she was in remunerative work within the meaning of regulation 5, Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The adjudication officer considered that the total hours worked each year amounted to 880 (20 x 44 weeks), which when divided by 52 came to an average of 16.92 hours per week. On appeal the tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. The claimant appealed to the social security Commissioner

Held that:
1.	the claimants hours of work fluctuated during the academic year but there was a recognisable cycle over the year. She therefore fell within regulation 5(2)(b)(i). The cycle was one year (para. 6);
2. 	in deciding the number of hours worked per week during the cycle, the relevant figure to be divided by 52 was 760 (20 x 38 weeks), not 880 The claimant was only required to actually work for 38 weeks. Regulation 5(1) defines remunerative work as work in which a person is engaged (not for which a person is engaged). The implication was that the claimant actually had to be working. This view was supported by the meaning of regulation 5(3) as explained in paragraph 14 of CIS/748/1992 [now reported as R(IS) 15/94] (para. 10);

The claimant was admitted to hospital as an in-patient on 19 April 1993 but had various periods of home leave and could go out during the day. By virtue of regulation 21 of, and paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to, the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 the claimant would become entitled to a reduced rate of income support after being a patient for six weeks. Regulation 21(3) of those regulations defines a patient as a person who is receiving free in-patient treatment within the meaning of the Social Security (Hospital In-Patients) Regulations 1975.  The Department of Social Security did not become aware of the claimants admission to hospital until September 1993. An adjudication officer then decided that there had been an overpayment of income support which was recoverable from the claimant by reason of his failure to disclose or misrepresentation of a material fact. The claimant appealed against this decision on the ground that he should not be classed as a patient because he had very few meals in the hospital and was away for most evenings and weekends. The tribunal disallowed his appeal.

Held that:
1. in determining whether a person was an in-patient for the purposes of regulation 2(2) of the Social Security Hospital In-Patients Regulations 1975, the circumstances existing at the beginning of a day were to be treated as continuing throughout that day (see CU/54/1948, CS/131/1949 (reported), R(S) 9/52). Thus a day on which a person is admitted, or returns, to hospital is not a day on which a person is discharged from, or leaves, hospital is to be treated as such a day;
2. the rule laid down in R(S) 1/66 in relation to disqualification from benefit that a person is only disqualified for days throughout which he is absent from Great Britain does not apply in this context. The provision at issue in that case used the phrase for any period during which, which the Commissioner decided meant throughout. However, regulation 2(2) merely refers to any period for which the person receives free in-patient treatment. Therefore, R(S) 1/66 does not indicate that decisions mentioned above are wrongly decided.

The claimant was resident in a nursing home run by a Trust, registered under Part II of the Registered Homes Act 1984 as a nursing home for the care of mentally handicapped persons. The home had formerly been a unit of a hospital run by the Area Health Authority and had been transferred to the Trust. The nursing and domestic staff transferred with the unit. 24 hour nursing cover was maintained at the home with a minimum of three nursing staff on duty during the day and two at night. The claimant was registered with a GP. The costs of maintaining the claimant were borne by the Trust. Any necessary drugs, treatment or nursing care were administered by the nursing staff. The claimant was one of twelve residents said to be severely mentally handicapped so as to need a high degree of care and supervision in their daily lives, but none of them was mentally ill in the sense that he or she needed or received treatment for mental illness. The residents were not free to come and go as they pleased. The claimant claimed income support on 29 July 1991 on the transfer to the Trust. The adjudication officer decided that she could only be entitled to income support at the modified rate appropriate to an in-patient and that she was not entitled to benefit. Her appeal to the tribunal was allowed on the ground that the home was not a hospital nor a similar institution nor was the claimant an in-patient; she did not fall within regulation 2(2) of the Hospital In-Patient Regulations 1975 because she was not undergoing medical or other treatment and was not being maintained free of charge. The adjudication officer appealed. Before the Commissioner, it was argued on behalf of the adjudication officer that the case was on all fours with White v. CAO (CA 21 July 1993) [R(IS) 18/94] and that, in the light of that decision, the claimant must be held to be an in-patient. It was argued for the claimant that her case was distinguishable on its facts because inter alia she was not mentally ill but only suffered a degree of mental handicap and did not require nursing as had almost all the residents of the home considered by the Court of Appeal in White. The Commissioner rejected that argument on the ground that it was only necessary to consider if nursing care was available if required. The Commissioner allowed the appeal confirming the disallowance of benefit as the claimants income from severe disablement allowance equalled the modified applicable amount. The claimant then appealed. It was argued before the Court of Appeal, that she and her fellow residents received care rather than treatment which they did not need and in those circumstances it could not be said that they received medical or other treatment or that they were patients or that the home was a similar institution to a hospital. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	hospital in regulation 2(2) should be construed as defined in section 128 of the National Health Service Act 1977. Section 128 defined hospital as (a) any institution for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness and illness also defined, included mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983 and any injury or disability requiring medical or dental treatment or nursing. There was no definition of nursing but section 1 of the Mental Health Act 1983 defined mental disorder as meaning mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other disorder or disability of mind;
2.	malfunction or non-functioning of the mind not caused by illness but due to some defect in the mental processes which might not be identified let alone be treated in the current state of medical knowledge, was within the definition of mental disorder. The argument that the degree of handicap described as learning difficulties was not within the definition was rejected;
3.	persons suffering from the degree of mental handicap to which the claimant was subject were within the definition of mental disorder; the care and assistance which they received from nursing as opposed to domestic staff must be regarded as medical or other treatment within the statutory definition; and the home in which they resided so that this could be made available to them was a similar institution to a hospital.

The claimants income support was reduced by virtue of income attributed to children under regulation 44(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 because they attended a boarding school in Norfolk and the fees were paid by the local education authority in Essex. That decision was upheld by a social security appeal tribunal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the children were not resident at the school as they attended in only certain weeks of the year. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal because it was logical that there should be a reduction of income support while the children were living elsewhere and there was no reason to distinguish between part year attendance and attendance for all 52 weeks of a year. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there is no authority for the proposition that a child cannot be resident at a school where he boards for only 35 weeks of the year;
2.	securing the provision of boarding school accommodation in another County by direct payment of fees satisfies the requirement for maintenance in regulation 44(3)(a) so that the child must be treated as possessing the income prescribed.",1,172,245,,

Bate,,"Anti-test case rule - whether the only decisions whose reversal brings the rule into operation are those made consistently with a binding authority - whether the rule has effect on subsequent decisions of Commissioners or the courts

Severe disability premium - meaning of the term resides with in the definition of non dependant - meaning of the term jointly occupies in the exception from the definition

Miss Bate was a single woman with learning difficulties who lived with her parents in a house owned by them. She was in receipt of supplementary benefit until 1988 when this was converted to income support. In calculating her entitlement the adjudication officer decided that she did not satisfy the qualifying conditions for severe disability premium set out in paragraph 13(2)(a)(ii) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 because her parents were non-dependants who resided with her.
In May 1990 a Commissioner made decisions in two cases (Trotman/Crompton) involving claimants who lived with their parents without being joint owners with them. He held that the parents were persons who jointly occupied the claimants dwelling and so fell within the exception from the definition of non-dependant in regulation 3(2)(c) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The term jointly occupies merely meant that the occupiers enjoyed equality of access and use of the premises.
Miss Bate considered that this rule applied to her case and so in August 1990 applied for a review of her entitlement. The adjudication officer refused to review on the grounds that the anti-test case rule set out in sections 104(7) and (8) of the Social Security Act 1975 applied. The Trotman/Crompton decision was a relevant determination and so Miss Bates entitlement for any period prior to May 1990 had to be determined as if the Commissioner had found the decision of the adjudicating authority under appeal in Trotman/Crompton not to be erroneous in law. Miss Bate appealed to a social security appeal tribunal who in November 1990 allowed her appeal.
The adjudication officer appealed to a Commissioner. The arguments before the Commissioner were concerned solely with the interpretation of the anti-test case rule. The claimant contended that the only decisions of an adjudicating authority whose reversal would bring the rule into operation were those made consistently with a binding authority. In a decision of 13 January 1993, Mr. Commissioner Sanders rejected this interpretation and allowed the appeal, substituting his own decision that Miss Bate was not entitled to the severe disability premium. 
Miss Bate appealed to the Court of Appeal. In argument before the Court, both parties advanced fresh contentions regarding both the effect of the anti-test case rule and the qualifying conditions for severe disability premium. In its decision of 30 November 1994, the Court (Glidewell, Mann and Millett LJJ) held that: (1) the anti-test case rule had no effect on subsequent decisions made by Commissioners or the Courts because the rule only covered how a question arising on the review should be dealt with. In a case such as the present a Commissioner or the Court was not conducting a review but rather dealing with an appeal from a refusal to review; (2) the phrase jointly occupies in regulation 3(2)(c) of the General Regulations connoted that the occupation of the premises by each of the persons concerned was based on the same legal right; (3) Miss Bates parents were not her non-dependants as defined in regulation 3(1) of the General Regulations because they did not reside with her. A person who was not a householder could be said to reside with the householder but the reverse was not the case. The Court therefore allowed the appealed. The adjudication officer appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the anti-test case rule, set out in sections 104(7) and (8) of the Social Security Act 1975, had effect on subsequent determinations made by Commissioners or the Courts. The contrary was not implied by the use of the term question arising on the review in section 104(8). If the adjudication process is commenced by an application for review, the subsequent stages of reconsideration at each level are part of the same process and this remains one of review, irrespective of whether the application for review is accepted or rejected (page 8);
2.	there was nothing in the wording of the legislation to limit the application of the anti test case rule to cases where the decision of the adjudicating authority referred to in section 104(7) of the Social Security Act 1975 was one made consistently with a binding authority (page 8);
3.	the term resides with in regulation 3(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 meant no more than that the claimant and the other person live in the same residence or dwelling. The phrase applied both where the household is that of the claimant and where it is that of the other person. Who has the ownership or tenancy of the property was irrelevant for the purpose of deciding whether a person resides with the claimant (page 11);
4.	the term jointly occupies in regulation 3(2)(c) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 did not apply where there was merely co-residence of the claimant and the other person. It is a technical expression which connotes that the persons concerned have a common legal relationship either with a third party or an item of property. The decision of the Court of Appeal to the same effect in Fulwood v. Chesterfield BC [1993] 92 LGR 160, interpreting a similarly worded provision in the housing benefit regulations, approved (page 12).

The claimants had been living in residential accommodation provided by county councils under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948.  The county councils leased the properties to voluntary organisations who carried on the homes as residential care homes.  Adjudication officers decided that the accommodation was provided under arrangements made under Part III and that the claimants were therefore persons in residential accommodation as defined in regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.  The claimants appealed, contending that they were living in residential care homes within regulation 19.  Appeals to tribunals were dismissed in one case and allowed in the other.  On further appeals, the Commissioner decided that the claimants were living in residential care homes.  The Chief Adjudication Officer and the Secretary of State for Social Security appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed their appeals.  They appealed to the House of Lords, arguing that it was plain that the county councils had made arrangements for the care and accommodation of the claimants of the kind mentioned in section 21(1)(a) of the 1948 Act.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	by virtue of section 21(5) of the 1948 Act, accommodation provided under Part III meant accommodation provided in accordance with this and the next five sections and it was therefore necessary for arrangements made through another party to include provision under section 26(2) for the local authority to make payments to the other party and under section 26(3) for the person accommodated to refund those payments;
2.	there was no such provision in these cases and therefore the arrangements were not made under Part III of the 1948 Act and the claimants were not persons in residential accommodation;
3.	it was unnecessary to consider whether other statutory provisions gave the county councils the power to do what they had done.

From about 1983 the claimant was an in-patient in a psychiatric hospital. In 1986 her daughter was appointed as her receiver by the Court of Protection, but she died in April 1988. In May 1988 the local authority moved the claimant into a nursing home. On 27 May 1988 an income support claim form was completed for the claimant by a care assistant in the nursing home and the claimant signed it beside the standard declaration that the information on the form was correct and complete. The form was completed to indicate that she had no savings. Income support was awarded. In February 1989 the claimants son was appointed receiver by the Court of Protection. On 5 July 1989 the sons solicitors wrote to the nursing home to explain that the claimant had savings of £36,000 and asked them to notify the Department of Social Security. An adjudication officer reviewed and revised the award and found her entitlement was nil, that she had been overpaid £8,842.95 income support and that sum was recoverable. The son appealed arguing that his mother had been incapable of making a misrepresentation, that he had been unaware of the manner in which the nursing home fees were paid until shortly before the solicitors letter of 5 July 1989 and that the nursing home had no power to make a claim on his mothers behalf. The social security appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision. The son appealed to the Commissioner who decided that the son had no liability because he had disclosed to the Department of Social Security the material fact of the claimants capital as soon as he became aware that it was necessary to do so. He decided that the claimant was mentally incapable of making a misrepresentation and in fact made no misrepresentation because she lacked the power of reasoning necessary for her to be negligent in the legal sense. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, unanimously allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the son was not liable, for the reasons given by the Commissioner;
2.	the effect of the words whether fraudulently or otherwise in subsection (1) was that section 53 of the Social Security Act 1986 applied to innocent as well as to fraudulent misrepresentations and failures to disclose, Page and Davis v. Chief Adjudication Officer (CA, 24 June 1991) [R(SB) 2/92] applied;
3.	when a person has misrepresented a material fact her knowledge of that fact, or that she is making a misrepresentation, is irrelevant so far as section 53 is concerned (dictum of Evans LJ in Jones v. Chief Adjudication Officer [1994] 1 WLR 62, 64C [R(IS) 7/94] approved); 
4.	although the claim form was filled in by the nursing home, it was signed by the claimant and was her claim;
5.	the making of representations on the claim form was a necessary condition of entitlement to benefit and a necessary part of making the claim: the claimant had not been shown to lack the necessary mental capacity to make a claim and by signing the claim form made any representations which it contained her representations, so that the overpaid benefits were recoverable from her under section 53(2);
6.	alternatively if the claimant had lacked the necessary mental capacity to make the claim containing the misrepresentation, the Secretary of State was entitled to recover the overpaid benefits under the general law of restitution as payments made in the mistaken belief that a claim had in fact been made by her;

Capital - award by Criminal Injuries Compensation Board calculated by reference to financial loss -  whether a payment made in consequence of any personal injury

On 29 April 1994 the claimant, who was then in receipt of income support, was paid £24,500 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. He immediately paid that sum to his building society in reduction of his mortgage and advised the local office of his action. The adjudication officer reviewed the award and disallowed benefit from 26 April 1994 on the ground that the claimant possessed notional capital exceeding £8,000. On 24 June 1994 the building society repaid the £24,500 to him and on 2 July 1994 the claimant paid the sum into an instant access account. On 19 July 1994 the claimant appealed and on 17 October 1994 the tribunal allowed the appeal. The tribunal found that the claimant had not disposed of his money for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support and that when he paid it into the instant access account it was for the purpose of creating a trust so that it fell to be disregarded under paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The adjudication officer appealed. On 5 December 1994 the claimant transferred the sum into a three year bond. On behalf of the adjudication officer it was argued before the Commissioner that (a) the tribunal had given inadequate reasons for rejecting the argument that the claimant, by paying the sum to his building society, had deprived himself of capital for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support; and (b) no trust had been created by the payment to the building society on 2 July 1994 so that the monies held in the instant access account should have been treated as an actual resource of the claimant.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal were entitled to find that the payment on 29 April 1994 had not been for the purpose of securing income support;
2.	the repayment by the building society had not been subject to any obligation to create a trust. The tribunal had erred in law in finding that the claimant created a trust by his payment on 2 July 1994. For practical purposes the investing member of a building society is in the same financial position as the customer of a bank. He is a creditor for the amount of the money in the account and his debt is a chose in action and an actual resource. Although the value of a debt may be less than the amount owed, where money is held by a bank or building society in an account from which it may be withdrawn at any time, the value of the debt will be the amount owed because the money will be paid on immediate demand. If the money is available on demand but subject to an interest penalty, the amount available will reflect that penalty. Thomas v. CAO (reported as R(SB)17/87) considered;
3.	the terms of the bond purchased on 5 December 1994 included one preventing withdrawal during its term. The market value of that chose in action would be less than the amount invested but would in the circumstances be in excess of the capital limit. Further the difference in value would fall to be considered under the notional capital rule;
4.	the award by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was a payment made in consequence of any personal injury within paragraph 12 although its amount had been calculated by reference to the claimants loss of earnings and lowering of living standards;
5.	the claimants award of income support fell to be revised only with effect from 24 June 1994 from which date the claimant was not entitled to income support.",1,21,28,,

Benefit was paid every week, and on each occasion the claimant signed a declaration I declare that I have read and understood all the instructions in the order book, that I have correctly reported any facts which could affect the amount of any payment and I am entitled to the above sum. On making routine enquiries sometime later, the Department discovered that the interest rate on one mortgage had reduced, causing an overpayment of benefit. The adjudication officer, and on appeal a tribunal, decided the overpayment was recoverable under section 71(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, because in signing the declaration the claimant had represented, albeit not fraudulently, that she had correctly reported any facts that could affect the amount of her benefit, whereas, unknown to her, the interest rate had reduced. Although the tribunal accepted the claimant had not known the interest rate had fallen, they considered that lack of knowledge was immaterial to the form of declaration made. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner who dismissed the appeal on the ground that there was no scope for implying into the declaration a qualification that the representation was true as far as the claimant was aware.

the fact of a previous award does not raise any presumption in the claimants favour or result in the need for consistency having to be treated as a separate issue on a renewal claim (para. 14) .

The claimant became incapable of work when aged 58 and as her contribution record was deficient, she claimed income support. On reaching age 60 she was paid retirement pension. When aged 67 she sought to de-retire so that she could re-qualify for invalidity benefit which although paid at the same rate as her retirement pension, would in turn enable her to qualify for the higher pensioner premium of income support. The adjudication officer decided that she was not entitled to de-retire because being over the age 65, she did satisfy the provisions of section 54 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and regulation 2(1) of the Social Security Widows Benefit and Retirement Pensions) Regulations 1979. A man could de-retire up to age 70 under those provisions. The claimant argued that those provisions were discriminatory on the grounds of sex and contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC.

Held that:
the provisions of paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 dealing with entitlement to higher pensioner premium were identical to those in paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 which were considered by the European Court of Justice in R v. Secretary of State ex parte Smithson, ECJ Case 243/90 and the reasoning of the court in that case applied equally to this. Article 3 of the Directive did not apply to the income support scheme even if criteria concerning protection against some of the risks listed by the directive such as sickness or invalidity were applied in order to determine the claimants notional income. The higher pensioner premium was an inseparable part of the whole benefit intended to compensate for the fact that the beneficiarys income was insufficient to meet living costs and could not be characterised as an autonomous scheme intended to provided protection against one of the risks listed on Article 3(1) (paras. 15 to 18).",1,117,262,,

Until 6 April 1987, section 119 of the Social Security Act 1975 provided that overpayments of benefits payable under that Act were recoverable from a claimant unless the claimant had used due care and diligence to avoid overpayment.  From that date, section 53 of the Social Security Act 1986 provided that any overpayment due to a misrepresentation as to, or a failure to disclose, a material fact was recoverable from the person who had made the misrepresentation or had failed to disclose the material fact.  The claimant was overpaid retirement pension from 22 January 1981 to 7 October 1987 because he did not report the fact that his wife had earnings.  An adjudication officer held that the overpayment was recoverable from him under section 53 of the 1986 Act.  A tribunal allowed his appeal in part, holding that disclosure could not reasonably have been expected from 22 January 1981 to 6 January 1982 but that there had been a failure to disclose the earnings thereafter and that the overpayment from 7 January 1982 to 7 October 1987 was recoverable from the claimant.  In doing so, they followed Secretary of State for Social Security v. Tunnicliffe  [1991] 2 All ER 712 (also reported as R(G) 4/91) in which it had been held that section 53 applied rather than section 119 of the 1975 Act but they indicated that they might have found that the claimant had used due care and diligence had section 119 been applicable. In the light of Tunnicliffe, the Commissioner and the Court of Appeal dismissed appeals without giving full reasons.  The claimant's widow and executrix appealed to the House of Lords, contending that Tunnicliffe had been wrongly decided and that section 119 remained applicable in respect of a payment made before 6 April 1987.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	to apply the recovery provisions of section 53 to overpayments resulting from acts or omissions before 6 April 1987 would effectively impose new obligations and liabilities for those past acts and omissions because section 53 permitted recovery from people other than claimants and section 119 had not;
2.	section 53 would also operate unfairly if it were applied retrospectively to claimants, because it would remove the defence of due care and diligence;
3.	for both those reasons, the presumption against retrospectivity should apply and Tunnicliffe was wrongly decided;
4.	benefit paid on or after 6 April 1987 was recoverable under section 53 only if the misrepresentation or failure to disclose occurred on or after that date but there would not be any overpayments to which neither the new or old recovery rules applied as section 16(1) of the Interpretation Act 1978 had the effect that section 119 continued to apply in respect of payments made on and after 6 April 1987 as a result of a failure to use due care and diligence before then.

From 1979 until her retirement in 1992 she paid full rate contributions. However these contributions were not sufficient to entitle her to a full pension. The claimant contended that she was entitled to have her first husbands contributions treated as hers by virtue of section 48 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. It was argued that section 48(3), which provides that where a person has been married more than once only the last marriage counts for this purpose, indirectly discriminates against women and is thus contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC.

Held that:

The claimant reached the age of 60 on 30 June 1990 and claimed retirement pension from that date, including an increase in respect of her husband. She had not been in receipt of an increase in unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or invalidity benefit for him immediately before the date on which she became entitled to retirement pension. The adjudication officer disallowed her claim for an increase in respect of her husband on the ground that she did not satisfy the requirement in s. 45A(1) of the Social Security Act 1975. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal. It was common ground that s. 45A of the 1975 Act discriminated against women as a married woman seeking an increase in respect of her dependent husband had to fulfil additional conditions over and above the condition that a married man seeking an increase in respect of his dependent wife had to fulfil under s. 45 of the Act. But in view of the decision of the Commissioner in R(P) 3/88 that this inequality of treatment did not breach Council Directive 79/7/EEC, the tribunal disallowed the appeal. The Commissioner, to whom the claimant then appealed, referred the case to the European Court of Justice. 

The Court held that: 
the discrimination at issue fell within the derogation provided for in Article 7(1)(d) of the Directive. Where a Member State had previously provided for increases in old age benefits in respect of a dependent spouse to be payable only to men, it could still rely on the derogation permitted by Article 7(1)(d) if it subsequently introduced measures which had the effect of reducing (although not abolishing) the unequal treatment. To hold otherwise would be incompatible with the purpose of the directive which was concerned with the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment.

On 30 April 1992 the claimant left the United Kingdom to reside in Spain.  An adjudication officer then reviewed the decision awarding him retirement pension and decided that he was no longer entitled to this because of Articles 9(3) and (6) of the 1983 Order.  A tribunal however held that having regard to Article 51 of the Treaty of Rome payment of the retirement pension was not prevented because of a change of the country of residence within the European Economic Community.

Chief Adjudication Officer C-31/90 and C-410/92 ECJ,,"Severe disablement allowance - whether transitional provisions from non-contributory invalidity benefit were contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC and discriminatory - whether restrictions on backdating a claim were contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC and discriminatory

The claimant gave up work to care for her daughter. When her daughter left school, the claimant was required to be available for employment, and began to apply for work. However, before she could get a job, she became incapable of work and was awarded non-contributory invalidity benefit. She continued to receive this benefit until she began to cohabit with her partner. Entitlement then ceased because she was unable to fulfil an additional household duties condition imposed on women who cohabited. 
From 29 November 1984, non-contributory invalidity benefit was replaced by severe disablement allowance. Those claimants who were entitled to non-contributory invalidity benefit immediately prior to its abolition were automatically entitled to severe disablement allowance. On 17 August 1987, Mrs. Johnson applied for severe disablement allowance, arguing that she would have been entitled to non-contributory invalidity benefit at the material date had she not been required to fulfil the additional household duties condition, which had been held by the European Court of Justice to be discriminatory. She sought to rely upon Council Directive 79/7/EEC. Her claim was rejected by an adjudication officer and by a social security appeal tribunal. The claimant appealed.
A tribunal of Commissioners referred questions as to the effect of Council Directive 79/7/EEC on those facts to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.
Held, by the European Court of Justice, sitting on 11 July 1991, that:
1.	a person who has interrupted his or her working life to look after a child was not a member of the working population within the meaning of Article 2 of the directive;
2.	however, a person is a member of the working population if he or she has begun to seek employment, regardless of whether he or she originally left the labour market to look after a child or was previously never part of the labour market;
3.	such a person will be covered by the directive if any of the risks in Article 3 (including becoming incapable of work) materialise whilst seeking employment;
4.	whether a person is seeking employment when one of the Article 3 risks materialises is for the national court or tribunal to decide;
5.	a transitional provision which makes entitlement to severe disablement allowance dependant on a prior claim for non-contributory invalidity benefit perpetuates the discriminatory effect of the household duties condition for that benefit, and is contrary to Article 4. Where female claimants are disadvantaged by the provision, it should be disapplied;
6.	Article 4 is directly effective, and can be relied upon by a claimant in national proceedings.
The Court remitted the case to the tribunal of Commissioners. The Commissioners found that         Mrs. Johnson was part of the working population when she became incapable of work. Applying the courts judgment, the tribunal decided that she was entitled to severe disablement allowance. Entitlement was backdated to twelve months before date of claim pursuant to section 165A of the Social Security Act 1975, which did not allow for further backdating.  The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which made a further reference to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on whether the limitation on backdating was contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC.

Held, by the European Court of Justice, sitting on 6 December 1994, that:
1.	the restriction on backdating was not contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC as it did not make impossible the exercise of rights under Article 4, but merely limited the arrears which were payable when a claim relying on the directive was made;
2.	the restrictions were not less favourable than those applied to purely domestic cases.

Graham and others C-92/94,,"Discrimination on grounds of sex - invalidity benefit - whether unequal age conditions linked to different pension ages for men and women contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC

The claimant became incapable of work at the age of 58 and was paid sickness benefit and then invalidity pension at the standard rate.  When she reached pensionable age (60 for a woman but 65 for a man), the rate at which her invalidity pension was paid was reduced to the rate at which she would have been entitled to retirement pension had she not deferred her entitlement to it.  Her appeal to a tribunal was dismissed and she appealed to a Commissioner, arguing that, because a man of her age in her position would have continued to be paid invalidity pension at the standard rate for a further five years and, furthermore, would have been entitled to the lowest rate of invalidity allowance which was payable to a person who had become incapable of work when more than five years below pensionable age, she had been the victim of discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC.  The adjudication officer argued that the discrimination was lawful because Article 7 of the directive permitted Member States to exclude from the scope of the directive the determination of pensionable age and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits. The Commissioner allowed the claimants appeal, holding that she remained entitled to the standard rate of invalidity pension and also that she was entitled to the lowest rate of invalidity allowance.  The Secretary of State for Social Security and the Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal who referred questions arising in the case and in two others (on appeal from CS/92/1992 and CS/79/1992) to the European Court of Justice.
Held that:
1.	where a Member State prescribes different pensionable ages for men and women for the purposes of granting old age and retirement pensions, the scope of the permitted derogation allowed as the possible consequences thereof for other benefits was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under the other benefit schemes, which were linked to the difference in the pensionable age and were objectively necessary in order to avoid disturbing the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure coherence between the retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes (paras. 11 and 12);

2.	since invalidity benefit was designed to replace income from occupational activity, there was nothing to prevent a Member State from providing for its cessation and replacement by a retirement pension at the time the recipients would in any case stop working because they have reached pensionable age (para. 14);

3.	the derogation also extended to differences between the rates of invalidity pension payable to men and women from the time they reached pensionable age and with regard to the difference between the qualifying dates for the grant of invalidity allowance (paras. 19 and 20).

In R v. Social Security Commissioner ex p Akbar (28 October 1991) (Appendix), Hodgson J held that the word temporarily in regulation 2(1) of the Social Security Benefit (Persons Abroad) Regulations 1975 should be given its primary meaning of not permanently. The Commissioner held that he was bound by a decision of the High Court on judicial review in its entirety and allowed the claimants appeal. The adjudication officer appealed to the Court of Appeal

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while not wishing to cast doubt on the correctness of the decision in Akbar itself and agreeing with Hodgson J that an absence may be temporary even though the intended date for return remains uncertain, for the purpose of construing regulation 2(1) of the Social Security Benefit (Persons Abroad) Regulations 1975 it was wrong to treat the word temporary as being synonymous with not permanent. Whether a person was temporarily absent depended on the facts of the particular case;
2.	in cases involving regulation 2(1):
i.	it was necessary to consider the facts at the date of the relevant decision; this may involve having to make a decision wholly in the future or as to the past. Any period of absence before the decision should be looked at together with the intended or likely period of absence in the future;
ii.	the quality of the absence may change with the passage of time;
iii.	the burden of proof that he is or was temporarily absent is on the claimant;
iv.	the claimants intention is relevant, although not decisive;
v.	an absence may be temporary even though no date is fixed for the claimants return but the word temporary does contemplate that the absence is for a limited period only. An absence for a matter of years is unlikely to be temporary;
vi.	with regard to paragraph (b) of regulation 2(1), whether the claimants absence was or is for the specific purpose of being treated for incapacity is also a question of fact.

The claimant had originally claimed supplementary benefit in 1970. Subsequently, he decided to apply retrospectively for certain additional requirements. On 10 May 1991, he made an application stating that he wished to make a late appeal against the first decision which awarded supplementary benefit to him. A procedure had been adopted whereby all late appeals of this type should be dealt with using a notional decision date. Therefore the claimants application was put before a chairman under cover of a form which gave the date of the decision appealed against as 1 January 1991. The chairman agreed to the appeal being admitted out of time. When the case came before a social security appeal tribunal, the presiding chairman expressed doubts about the procedure that had been followed, but both the claimant and the adjudication officer indicated that they had no objection to it. The tribunal proceeded to deal with the case. The adjudication officer appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
1.	the wording of the appeal did not satisfy the requirement in regulation 3(5) of the Social Security Adjudication Regulations 1986 to give sufficient particulars of the decision appealed against to enable that decision to be identified. Because of this, the application for the appeal to be heard out of time was invalid (para. 12);
2. 	the use of a fictitious decision date was a material irregularity which rendered the decision to grant leave out of tire a nullity (para. 12);
3. 	where a social security appeal tribunal lacks jurisdiction, it cannot acquire jurisdiction through the consent of the parties (para. 13).

The tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision that the claimant was not entitled to either supplementary benefit or income support on the basis that she had misrepresented the amount of capital held by her and that, as a result, an overpayment of each benefit had been made which was recoverable from her estate. The executor of the claimants estate appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	applying Plewa v.

The claimant was awarded a payment by his employer following his dismissal without notice for gross misconduct. The adjudication officer decided that the payment was compensation and that there was an ineligible period within the meaning of regulation 7 of the Social Security (Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit) Regulations 1983. The tribunal found first, that although the payment was expressed to be made ex gratia in acknowledgement of 28 years past service and equalled net pay for twelve weeks (the period of notice to which the claimant was entitled unless dismissed for misconduct), it was nevertheless compensatory and would not have been made but for termination of employment; and secondly, that it did not fall within the exception in regulation 7(6)(c) as it was not an emolument of the employment which accrued under the contract of employment before termination. The tribunal went on to base the ineligible period on the period of notice to which the claimant would have been entitled. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was correct to decide that the payment was compensation because the mere fact that the payment was calculated by reference to the period of notice to which the claimant would have been entitled if he had not been dismissed for misconduct could not by itself make it a payment which accrued before termination of the employment;
2.	as the claimant was dismissed for misconduct there was no period of notice so that there was no due date as defined in regulation 7(6);
3.	the ineligible period must therefore be calculated by reference to the standard date based on the weekly amount specified in paragraph 8(1)(c) of Schedule 14 to the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 rather than on the claimants net pay.",1,112,295,,

The social security appeal tribunal upheld that decision. The claimant appealed to a social security Commissioner.

Held that:
when the claimant gave notice to leave she thereby terminated her employment and this amounted to a voluntary leaving by the claimant. This was not altered by her employers subsequent action, whether that was to be construed as not requiring her to work out her notice or as a counter-notice.

The claimant was employed in a school as a clerk. The school Easter holiday ran from 15 April 1992 to 4 May 1992. The claimant was not paid for any day during that period except for three recognised holidays (17 April 1992 (Good Friday), 20 April 1992 (Easter Monday) and 4 May 1992). No other days were days of recognised or customary holiday for the claimant. The claimant claimed unemployment benefit on 16 April 1992 and was required to attend the unemployment benefit office to sign on on 27 April 1992 and then on alternate Thursdays. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to unemployment benefit from 17 April 1992 to 23 April 1992 and from 1 May 1992 to 4 May 1992 because those days fell within periods of seven days ending on a Thursday for which her earnings were at least £54 (see regulation 7(1)(o) of the Social Security (Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit) Regulations 1983). It followed that unemployment benefit could not be paid in respect of 16 April 1992 because that was an isolated day of unemployment which did not form part of a period of interruption of employment (see s. 17(1)(d) of the Social Security Act 1975) nor in respect of 24 April 1992, 25 April 1992 and 27 April 1992 because those were waiting days under s. 14(3) of the 1975 Act. Thus unemployment benefit was only awarded for 28 April 1992 to 30 April 1992. The claimant appealed against the adjudication officers decision but a tribunal dismissed her appeal.

Held that:
1.	although regulation 7(1)(o) of the 1983 Regulations could give rise to arbitrary results depending on the claimants signing on day this did not have the consequence that it was ultra vires. Administrative convenience was a legitimate consideration for a legislator, even if it gave rise to some inconsistency (para. 7);
2.	the claimant was not entitled to unemployment benefit for the period 16 April 1992 to 23 April 1992. Her earnings for the seven days ending on 23 April 1992 exceeded £54 and so regulation 7(1)(o) had been correctly applied to the period 17 April 1992 to 23 April 1992 (para. 9);
3. 	however, the claimant was entitled to unemployment benefit for 1 May 1992 and 2 May 1992 (although not 3 May 1992 as this was a Sunday: s. 17(1)(e) of the 1975 Act) (paras. 10-12). The purpose of regulation 3(5) of the Social Security (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1978 (earnings not to be taken into account for the purposes of regulation 7(1)(o)) was to ensure that generally only earnings received in respect of days within the spell of unemployment were taken into account. Thus the word day in the phrase day in respect of which a claim for unemployment benefit is made in regulation 3(5) did not include the plural. Regulation 3(5)(b) therefore had the effect that the earnings in respect of 4 May 1992 onwards were not to be taken into account when determining entitlement to unemployment benefit for 1 May 1992 and 2 May 1992, as all the six days before 1 May 1992 and 2 May 1992 were days of unemployment.

On 30 July 1993 the child support officer made an assessment which was effective from 1 August 1993. However, on 19 August 1993 the child support officer reviewed this decision under section 19 of the Child Support Act 1991 on the ground that it had been based on a mistake as to a material fact, namely the absent parent's housing costs, and made a new assessment with effect from 1 August 1993. On 1 September 1993 the parent with care applied for a further review under section 18 of the Act.  A fresh assessment was made, also with effect from 1 August 1993.

A tribunal allowed his appeal in part but rejected his argument that the child support officer was not entitled to make an assessment that was effective during the three year period.

A parent with care not in receipt of benefit made an application for child support maintenance under section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991 in respect of two children, a girl and a boy. A child support appeal tribunal, determining an appeal by the absent parent, ruled that the child support agency did not have jurisdiction to make an assessment for the girl until the end of a transitional period, which in this case was due to end on 7 October 1996, on the ground that there was a maintenance order or written maintenance agreement in force in respect of that child, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Child Support Act 1991 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1992, SI 1992 No. 2644. (That provision was subsequently replaced by section 4(10) of the Child Support Act 1991 as inserted by section 18(1) of the Child Support Act 1995, which prevents consideration of an application under section 4 at all where there is a maintenance order or written maintenance agreement in force in respect of the child). The child support officer appealed to the Commissioner contending that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide that question, it being a matter solely for determination by the Secretary of State when deciding whether an application is effective under regulation 2(4) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992, prior to the passing of the application to a child support officer to carry out the maintenance assessment. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that: 
1.	the requirements of an effective application for the purposes of  regulation 2(4) and (5) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 are no more than that the maintenance application form is completed in accordance with the Secretary of States instructions in the form and signed by the applicant (para. 10);
2.	the words .  no application may be made at any time when ... there is in force a maintenance order or written maintenance agreement  ... mean no more than that section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991 is not available to a parent with care not on benefit if there is in force a maintenance order or written maintenance agreement. It is no more than a convenient way of saying that section 4 does not apply to such a person. It does not mean that an application for a maintenance assessment on the appropriate form cannot be filled up and sent to the Secretary of State. Once such a form is received by the Secretary of State, the provisions of regulation 2(4) and (5) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 apply and the application is deemed for that purpose to be effective as soon as the form is filled up and the printed instructions therein have been complied with (para. 13);
3.	[under the legislation in force at the time] it is for the child support officer to make a decision on whether a relevant maintenance order or written maintenance agreement is in force, which decision may be the subject of an application for review under section 18 of the Child Support Act 1991 and once a child support officer has given a review decision under section 18 then if either party is dissatisfied they can appeal in the normal way to a child support appeal tribunal (para.15).",1,31,42,,

However, the tribunal rejected the absent parents contention that the Secretary of State, when considering whether to require the parent with care to authorise him to take action to recover child support maintenance, should have enquired of the absent parent as to his views, and that by not doing so, the Secretary of State had failed to have regard to the welfare of the child contrary to section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991.

Before a maintenance assessment was made pursuant to section 11 of the Act, the alleged absent parent (who disputed paternity of the children) threatened to kill the person with care if the Child Support Agency continued with the application.

The person with care appealed, but the tribunal dismissed her appeal.  She appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

Section 2 applies only where the child support officer is exercising a discretionary power and not where he is under a duty to act (paras. 17 to 20);
2.	if the child support officer has been given inadequate financial details by an absent parent, but chooses not to make an interim assessment pursuant to section 12 of the Child Support Act, he is still under a duty to make a maintenance assessment under section 11.  He may seek information elsewhere or may make reasonable estimates (paras. 19 to 21).
The Commissioner further gave guidance that:
(i)	Case F, section 26(2) of the Child Support Act 1991, only applies to proceedings where it is open to the alleged parent to apply to have a finding of parentage set aside. Such a finding can be made in proceedings where parentage is not itself in issue. Setting aside an adjudication made in these proceedings will not always imply a finding as to parentage. Where it does not, it may then be necessary for an application to be made to a court pursuant to section 27 of the Act to obtain a declaration on parentage (paras. 22 to 24);
(ii)	where parentage is denied and the case does not fall within any of the cases in section 26(2), a maintenance assessment cannot be made but the child support officer should offer both the Secretary of State and the person with care the opportunity of making an application to a court under section 27 before deciding to refuse to make a maintenance assessment (para. 25).

On 20 October 1994 a tribunal found as a fact that the father had a repayment rather than a pension mortgage and they remitted the case back to the Secretary of State to arrange for a child support officer to make a fresh assessment.  On 1 May 1995 the child support officer applied to the tribunal for further directions under regulation 13(4) of the Child Support Appeal Tribunal (Procedure) Regulations 1992, stating that he believed the father to have a pension mortgage.  On 17 July 1995, without an oral hearing, a differently constituted tribunal clarified the decision of the first tribunal and stated that the fathers mortgage was a pension mortgage and that there was evidence that he had two pension policies. The father appealed on the basis that he had a repayment mortgage and not a pension mortgage and that he only had one pension policy.  

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	directions under regulation 13(4) amounted to a free standing decision and might be the subject of an appeal independently of the original decision (para. 9);
2.	regulation 13(4) enabled a tribunal to resolve an ambiguity in their original decision but it did not permit a tribunal to give directions which were inconsistent with those given originally given (para. 11);
3.	the application under regulation 13(4) had been misconceived and the child support officer was obliged to make a maintenance assessment in accordance with the directions given by the first tribunal (paras. 1 and 12);
4.	a child support officer had no power to review a decision of a tribunal but had the power to review any assessment made following the remission of the case by the tribunal and, therefore, a child support officer who believed a tribunal to have made a mistake of fact was obliged first to make an assessment consistent with the tribunals decision and then immediately consider whether it might be reviewed (para. 15);

On review, a child support officer made an assessment with effect from 13 May 1993.  Both the mother and the father separately appealed against the decision. The mothers appeal was heard in her absence on 21 October 1994, although the father attended and persuaded the tribunal that the assessment should be effective from 17 July 1993 by virtue of regulation 3(5) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992 because, on 15 July 1993, the father had been ordered by a court to pay maintenance to the mother.  With a direction to that effect, the tribunal remitted the case to the Secretary of State.  The fathers appeal was heard in his absence on 9 January 1996 by a differently constituted tribunal with the mother present.  That tribunal decided that they had no jurisdiction to interfere with the findings of the first tribunal and so expressed no view as to the effective date of the maintenance assessment.  Nonetheless, they too remitted the case to the Secretary of State.  The mother appealed, the Commissioner having treated her application for leave to appeal as an application for leave to appeal against both decisions.

Held, allowing both appeals, that:
1.	the two appeals against the child support officers decision should have been heard together;
2.	the effect of the first tribunals decision was to cause the fathers appeal to lapse and to deprive the second tribunal of jurisdiction to decide anything;
3.	the first tribunal had erred because the court order was not an order with respect to the children and, furthermore, was not in force when the maintenance assessment was made on 13 July 1993, so that regulation 3(5) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992 did not apply.

The father of the qualifying child was given financial assistance by his employer to enable him to buy the former matrimonial home.  He received an additional housing costs allowance payable for nine years at a variable rate, which was not subjected to tax.  He also received an advance of salary, which he was required to repay by monthly instalments.  When he separated from his wife, she remained in the former matrimonial home.  He bought another house and continued to receive the allowance and to make the monthly repayments of the salary advance.  The child support officer treated the repayments of the salary advance as income of the mother received in respect of her housing costs.  On the fathers appeal, the child support appeal tribunal decided that, in assessing his earnings, the additional housing costs allowance should be disregarded under paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 as an advance of earnings or a loan, and that the repayments of advance salary should be deducted from his assessable income if shown to be made in respect of housing costs.  The mother appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as the father was not liable to repay the additional housing costs allowance, it was not an advance of earnings or a loan within paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 (para. 5); 
2.	a decision by the Inland Revenue not to tax an allowance was not conclusive as to whether the allowance should be excluded from the scope of earnings for the purposes of child support maintenance by virtue of paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 1 to the 1992 Regulations as being in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his employment (para. 7);
3.	while one purpose in buying the former matrimonial home was doubtless to enable the father to work in Greater London, another purpose must have been the provision of a reasonably pleasant home for the proposed occupiers and therefore the additional housing cost allowance was not paid in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the father's employment and it was to be treated as part of the husbands earnings for the purpose of calculating his liability for child support maintenance (para. 8);
4.	the monthly repayments of the advance of salary did not fall within any of the sub-paragraphs of paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 to the 1992 Regulations and were therefore not made in respect of housing costs of either parent and should neither be deducted from the father's income nor treated as income of the mother (paras. 12 to 14).

The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the tribunal failed to consider all the relevant periods.

Maintenance assessment - maintenance enquiry form not completed - whether maintenance assessment may be made

Maintenance assessment - children at boarding school - whether father or mother providing day to day care

The mother of two sons, who boarded weekly at school, applied on 21 August 1993 for a child maintenance assessment.  The father did not complete the maintenance enquiry form, arguing that he was not the absent parent in respect of either of the boys.  Both parents satisfying the basic conditions for entitlement to child benefit, the Secretary of State, in exercise of his discretion, determined that the father should have priority of entitlement in respect of the elder son and the mother in respect of the younger son.  In consequence, in a decision issued on 13 March 1994, an adjudication officer decided that the mother remained entitled to child benefit in respect of the younger son from 23 August 1993. On 13 March 1994 the younger son went to live with the father and he was thereafter the person with care of both boys.  On 4 May 1994 a child support officer decided that the father was liable to pay child support maintenance in respect of the younger son from 12 November 1993 to 13 March 1994, but that an assessment could not be made because the father had not returned the maintenance enquiry form.  The mother was told that, although the father had failed to return the maintenance enquiry form, no interim maintenance assessment could be made because, by the time it had been determined that the father had been an absent parent he had ceased to be one.  The mother applied unsuccessfully for a review and then appealed.  The child support appeal tribunal held that the father was the absent parent of the younger son for the period 12 November 1993 to 13 March 1994 and directed that a maintenance enquiry form be issued to enable an assessment to be made.  The father appealed, contending that he was not the absent parent of either of the children.  The mother contended that he was the absent parent of both children.

Held, setting aside the tribunals decision but substituting a decision to the effect that a maintenance assessment should be made on the basis that the father was the absent parent of his younger son from 12 November 1993 to 13 March 1994, that:
1.	a retrospective interim maintenance assessment could not be made in respect of the period up to 13 March 1994 because the notice of intention to make such an assessment required by section 12(4) of the Child Support Act 1991 had not been given before that date, when the father became the person with care of the younger son (paras. 8 to 12);
2.	(obiter) the child support officer could have given notice of intention to make an interim maintenance assessment before the question of whether the father was an absent parent had been resolved so that, when resolved, an assessment with retrospective effect could have been made (para. 13);
3.	the fathers failure to complete a maintenance enquiry form did not prevent the child support officer from making an ordinary maintenance assessment because the relevant information could be obtained from other sources (paras. 14 and 15);
4.	in deciding which parent had day to day care of children during term-time, a broad brush had to be applied, having regard to the actual pattern of contact at week-ends and holidays but bearing in mind that that might be influenced by the proximity of one parent to the school and that the issue must be determined on the hypothesis that the children were not at a boarding school (para. 21);
5.	on the facts of the case, the sons term-time nights should be attributed to each parent so that, overall, each might be regarded as providing day to day care to the same extent, with the result that, for the period from 12 November 1993 to 13 March 1994, the mother was the absent parent in respect of the elder son for whom the father received child benefit and the father was the absent parent in respect of the younger son for whom the mother received child benefit (para. 22).",1,41,43,,

He also paid the two children £20 per week pocket money.  He appealed to the Commissioner against the decision of a child support appeal tribunal, contending that in determining his appeal against the maintenance assessment, the tribunal had failed to take account of his payments towards the mortgage and by way of pocket money.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the mortgage payments and pocket money could not be taken into account in the maintenance assessment because the formula simply did not allow crediting of that nature;
2.	crediting the absent parent with any part of the mortgage payments or pocket money he had paid went to enforcement of payment due under the maintenance assessment, and that was a matter for the discretion of the Secretary of State alone, subject only to the right to apply for judicial review.",1,43,,,

A tribunal confirmed the assessment as validly made, notwithstanding that the original claim for income support had not resulted in entitlement to benefit, and gave various directions for a re-assessment.

The tribunal allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the Secretary of State with directions for review and recalculation of the maintenance assessment. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner against the tribunals decision that his council tax liability, the amount of which was accepted as relevant in calculating his protected income, was not relevant as a housing cost in assessing his exempt income under the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	some restriction required to be recognised in interpreting the meaning of the words in paragraph 1(g) of Schedule 3 of the regulations. Although paragraphs 4 and 6 of Schedule 3 imposed certain conditions relating to housing costs and rendered certain costs ineligible, neither of those paragraphs could be considered except in relation to an item which fell within the list of housing costs in the regulations;
2.	regulations 9(1)(b) and 11(1)(b) dealt with housing costs for the purposes of exempt income and protected income, respectively. Both provisions refer to regulation 14 which in turn provides that Schedule 3 is to have effect for determining certain housing costs for both purposes. It was clear that the specific inclusion in regulation 11(1)(j) of a provision relating to council tax was only necessary because housing costs determined under Schedule 3 would not otherwise include council tax;
3.	in terms of regulation 3(5) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992, where a maintenance assessment is made under a court order, the effective date of the assessment is to be two days after the assessment is made. Accordingly, the tribunal had correctly accepted that the effective date in this case was 17 November 1993 being two days after the child support officers decision.",1,39,40,,

Subsequently, the parent with care applied for a maintenance assessment, which was carried out. The absent parent appealed against that assessment to a child support appeal tribunal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal erred in law because they failed to make a finding as to whether the £5,000 was paid to the parent with care for the acquisition of her interest in the home, which on the evidence before the Commissioner was the purpose of the payment (para. 5);

1.	if there were different versions of the record, the obvious method of authentication would be the chairmans manuscript signature. However, the manuscript signature was not an essential requirement. In any event, under English law, a signature does not necessarily need to be in manuscript form provided that the party adopts the printed name as his own. As the chairman had granted leave, it could be inferred that he had so adopted the typed signature on the record. CCS/14/1994 was followed;

The claimant, who was aged 60, had suffered from schizophrenia since she was 16. Her claim for the higher rate of the mobility component of disability living allowance was disallowed.  Her appeal to a disability appeal tribunal was dismissed on the ground that she did not suffer from a state of arrested development of the brain for the purposes of regulation 12(5) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1992, because she experienced lucid intervals. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.  The Commissioner heard expert medical evidence on the nature of schizophrenia, to the effect that 30% of sufferers had experienced neuro-developmental damage which prevented the proper organisation of cells in the meso-limbic system and possibly in the cerebral cortex, and a further 48% of sufferers had experienced some element of neuro-developmental damage.  The medical expert gave his opinion that where such neuro-developmental damage occurred it amounted to arrested development because at some point in the development of the brain there was something missing, which would give rise to consequences resulting in neuro-anatomical abnormality.  He also said that, from a medical standpoint, a person could not be said to be suffering from severe impairment of intelligence unless he was intellectually three standard deviations below the norm (i.e. an IQ of 55 or below), but that it was not characteristic of schizophrenia sufferers that their intelligence was below normal.

Held, setting aside the tribunals decision, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	the fact that a person has lucid intervals did not mean that he or she did not experience arrested development of the brain (para. 7);
2.	on the evidence, the claimant fell within the 30% group suffering from neuro-developmental damage and therefore had suffered from arrested development of the brain (para. 14);
3.	there was no evidence to suggest that the claimants intelligence was anything like three standard deviations from the norm and she was therefore unable to satisfy the severe impairment of intelligence test (para. 16);
4.	to be severely mentally impaired within regulation 12(5) the arrested development of the brain had to result in both severe impairment of intelligence and also severe impairment of social functioning, and as the claimant could not satisfy the test of severe impairment of intelligence, there was no need to investigate in addition whether she suffered from severe impairment of social functioning (para. 17).",1,92,,,

The claimant suffered from osteoarthritis, superventricular tachycardia and anxiety. She claimed both components of disability living allowance but her claim was disallowed. On appeal the tribunal upheld that disallowance.  The tribunal found that the claimant was still able to walk 150 yards slowly with a normal gait and little pain. In their reasons they said Nonetheless it was clear on her evidence that she was able to walk 125 metres with one stop and without the use of a walking stick. We are satisfied that she will walk slowly for the distance but with normal gait and with some discomfort but not severe pain. In our view this does not come within the definition of virtually unable to walk. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner with regard to the mobility component only on the ground that the tribunal had applied an incorrect interpretation of severe discomfort and pain and had not adequately explained its reasoning.  The parties disagreed on whether pain was a lesser test than severe discomfort.

Held, allowing the claimants appeal:
1.	pain was medically defined as encompassing a wide range of  intensities caused by stimulation of functionally specific peripheral nerve endings. Discomfort was not medically defined.  Its ordinary meaning was the condition of being uncomfortable, uneasiness and thus might have different causes from pain. It described the sensation experienced from lesser levels of pain. Severe was an evaluative term which might be contrasted with moderate or mild. Thus mild pain might not by itself cause a sufficient level of sensation to be severe discomfort. A tribunal must decide for itself whether there is severe discomfort considering all the evidence taking into account other factors causing discomfort in addition to the pain (Cassinelli v. Secretary of State for Social Services (CA 29 November 1991) (reported as R(M)2/92) considered);

The claimant was awarded disability living allowance at the lower rates for both the 
care and mobility components from 6 April 1992. On 22 March 1993, he applied for a review, but was unsuccessful.
On appeal, a tribunal increased his award of the care component to the middle rate, applying Mallinson v. Secretary of State for Social Security, decided by the House of Lords on 21 April 1994 [R(A) 3/94]. Although they found that the claimant had met the conditions of entitlement since 6 April 1992, they considered that section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 precluded them from making an award earlier than the House of Lords decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
The Commissioner found that the tribunal had erred in restricting entitlement to the date of the decision in Mallinson v. Secretary of State for Social Security. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held (Hobhouse LJ dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the restriction on the date from which a revision of benefit entitlement on review can take effect contained in section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 applies where, in consequence of the decision of a Court or Commissioner, a decision on benefit entitlement is reviewed on the basis that it is erroneous in law;
2.	a review is not carried out in consequence of the decision of a Court or Commissioner within the meaning of section 69 where it has already been applied for by the claimant before the date of that decision, and is therefore not subject to restriction under that section.  In so deciding, the Court endorsed the approach and conclusions of the Commissioner;
3.	as the claimants application for a review pre-dated the decision in  Mallinson v. Secretary of State for Social Security, his benefit entitlement was governed by that judgment from 6 April 1992.

The decision which the Commissioner substituted for the tribunals, that the claimant was entitled to the middle rate of the care component of disability living allowance from 6 April 1992, was undisturbed by the Court.

Two of the claimants children were placed in local authority accommodation but no care order was made.  An adjudication officer held that the claimant was not entitled to child benefit in respect of them because paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 9 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provided that there should be no entitlement in respect of a child who is in the care of a local authority in such circumstances as may be prescribed and regulation 16(5)(f) of the Child Benefit (General) Regulations 1976, as amended, provided that one such circumstance was where accommodation was provided under section 20 of the Children Act 1989.   The decision was upheld by a tribunal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that, since the enactment of the Children Act 1989, there had been a distinction between care provided by a local authority following the making of a care order and the provision of accommodation under section 20, that paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 9 to the 1992 Act referred only to the former situation and that regulation 16(5)(f) was therefore ultra vires.  The Commissioner dismissed her appeal and the claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the 1976 Regulations were initially made under the Child Benefit Act 1975 at a time when care referred to both care under a court order and voluntary care and, therefore, being in the care of a local authority in the 1975 Act could have had two possible meanings, either referring to those two kinds of care or referring to the ordinary natural meaning of care when, by whatever route a child is being cared for by a local authority, the child is in the care of the local authority;
2.	Parliament had not intended to change the law relating to child benefit by passing the 1992 Act, which was a consolidation Act, or by enacting the Children Act 1989, under section 105 of which being in the care of a local authority was defined as being in their care by virtue of a care order but under section 20 of which the substance of voluntary care also survived;
3.	the phrase in the care of a local authority in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 9 to the 1992 Act did not have the same meaning as in section 105 of the Children Act 1989 but had one of the two possible meanings the phrase had had in the 1975 Act and it was not necessary to decide which (although the Court inclined to the ordinary and natural meaning).",1,7,,,

The claimant, who was entitled to child benefit in the United Kingdom, moved with her husband and children to live in the Irish Republic. She qualified for child benefit in the Republic but the rate of the benefit there was lower. Her entitlement to the higher rate under the United Kingdom legislation ceased eight weeks after she and the children moved out of the country. She claimed to be entitled to continue receiving the higher rate by the direct effect of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 which provides for continuity of certain social security benefits for employed persons and members of their families moving within the Community. It was common ground that she was entitled to this if either she or her husband was in receipt of a United Kingdom social insurance pension within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71. The claimants husband, a former serviceman, was partly disabled and in receipt of a service pension which included an invalidity supplement. His disability also entitled him to United Kingdom invalidity benefit but by virtue of regulation 6,  Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979; no invalidity benefit was payable to him as the service invalidity supplement was greater. 

A tribunal confirmed the adjudication officers rejection of her claim on the ground that the only benefit being received was her husbands service pension, which was not a benefit within Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal and substituting a decision in favour of the claimant, that:
1.	the claimant and her husband could not rely on Article 73 of the Regulation, which applies where a worker in one member State has his or her family residing in another (para. 16);
2.	war or service pensions are not generally within the meaning of  pensions for old age, invalidity or an accident at work in Article 77 of the Regulation, since they depend on a particular occupational scheme and form of service and are not part of the general scheme of social insurance benefits within the scope of the Regulation as defined by Article 4 (para. 19) (R(F) 1/94 followed);
3.	however where a person has a present entitlement to a pension for invalidity under the general social security scheme and in fact receives payment equal to or exceeding that entitlement out of public funds under some other scheme which the terms of the social security scheme integrate with itself by making the other payment in effect satisfy the social security entitlement, that person draws a pension for invalidity for the purposes of Article 77 (para. 22);
4.	accordingly while the claimants husband continued to be entitled to invalidity benefit and to receive the amount of that benefit, either out of the national insurance fund or under the overlapping war pension arrangements, she continued to be entitled by the direct effect of Article 77 to have her child benefit brought up to the United Kingdom rate (para. 23).",1,1,119,,

The claimant was a married woman with three children whose husbands income was aggregated with hers for the purposes of family credit.  An adjudication officer decided that she was not entitled to family credit because her income was too high.  The decision was affirmed by a tribunal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner, contending that capital receipts should not be included in the gross receipts of employment when calculating the claimants income for family credit.  In particular she appealed against the inclusion of a loan of £14,712 introduced into her husbands business, £2,150 received by his business from the sale of a motor car and £175 received by her own business from the sale of a computer printer.  The adjudication officer conceded that the business loan had been wrongly included, because it had not be generated by the business, but submitted that the proceeds of sale of the car and the printer had been rightly included.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

2.	the loan of £14,712, if made (as was found by the tribunal) for business purposes, and the proceeds of sale of the car and the printer were all capital, whereas the calculation of the weekly earnings of a self-employed person was expressly confined to that part of his income which constituted earnings (para. 29); 
3.	express words were needed in order to exercise the power to treat capital as income under section 22(9)(d) of the Social Security Act 1986 and nothing in the phrase gross receipts of employment indicated any such intention (para. 32);

The claimants husband was in full-time employment and was paid weekly. The period over which his earnings were to be assessed was the six consecutive weeks immediately preceding the date of claim. The claim was made in the week beginning 23 October 1994. In the final week of the period of assessment he received additionally two weeks advance pay for holiday to be taken after the end of that period. The adjudication officer, relying on regulations 14(1) (as amended from 12 April 1994) and 19(1)(b) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987, included the holiday pay as part of the earnings received in the assessment period and used the whole amount in calculating average weekly earnings. The tribunal allowed the claimants appeal holding that regulation 18(1) of those regulations had the effect that only one third of the final weeks payment should be taken into account. The adjudication officer appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the main purpose of regulation 14 was to fix what was to be the assessment period in any particular case. The requirement in regulation 14(1) that normal weekly earnings were to be determined  by reference to earnings received in the assessment period established the category of payments which were potentially relevant when making the detailed calculation. It was not to be taken as a requirement that all such payments received must be taken into account;
2.	regulation 20 was concerned with the detailed calculation of average weekly net earnings. That regulation specified that the earnings to be taken into account in the case of an employed earner were to be those derived from employment during the assessment period. Regulations 20(1) and (3) required the exclusion from the calculation of earnings received within the assessment period but earned in respect of a pay period outside the assessment period. CSFC/7/1994 was followed albeit that that decision had considered the regulations as they were prior to 12 April 1994. Regulation 20 had not been amended on 12 April 1994 to correspond with the amendment to regulation 14(1);

The claimant was a lone parent who claimed family credit on 26 April 1989, declaring earnings of £487 per calendar month and £60 per week childminding expenses. The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the grounds that her income exceeded the appropriate limit. She appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, arguing that the child minding costs should be deducted in calculating the earnings to be taken account in the assessment. The tribunal allowed the appeal on the grounds that the child minding costs constituted a payment of expenses wholly exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of her duties.
The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner, who gave an interim decision ruling that the tribunal had erred in law and that there was no provision in the family credit scheme allowing for the deduction of the childminding costs. However the claimant contended that the absence of such a provision had the effect that the family credit scheme indirectly discriminated against women contrary to Council Directive 76/207/EEC because it was more difficult for lone parents than couples to avoid having to pay for child care whilst working and the great majority of lone parents were women. On 11th February 1994 the Commissioner referred to the European Court of Justice the question of whether a benefit having the characteristics and purpose of family credit fell within the scope of the Directive. On receipt of their reply, the Commissioner gave a final decision. 

Held, by the European Court of Justice, that:
1.	although social security matters are excluded from Council Directive 76/207/EEC by Article 1(2), a particular benefit comes within the scope of the Directive if it is concerned with any of the subject areas mentioned in Article 1(1) i.e. access to employment, including vocational training and promotion, or working conditions (Jackson and Cresswell v. CAO, appendix 2 to R(IS) 10/91, followed) (para 13);
2.	the concept of access to employment is not limited to matters that obtain before a person finds work. As the family credit scheme is intended to encourage both (a) workers to remain in low paid employment and (b) unemployed persons to take up such employment, for the purpose of the Directive it is concerned with access to employment (paras. 20 to 22);
3.	the concept of working conditions within the meaning of Article 5 of the Directive is not limited to those conditions laid down by or agreed with the employer and can include a benefit necessarily linked to an employment relationship (para. 24);
4.	there was a link between family credit and an employment relationship in that the benefit could only be awarded if there was such a relationship, albeit that the recipient might not be a party to the relationship and that the award, being for a fixed period, might continue after the relationship had ended (para. 23);
5.	a benefit having the characteristics and purpose of family credit therefore comes within the scope of Council Directive 76/207/EEC.
Held, by the Commissioner in his final decision, that:
1.	in order to determine whether a measure that falls within the scope of Council Directive 76/207/EEC is indirectly discriminatory on grounds of sex:
(a)	the test to apply is to consider whether there is a considerable difference in the number or percentage of one sex as against the other in either the advantaged group (i.e. those who can comply with the requirement or condition imposed by the measure) or the disadvantaged group (i.e. those who cannot comply with that requirement or condition);
 (b)	the facts to be considered are those which applied at the time the measure actually affected the claimant (R v. Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith [1995] ICR 889, CA followed) (para. 20);
2.	on consideration of the statistical evidence, the family credit scheme, at the time it actually affected the claimant (i.e. in 1989), was indirectly discriminatory on grounds of sex in that the absence of a provision allowing childminding costs to be deducted in the calculation of earnings worked to the disadvantage of far more women than men (para. 22);
3.	the design of the family credit scheme was justified by reasons that were objective and unrelated to discrimination on grounds of sex. This was because:
(a)	the test to be applied was whether the scheme reflected a legitimate social policy aim of the UK government and was appropriate and necessary to achieve that aim (Nolte v. Landesversicherungsanstalt Hannover [1996] IRLR 225 followed) (para. 24); 
(b)	the aim of the scheme as stated by the government was to ensure that families do not find themselves worse off in work than they would if they were not working (para. 26);
(c)	in judging the appropriateness of the scheme, the following principles should be applied:
(i)	the government had a wide discretion to choose the measures capable of achieving its social policy aim (para. 25);
(ii)	the appropriateness of the choices made by the government had to be judged on the basis of the information available to it when they were made (para. 37);
(iii)	it was not necessary to enquire how or to what extent the policy aim had in fact been achieved (para. 35);
(d)	after appraising the scheme, and taking into account, amongst other things, research evidence showing that in 1989 a lone parent with average childcare costs was better off in work and receiving family credit than unemployed, the Commissioner concluded that the scheme met the test of appropriateness (para. 39);
4.	the absence from the family credit scheme of a provision for the deduction of childcare costs in the calculation of earnings was therefore not precluded by Council Directive 76/207/EEC.",1,106,116,,

The claimant was awarded family credit from 31 December 1991 to 29 June 1992. When calculating entitlement, the gross receipts of her husbands business were taken into account.  This included capital he himself introduced into the business. Subsequently, in Kostansczuk v. Chief Adjudication Officer, it was agreed by the parties that such capital should not be included in the assessment. A consent order to this effect was given by the Court of Appeal on 21 August 1992.
The claimant sought a review of her benefit award, which was refused. On appeal, a tribunal agreed that the original assessment should be reviewed as it had been made in error of law. However, they decided that review was in consequence of the order of the Court of Appeal, which was a relevant determination pursuant to section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Accordingly, no arrears were payable for any period before the date of that determination.
The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the consent order given by the Court of Appeal in Kostansczuk v. Chief Adjudication Officer was not a relevant determination for the purposes of section 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (para. 6);
2.	even if it was a relevant determination, the review was not carried out in consequence of it.  The order, made by consent without argument or reasons, was not binding authority save for the re-hearing of Kostansczuk v. Chief Adjudication Officer itself: CFC/3/1992 [R(FC) 1/97] followed (paras. 5 and 6);
3.	had the tribunal been correct in applying section 69, they were wrong to adopt a two stage approach of revision of entitlement and refusal of arrears.  Section 69 affects the question of whether there should be revision on review at all (para. 8);
4.	as there was no other relevant determination of a court or Commissioner, or other restriction, the original assessment could be revised on review for error of law, and the claimant paid arrears of the increased benefit awarded.

When the Department became aware of the fact that her husband was paying the mortgage on the property, the adjudication officer reviewed the amount of family credit awarded and reduced the weekly payment from £57.50 to £49.06 per week.  He also decided that there had been an overpayment of benefit for 26 weeks from 13 September 1994 amounting to £214.24 which was recoverable from the claimant by reason of her failure to disclose a material fact.  The claimant appealed to the Commissioner contending that she should be treated as living rent free and that the mortgage payments did not constitute income.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:
1.	the payment of the claimants half share of the mortgage obligations constituted payment of income   made ... to a third party and was notional income of the claimant within regulation 26(3)(a) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 (para. 5);
2.	the value of that notional income was only half the total of the repayments as the claimant only had a half share in the property and did not own it outright (para. 6);

It was submitted on the appellants behalf that: (1) the words of section 25 of the Social Security Act 1975 and section 37 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 were wide enough to mean that each of the wives in a polygamous marriage would be the widow of the deceased and each entitled to widowed mothers allowance or to a share of widowed mothers allowance; and (2) the Court of Appeal had a quasi original jurisdiction to permit a challenge to the propriety of the Ministers exercise of his powers to make rules under sections 162 and 166 of the 1975 Act and sections 121 and 175 of the 1992 Act, and when the Departments of Health and Social Security were unified, the Minister acted inconsistently when he made one set of regulations which denied widows pension to the wife in a polygamous marriage yet allowed her an aliquot share under the National Health Service (Superannuation) (Amendment) Regulations 1989.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	section 25 envisaged that if a woman who was widowed was entitled to the allowance, she was entitled to the full allowance and that it was not contemplated that the allowance would be divided between more than one widow. Therefore the allowance must be confined to the widow who is the widow in a monogamous marriage or in a marriage which was in fact monogamous (approving Salmon LJs obiter comments in Imam Din v. National Assistance Board [1967] 2 QB 213);
2.	even if a challenge to the Secretary of States exercise of his powers could be entertained, the application would fail because neither Acts conferred any power on the Secretary of State to divide widowed mothers allowance (per Staughton LJ). It was not irrational for the Secretary of State to lay down a rule for a social security benefit which was different to a rule made for what was effectively a pension scheme for employees and widows.",1,10,297,,

The claimant, who had been convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment for the manslaughter of her husband, claimed widows benefits on his contributions following her release from prison. On reference to the Commissioner under section 4 of the Forfeiture Act 1982 (as amended) of the questions whether the widows benefits were forfeited by operation of law, and if so whether the effect of the forfeiture should be modified,

Held, that:
1.	the forfeiture rule applied.

3.	however this was not a case where it was right to remove the operation of the rule in its entirety; but taking into account the circumstances (in particular that the claimant was doing her best to re-establish herself and provide a stable home base for the children) the justice of the case required a substantial modification by reinstating the widows benefits until the claimant reached pensionable age, after which she would be entitled to 50% of the Category B retirement pension on her husbands contributions instead of losing it altogether.",1,60,298,,

B appealed to a medical appeal tribunal who decided that he was suffering from prescribed disease D4, because there was “some evidence of irritation of the mucous membrane as a result of dust and fumes at work” but assessed disablement at only 1%. G appealed to a medical appeal tribunal who decided that he was not suffering from prescribed disease D4 but from a “severe degree of allergic rhinitis of constitutional origin”. B and G both appealed to a Commissioner who heard their appeals together.
Held, allowing both appeals, that:
1.	the tribunals had erred in considering whether the claimants’ conditions were caused by their work as those “attribution” questions were matters for adjudication officers and were irrelevant to the “diagnosis” questions before the medical appeal tribunals;
2.	in G’s case, the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether the claimant’s condition was produced by dust, liquid or vapour;

The claimant contended that his deafness had been caused by this work. He had also used burners or torches on the steel.

The claimant worked as an analytical chemist for 40 years. His work was at a laboratory bench, primarily involving the filtration and titration of chemicals and metals. The work required repetitive movements of each hand.  On the basis of this work, the claimant claimed disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease A4 cramp of the hand or forearm due to repetitive movements.  After the employers had said that the claimants employment did not involve prolonged periods of handwriting, typing, or other repetitive movements of the fingers, hand or arm the adjudication officer disallowed the claim as not falling within paragraph A4 of Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985.  On appeal, the social security appeal tribunal found that his work involved about 75 movements in each hand per hour, but although they were repetitive and carried out over a prolonged period they were not of the requisite intensity or frequency to compare with handwriting or typing and therefore the employment was not an occupation meeting the requirements of paragraph A4.

The claimant stated that he had suffered an accident at work in 1943. No payments of workmens compensation under the Workmens Compensation Acts had been paid to him and there had been no admission of liability by his employer. In 1994, the claimant made a claim for workmens compensation under the Workmens Compensation (Supplementation) Scheme. The purpose of the Scheme was to supplement compensation by means of a lesser incapacity allowance in respect of accidents which occurred prior to the introduction of industrial injuries legislation in 1948. His claim was refused on the basis that he did not satisfy the requirements set out in paragraphs 2(1) and (4) of Schedule 8 to the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal which refused his appeal but failed to explain his inability to qualify for a lesser incapacity allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner who substituted his decision for that of the tribunal.

Held, refusing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal, while having partially explained the lack of actual entitlement, had failed to explain why the claimants evidence seeking to establish liability and loss of earnings could not be entertained;
2.	Article 5(1) of the Scheme, which dealt with the lesser incapacity allowance, covered three possible cases (para. 7). The first two were clearly inapplicable. The third of such cases applied where a person may be expected to be entitled to workmens compensation. The claimants representative had sought to provide evidence of liability and loss.

On 19 June 1957 a medical board decided the claimant had been suffering from prescribed disease No. 34 (now prescribed disease A8, tenosynovitis) and assessed disablement at 5% from 24 March 1957 to 23 September 1957.  Following a further claim, on 12 March 1986 a medical appeal tribunal decided that he had not suffered from tenosynovitis since 24 September 1957. His appeal to a Commissioner against that decision was dismissed.  Later, the claimant made a further claim, treated as having been made on 16 November 1992, for disablement benefit from 13 March 1986.  An adjudicating medical practitioner decided that the claimant was suffering from tenosynovitis, that it was a recrudescence of an earlier attack, and that disablement should be assessed at 5% for life from 16 August 1992.  The claimant appealed to a medical appeal tribunal.  The tribunal, confirming the decision of the adjudicating medical practitioner, made no reference to recrudescence but found that the claimant had been suffering intermittent attacks of tenosynovitis since 16 January 1957 and assessed disablement at 5% from 16 August 1992 for life.   They considered that they were giving a decision on review under section 47(4) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, and that therefore regulation 62 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995 limited the assessment to a period not exceeding three months before the date of the application.  The claimant appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the claim from 13 March 1986 did not involve a review under section 47(4), which would bring into play regulation 62, because section 47(4) did not apply to a case arising out of an industrial disease if the period under consideration began after the end of any previous period of assessment for benefit; 
2.	the tribunal had therefore erred in deciding that they could not take into account any period exceeding three months before the date of the application and could have made an assessment from any date from 13 March 1986 (the date from which the claimant claimed benefit) although benefit might have been awarded only from a later date.

On 14 September 1984 the claimant claimed disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease A10 (occupational deafness).  Disablement was provisionally assessed at 32% from 14 September 1984 to 13 September 1989.  On 18 December 1989 a Reassessment Medical Board made a final assessment of 50% for life, calculating the degree of disablement by rounding up the hearing loss to the nearest whole figure.  However, on 16 October 1989, paragraph (3A) had been inserted into regulation 34 of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985.  That paragraph provided for a rounding down of any fraction of an average hearing loss where the average hearing loss was over 50dB.  On a reference to them, a medical appeal tribunal applied paragraph (3A) and provisionally assessed disablement at 42% from 14 September 1989 to 13 September 1994.  The claimant contended that the law to be applied was that as it stood on 14 September 1989, that being the date from which the new assessment was to begin.

Held that:
1.	the presumption against retrospectivity did not apply to legislation relating to matters of procedure or evidence.  Provisions concerned with remedies were to be classified as matters of procedure for the purpose of the rules relating to retrospective effect.  Assessments in respect of occupational deafness were remedies and so any amendment of the relevant legislation applied to them retrospectively.  Moreover the fact that regulation 34(1) provided for an exception in relation to claims made before 30 September 1979 also indicated that the amended legislation was to apply retrospectively;

The adjudication officer decided that the claimant did not have good cause for the delay in claiming reduced earnings allowance and so was not entitled to reduced earnings allowance before 3 June 1992.  The claimants appeal to a tribunal was dismissed and he appealed to the Commissioner who allowed the appeal, holding that the fact that there had been no assessment of disablement automatically amounted to good cause for not claiming the allowance.

An adjudication officer refused the claim on the grounds that the claimant had not worked in an occupation prescribed for this disease, as her employment had not involved the use of a hand-held vibrating tool.

It was also evident from the claimants submission and from the chairmans note of evidence that there had been a dialogue between the medical assessor and the claimant. Further, it transpired that the medical assessor had previously assessed the claimant for disability living allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the authorities dealing with the role of assessors (see R(I) 14/51 and R v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Jones [1962] 2 All ER 430) applied equally to medical assessors in incapacity benefit cases;
2.	the function of the medical assessor was not to supply evidence but to assist the tribunal to understand the medical evidence. By entertaining evidence from the medical assessor, which went beyond his function, the tribunal erred in law;
3.	the advice given by the Commissioner in paragraph 51 of R(I) 14/51 was approved;
4.	since the tribunal had not been made aware that the assessor had previously examined the claimant, and since the matter had not been raised by the claimant at the hearing, no error of law had been demonstrated. It was open to the claimant to seek an adjournment which would be considered and determined by the tribunal.",1,275,285,,

The claimant became incapable of work and received benefit, which from 13 April 1995 was incapacity benefit. Subsequently, he was issued with an incapacity for work questionnaire and was also asked to obtain a form Med 4 from his general practitioner. He returned the questionnaire, but the form Med 4 was not produced. Following examination by a medical officer, the adjudication officer decided that the claimant did not satisfy the all work test and benefit was disallowed. The claimant appealed. The tribunal allowed the appeal on the grounds that, in the absence of a Med 4, the adjudication officers decision had been taken on insufficient evidence (having regard to regulation 6(1) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 and regulation 2(1)(c) of the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976). The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the wording of regulation 2(1)(c) of the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 empowered the Secretary of State to request a form Med 4, however it did not oblige him to do so;
2.	where that discretion was exercised so that a form Med 4 was requested, that request was not irrevocable; and if no form Med 4 were produced, then a decision to proceed without it could be taken;
3.	a form Med 4 is not therefore necessary before an applicant can be assessed to see whether he or she satisfies the all work test.

The claimants claim for income support was disallowed on the ground that his capital exceeded the prescribed amount. At that time he had savings of £5,600 and he lived in his own house and owned another house (the house) which was occupied by his estranged wife. The social security appeal tribunal had valued the claimants interest in the house at £10,000, taking the view (the basis for which was unclear) that the claimants wife might have a claim on the house which could amount to at least 50 per cent of the capital value. The Commissioner recorded that the evidence clearly and unequivocally showed that the house was purchased by the claimant in 1941 for the purposes of providing a home for himself and his wife; that the claimant left the house for good in or about 1968; that on the separation it was mutually agreed that the claimants wife could remain in the house for her lifetime; and that the marriage was a Roman Catholic marriage, divorce had not been considered, no question of the division of any property ever arose, but the estrangement was permanent.
The Commissioner directed an oral hearing of the appeal and said I would like in particular submissions on (i) what the interest of the wife is in the house occupied by her and owned by the claimant; and (ii) if that interest is as licensee under an irrevocable licence, whether that interest can be a reversionary interest for the purposes of paragraph 5, Schedule 10 to the General Regulations. CAO v. Palfrey (CA 8 February 1995) [R(IS) 26/95] may be relevant. At the hearing authorities were cited in support of the proposition that where an irrevocable licence is granted or is to be inferred that the occupier is to remain for the remainder of his life or her life undisturbed and that, in turn, may make him or her a tenant for life fore the purposes of the Settled Land Act 1925. A constructive trust is not lightly to be imposed The test  .  is whether the owner of the property has so conducted himself that it would be inequitable to allow him to deny the claimant an interest in the property ... The Court will not impose a constructive trust unless it is satisfied that the conscience of the estate owner is affected (Ashburn Anstalt v. Arnold [1989] Ch 1, per Fox LJ).

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
on the facts noted above the test enunciated by Fox LJ was satisfied with the result that the claimants wife was a tenant for life of the house for the purposes of the Settled Land Act 1925, that she could call for a Vesting Deed vesting the legal estate in her with the appointment of Settled Land Act trustees and that she had all the powers of a tenant for life. Any question of any technical difference between a reversionary interest and an interest in remainder was one of semantics and the claimants interest was a reversionary interest for the purposes of paragraph 5, Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987",1,28,,,

Review - new medical opinion - whether grounds for review

The tribunal held that the adjudication officers decision reviewing the claimants income support was invalid solely because of a reference to regulation 17(4) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, citing CIS/627/1992 in support. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 17(4) requires the review of an indefinite award whenever it becomes apparent that any of the requirements of entitlement are not satisfied both in cases where the award is to be adjusted as well as in cases where entitlement ceases. Commissioners decisions to the contrary, CIS/627/1992, CIS/251/1993, CIS/45/1994, CIS/856/1994 and others which provide that regulation 17(4) only operates when entitlement to a benefit is to be extinguished were incorrect and should not be followed;
2.	regulation 17(4) does not provide a separate and independent jurisdiction for conducting reviews. Its scope is limited to making mandatory a review of a continuing or future award under the normal review powers. It does not establish a separate machinery for review;
3.	there is no special rule against retrospective review applying to cases within regulation 17(4). The extent of any such review will depend on the reasons for the review and the facts of the case;
4.	where a review has been correctly conducted under a statutory power, a reference to regulation 17(4) only will not invalidate that review;
5.	review includes both reconsideration of relevant aspects of the claimants case and also any redetermination as a result of that reconsideration;
6.	while it is well established that a medical opinion which differs from a previous one does not by itself amount to a relevant change of circumstances for the purposes of review, the findings of an up-to-date medical examination and report may well be evidence of an actual change of circumstances which would justify review;
7.	requirements of entitlement means the totality of the requirements attaching to the individual claimants entitlement. Even if only one element ceases to apply to the claimant, a review is required;
8.	while it is preferable that the appropriate provision conferring the power of review is referred to, decisions of adjudication officers should not be held to be invalid because of a reference to regulation 17(4) only.

The claimant was a national of the Republic of Ireland.  In 1991 he went to work in France.  After being made unemployed, he came to the United Kingdom on 4 October 1994 and claimed income support.  His claim was refused, as an adjudication officer found that he was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom.  The claimant appealed, and a tribunal considered whether the claimant was exempt from the habitual residence test under regulation 21(3)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, either because he was a worker for the purposes of Council Regulations (EEC) 1612/68 or 1251/70, or because he was a person with a right to reside in the United Kingdom pursuant to the European Community Council Directives 63/360/EEC or 73/148/EEC.  The tribunal concluded the claimant was a worker for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 by virtue of his employment in France.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a person who has moved from one member state of the European Community to seek employment in another is not a worker for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 (paras. 9 to 11);
2.	a person who ceases to be employed does not necessarily cease to be a worker.  However, in deciding, in relation to one member state, whether a person is a worker for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68, no account can be taken of any work which they have done in another member state; Raulin v. Minister van Onderwijs en Wetenschappen (Case C357/89) [1992] ECR I-1027, applied (paras. 13 to 15); 
3.	European Community nationals are entitled to stay in another member state so as to look for work.  However, this right to reside does not derive from Council Directive 68/360/EEC, but from Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome and Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68; R v. Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Antonissen (Case C-292/89) [1991] ECR I-745, applied (paras. 21 to 24);
4.	Council Regulation (EEC) 1251/70 concerns the right of a person to remain in a member state where they have been employed.  Council Directive 73/148/EEC concerns those who wish to establish themselves in a Member State to carry out activities as self-employed persons.  Neither had any application to this case (paras. 16 and 19);
5.	as the claimant could not bring himself within any of the relevant provisions of European Community law, he could not rely on the exemption from the habitual residence test in regulation 21(3)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.

The Commissioner set aside the tribunal decision, and remitted the appeal for a re-hearing by a different tribunal to consider whether the claimant was habitually resident for any part of the period at issue.  

In case it transpired that the claimant had done some work within this time, the Commissioner drew attention to the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice upon which to decide if claimant had become a worker (para. 31).",1,125,240,,

The tribunal decided that the claimant was not entitled to income support from 6 June 1994 because she and her husband were to be treated as having capital assets worth more than £8,000. Her husband was the legal owner of an acre of land in Jamaica. The land was undeveloped but cultivated by his mother for subsistence purposes. In 1991, for a period of over twelve months, the claimants husband had unsuccessfully advertised the land for sale at the price of £30,000. It was not being marketed at the time of the wifes claim. The tribunal decided that the property could not be disregarded under paragraph 26 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. Premises did not include land with no buildings, which was used only for arable purposes. Furthermore, at the time of the claim, the husband was taking no steps to dispose of the land. The claimant appealed on three grounds: (1) the tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider the land issue, (2) they misconstrued the word premises, and (3) they wrongly rejected the argument that the premises fell within paragraph 26 for, at any rate, six months. The representative abandoned the first argument at the oral hearing.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the claimants resources which been clearly raised in the correspondence, submissions and evidence before them. It was their function, as far as possible, to give the answers needed to dispose of the case once it came before them  (para. 13);
2.	the tribunal erred in giving a narrow interpretation to the word premises. The Commissioner preferred to follow CSB/222/1986, which after consideration of a number of legal authorities showing that premises could have a wide construction, decided that any premises in corresponding supplementary benefit provisions should receive a wide construction. The property to be disregarded included land without buildings, or a mobile home, though not every species of property, as premises had never meant personal chattels, which were dealt with separately under paragraph 10. What was meant by premises in the supplementary provisions seemed to be the same question despite differences in wording about reasonable steps to dispose of the premises (paras. 17 and 18: observations in CIS/673/1993 as to premises in para. 26 not including unbuilt-on land not followed).

The Commissioner set aside the decision. He decided that the land did count as premises and referred the appeal to a new tribunal to decide whether and to what extent the claimant and her husband were taking steps to try and dispose of the land at the time of the claim, and when they first took reasonable steps for the purpose of calculating the allowable period under paragraph 26.",1,19,,,

The claimant, a law graduate, had from October 1993 been attending a bar vocational course. On 10 May 1994 he submitted a claim for income support stating inter alia that he was spending nine to ten hours per week on his studies. Evidence contained in a letter from the Registrar to the Council of Legal Education as to the status of the course included the following: that the bar vocational course is compulsory for those who wish to qualify as a barrister and practice at the Bar of England and Wales; that the school did not formally designate the course as either full or part-time; but that the course required attendance at the Inns of Court School of Law of, on average, 15 hours each week for a total of 30 weeks and in addition it was envisaged that each student would spend approximately 20 hours each week in unsupervised private study. The social security appeal tribunal, accepting the evidence contained in the letter from the registrar, decided that the claimant was a full-time student within the meaning of regulation 61 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and so not to be treated as available for employment and stated that in doing so it had regard to R(SB) 40/83 where it was said that it is the course and not the student which is to be full-time and the number of hours the student actually attends is irrelevant. R(SB) 25/87, which concerned a qualified barrister who claimed benefit during his pupillage, was distinguished. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
in the absence of any contention that the School of Law was not an educational establishment, the course was a course of study giving an ordinary meaning to those words, the length of which could be taken to be 35 hours since time required to be spent outside the formal attendance at the School could be taken to be part of the course as a whole. The course was of a definite length with no possibility of any question of spreading it over a longer, or uncertain, period of time. The appeal tribunal were perfectly entitled to reach the conclusion that the claimant was a student for the purposes of regulation 61 and in those circumstances there was no obligation for them to go on to consider whether the claimant was available for employment.

The appellant began that placement in September 1991 but because of the recession and consequent financial difficulties her employer ended her placement on 11 October 1991. As a result the appellant was without any source of income because she had no earnings from a placement and no student grant during the placement period.

The claimant who was in receipt of income support was said by her local authority to be in arrears with her community charge payments. Paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 4 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 provides for regulations authorising a local authority to apply to the Secretary of State asking him to deduct sums from amounts of income support payable to a person where a magistrates court has made a liability order against [that] person (the debtor)   .  In accordance with regulation 2 of the Community Charge (Deductions from Income Support) (No 2) Regulations 1990 the local authority where the claimant lived applied to the Secretary of State for deductions from the claimants income support of the amount of community charge said to be outstanding. The claimant disputed that there was any sum outstanding. The Secretary of State referred the local authority application to an adjudication officer who determined that there was sufficient entitlement to income support to make the deductions. The claimant appealed, providing evidence showing that two months after the adjudication officers decision her community charge account was in fact in credit. The appeal tribunal accepted the adjudication officers submission that their jurisdiction was limited to deciding whether a reference had been made to an adjudication officer by the Secretary of State and whether the claimant had available income support to meet the deduction. It was not for them to decide whether there was in fact an outstanding amount due from the claimant under a liability order. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
in a case such as the present where the jurisdictional issue of whether the claimant is a debtor is raised on reasonable grounds, the tribunal must decide whether there is a liability order, properly obtained, under which there is outstanding a sum due of the amount sought to be deducted from income support (para. 21); Murdoch v. Chief Adjudication Officer, Court of Session 22 April 1993 (subsequently reported as R(IS) 3/92), distinguished (paras. 23 and 24).

The claimant was in receipt of income support. It came to light that his wife was working twelve hours per week in a shop for which she received £5 cash and goods to the value of £36. It was accepted by the Department of Social Security that £41 was equivalent to comparable employment in the area. An adjudication officer issued a decision altering the claimants entitlement to income support on the grounds that ... the customers wife should be treated as receiving notional earnings. Regulation 35(2)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 provided that (2) Earnings shall not include  (a) any payment in kind;. Regulation 42(6) of the 1987 General Regulations provided that  Where (a) a claimant performs a service for another person; and (b) that person makes no payment of earnings or pays less than that paid for a comparable employment in the area, the adjudication officer shall treat the claimant as possessing such earnings (if any) as is reasonable for that employment ... (subject to some exceptions which do not apply in this case). The appeal tribunal allowed the claimants appeal, deciding that payments in kind were not to be disregarded under regulation 42(6) when considering whether or not a person is paid less for his or her services than that paid for comparable employment in the area. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Commissioner, contending that under regulation 42(6) payments in kind were to be disregarded.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in the phrase no payment of earnings in regulation 42(6) the term earnings had to be defined as in regulations 35 or 37 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, (payments in kind being excluded from the definition of earnings in regulation 35 by virtue of paragraph (2)(a)), and payments in kind were therefore to be disregarded  (para. 11); 
2.	similarly, payments in kind were also to be disregarded when considering the phrase pays less than that paid for comparable employment in the area in regulation 42(6) as the reference to a payment must be taken to mean a payment of earnings (para. 12);
3.	when calculating notional earnings, the test under regulation 42(6) is such earnings (if any) as are reasonable for comparable employment. In cases where there is some cash payment and some payment in kind, any actual cash payment should be deducted from the amount of notional earnings which would have been calculated if no cash at all had been paid, that approach being derived from the inclusion of the word reasonable in regulation 42(6) (para. 13);
4.	however, the inclusion of the term reasonable in regulation 42(6) does not allow for the adjustment of notional earnings where earnings in kind are paid as this would involve the difficult issue of putting a monetary value on payments in kind, instead the regulation operates so as to avoid giving payments in kind an actual value by deeming the claimant to be receiving whatever is a reasonable local rate for the services provided net of any cash earnings actually received (para. 14).

A man aged 55 who had not known of the whereabouts of his father or seen him for 24 years received a telephone call to tell him that his father had died. He was the only surviving relative and felt that he should deal with the funeral and sort out his fathers flat. He claimed a social fund funeral payment. His father left nothing to pay for a funeral.

The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to a payment for funeral expenses because it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the claimant to have accepted responsibility. Regulation 7(1A) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 provides whether it is reasonable for a person to accept responsibility for meeting the expenses of a funeral shall be determined by the nature and extent of that persons contact with the deceased.

The social security appeal tribunal found as fact that the claimant was in receipt of income support and that he took responsibility for his fathers funeral. They allowed his appeal on the basis that paragraph (1A) of regulation 7 had to be read in conjunction with paragraph (1B) so that it did not apply where there was only one close relative of the deceased. Paragraph (1B) provides for a comparison to be made between the nature and extent of the contact of close relatives. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, that:
1.	the tribunal erred in its construction of paragraph (1A). Where the claimant was the responsible person and the only close relative of the deceased, he was nevertheless required to show that it was reasonable for him to accept responsibility for the funeral expenses (para. 8);
2.	the nature and extent of the claimants contact with the deceased is a question of fact and in having regard to the nature of the contact the strength of bond between blood relatives had to be given due weight (para. 10); 
3.	the time element is important in considering the extent of closeness of contact but 24 years estrangement did not erase the contact that the claimant had had with his father in the preceding 30 years (para. 11).

A religious service was held in London and then the coffin was flown to Eire and interred within the family grave. The claimant who was entitled to housing benefit claimed a funeral payment from the social fund. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to a payment because under regulation 7(1)(c) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 it was a condition of entitlement that the funeral took place in the United Kingdom. The tribunal dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner who set aside the decision on the ground that the tribunal had failed to deal with the claimants argument that regulation 7(1))(c) discriminated against Irish nationals contrary to EEC law but the Commissioner rejected that argument. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, who set aside the Commissioners decision on 29 July 1992 (OFlynn v. Chief Adjudication Officer). The appeal was remitted to a Commissioner for a rehearing. The Commissioner adjourned the case pending the reference of four questions to the European Court of Justice for preliminary rulings.

Held, by the European Court of Justice, that:
1.	a funeral payment constituted a social advantage within the meaning of Article 7(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, and migrant workers should enjoy that advantage under the same conditions as national workers;
2.	the condition imposed by regulation 7(1)(c) of the 1987 Regulations could more easily be satisfied by national workers, and therefore indirectly discriminated against migrant workers;
3.	it would be otherwise if the provision were justified by objective considerations, and was proportionate to the legitimate aim of national law;
4.	the justifications put forward by the United Kingdom were not accepted;
5.	consequently, Article 7(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 precluded a provision such as regulation 7(1)(c) of the 1987 Regulations.
Held, by the Commissioner, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the European Court of Justice had decided not only that regulation 7(1)(c) was discriminatory, but also that it was not objectively justifiable;
2.	even if that had not been the case, no objective justification had been proved;

However, the Commissioner held that the claimant was not entitled to income support on the ground that her capital exceeded the sum specified in regulation 45 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (£6,000). His reasoning was that the gift had failed because one of the conditions had not been fulfilled and that the claimant was accordingly beneficially entitled to part of the proceeds of sale of the flat. The amount to which she was entitled was the value of the property less the mortgage repaid together with interest and the expenses of recovering the money from the daughter and, on the evidence, that exceeded £6,000. The claimant appealed against the Commissioners decision on the grounds that there had been a contract, rather than a gift subject to conditions, or, alternatively, that the condition of caring for the claimant was void for uncertainty.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	on the evidence, the Commissioner was entitled to find there had been a gift;
2.	on the true construction of the deed the condition requiring the daughter to look after the claimant was of sufficient certainty to be a valid and effective condition;
3.	the daughter was in breach of that condition and as a result the gift failed and the beneficial interest in the property reverted to the claimant, with the consequence that the claimant had an interest in a capital asset;
4.	the Commissioner was entitled to conclude that the value of that interest exceeded the statutory maximum of £6,000 as it was not necessary in the circumstances to define the value of the interest with absolute precision.",1,28,29,,

The claimants baby daughter died on 26 April 1996. Her funeral was held on 1 May 1996. The bill for the funeral was in the name of the claimants parents, and was paid by them.  On 22 May 1996, the claimant applied for a social fund funeral payment.  A tribunal found that she had accepted responsibility for the funeral, and awarded her a social fund payment.  The adjudication officer appealed.

Held that:
a claimant can accept responsibility for funeral expenses (under regulation 7(1)(e) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987) through an agent.  Provided an agent has the claimants authority to act before entering into the contract, it does not matter if the funeral director believes the agent to be acting on their own account: the claimant (the undisclosed principal) will later be able to assume legal responsibility for the contract (paras. 13 and 14).

In late 1993, the claimant went into a nursing home, and on 1 December 1993 claimed income support through her appointee. On 23 December 1983, she had invested £10,000 in an investment bond with a life assurance office. The surrender value of the bond was linked to the performance of an investment fund and could be realised at any time. There was an option to obtain monthly payments by partial surrender which the claimant exercised. A guaranteed minimum death benefit was payable insofar as the bond was not cashed before the claimant died, but this was substantially below the cash value obtainable during the claimants lifetime. A tribunal decided that the outstanding cash value of the bond should be taken into account as capital for income support. The claimant appealed.

Held that:

1.	the cash value of the bond fell to be disregarded as capital under paragraph 15 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as the surrender value of a policy of life insurance. It was sufficient that the bond contained provisions for payment on contingencies dependent on human life, even if those provisions were peripheral to the main purpose of the bond: CIS/122/1991 and Gould v. Curtis [1913] 3 KB 84 applied (paras. 10, 11, 12(1) and (2));

2.	where a significant amount is invested in such a bond, so that its value falls to be disregarded as actual capital, this operates as a deprivation and an adjudication officer should always consider whether the investment was made for the purpose of securing entitlement to income support then or later. There is no safe period for the purposes of regulation 51(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (para. 12(3)).",1,20,110,,

The claimant, who had been awarded income support in 1991, applied for an award of the care component of disability living allowance at the middle rate on 14 April 1992. On 9 September 1993, an award at the middle rate was made. The claimant sought a review of his award of income support to include the severe disability premium with effect from 15 April 1992. The award was reviewed but not revised. A disability appeal tribunal decided that there were no grounds for review under section 25(1)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner upheld the appeal. The adjudication officer appealed to the Court of Session.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

It was clear that paragraph (a) referred to material facts which were in existence at the time of the decision.

The claimants were women who had applied for political asylum in the United Kingdom. Whilst their asylum claims were being considered, they were treated as persons from abroad under regulation 21(3)(e) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and awarded income support at the 90% urgent cases rate under regulation 70. Neither claimant had ever worked in the United Kingdom, been required to be available for employment or been liable to pay national insurance contributions, but each had been allocated national insurance numbers for benefit purposes. The claimant in CIS/564/1994 was awarded income support at the urgent cases rate from 24 April 1990. A Home Office letter dated 6 October 1990 informed her that her asylum application had been successful but she did not report this to the Department of Social Security until February 1993. Her full entitlement was backdated by twelve months to February 1992 under regulation 69 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1987. The Commissioner granted the claimant leave to appeal against the decision of the tribunal dated 29 November 1990 which confirmed the adjudication officers decision dated 24 April 1990. The claimant argued that she was entitled to full income support throughout her claim because the 1951 Geneva Convention required the United Kingdom to ensure that refugees received the same treatment as nationals in social security matters. In CIS/7250/1995, the claimant was notified by a Home Office letter dated 2 September 1993 that her claim for asylum was successful. She appealed against the adjudication officers decision not to review and award her the full rate before 2 September 1993. The tribunal of 7 June 1995 awarded the claimant the full rate of income support retrospectively to 21 December 1992, twelve months before the date of her review request. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing both appeals that: 
1.	a person was a refugee from the time he fulfilled the criteria contained in the Convention. The determination by the Home Secretary did not make a person a refugee but declared him to be one: Khaboka v. Home Secretary [1993] Immigration Appeals Reports 484 at 489. However, any breach by the United Kingdom of its international obligations under the Convention by withdrawing income support from refugees was not justiciable as the terms of the Convention were not part of domestic law. A breach of the Convention could only be justiciable insofar as the claimants rights under domestic or European Union law had been infringed (paras. 23, 24 and 25);
2.	there was no scope to look at the terms of the Convention to resolve any ambiguity in national legislation since the effect of regulation 21(3) was clear (para. 27); 
3.	the claimants could not rely on Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 for the period prior to 1 June 1992 as income support was not covered by Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71: Hoeckx v. Openbaar Maatschaopeliik Welziin, Kalmhout (case C-249/83)[1985] 973 ECR, Jackson and Cresswell v. Chief Adjudication Officer (cases C-63/91 and C-64/91) [1992] ECR I-4737 and CIS/863/94 [R(IS) 4/99];
4.	to fall within the scope of Article 2.1, a person had to satisfy two conditions, of being employed or self employed and either a national of one of the Member States or a stateless person or refugee residing within such a State (para. 42). Although the claimants might establish that they were refugees residing in the United Kingdom before the Home Office pronounced on their cases (para. 40), they did not fall within the definition of employed or self employed persons or count as insured under Article 1(a)(i) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 (paras. 47 to 48). Thus, they could not rely on the direct effect of Article 1408/71 to avoid or override the clear provisions of domestic legislation.

The Commissioner set aside the tribunals decision in CIS/564/1994 because it purported to confirm an award of income support at the emergency rate for an indefinite period and the weekly amounts had not allowed for child benefit. He substituted his own decision that the full rate of income support was payable from 6 October 1990.

The claimant was following a business administration course that occupied less that 21 hours of study per week and therefore did not affect his eligibility to income support.  The course involved a two week work experience placement based in European Community institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg.  His college paid for his travel and hotel expenses but he was dependent on his income support for living and other expenses.  The maintenance monies paid by the college originated out of the European Social Fund and were administered by the Secretary of State for Employment.  The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to income support while he was absent from Great Britain.  A tribunal dismissed the claimants appeal and he appealed to a Commissioner, arguing that he was entitled to income support by virtue of European Community law. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the money received by the claimant from the college was for his maintenance because it included hotel and travel expenses (para. 10);
2.	the European Social Fund constituted public funds (para. 11);
3.	the payments were transmitted via the Secretary of State for Employment and were therefore made by or on behalf of the Secretary of State for Employment (para. 12);
4.	the claimant was following a course of training ... approved by or on behalf of the Secretary of State for Employment because the Secretary of State had to satisfy himself that the course was within the ambit of the European Social Fund (para. 14); 
5.	the payments were therefore a training allowance within regulation 2(1) of the 1987 Regulations so that, by virtue of regulation 8(1) and paragraph 11 of Schedule 1, the claimant was not required to be available for work and, by virtue of regulation 4(2)(c)(i), he was entitled to income support while temporarily absent from Great Britain;

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law by failing to consider fully the meaning of the words commercial basis. In particular, the guidance from Commissioners decisions, CIS/195/1991, R(IS)17/94 and CIS/754/1991 had not been followed;

4.	intention to make a profit was not an essential element in determining the existence or otherwise of a commercial basis nor was it crucial to establish what action the parents would take in the event of default in making the payments.

The claimant was a French national who came to the United Kingdom on 22 May 1995. On 20 June she entered into an arrangement with a family to act as an au pair, working 13 hours a week in return for £35 per week and free board and lodging. The arrangement ended on 28 July, although it was not entirely clear from the evidence subsequently given to the tribunal whether it was the employer or the claimant who terminated it. 
The claimant made a claim for income support on grounds of unemployment, which was treated as having been made on 31 July. The adjudication officer refused the claim on the grounds that the claimant was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom. She appealed to a social security appeal tribunal and in the meantime entered into a fresh arrangement to act as an au pair from 15 August.
The tribunal refused the appeal on the grounds that on the date of claim the claimant (a) was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom; and (b) was not exempt from the habitual residence rules as a worker as defined in European Union law because her activity as an au pair was not genuine and effective work. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that: 
1.	the tribunal decision was erroneous in law for a number of technical reasons. The Commissioner was therefore entitled to substitute his own decision (para. 8);
2.	by the date of claim, the claimant had acquired the status of a worker for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68 because her activities as an au pair were genuine and effective and not on such a small scale for it to be appropriate to regard them as marginal and ancillary. The claimant had provided services of economic value to her employer in return for remuneration that she needed to provide her with the necessaries of life. The arrangement had been intended at the outset to be long term and had not been entered into as a device to gain worker status (Levin v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1982] ECR 1035, ECJ and Raulin v. Minister van Onderwijs en Wetenschappen [1992] ECR 1027, ECJ applied) (para. 15);
3.	having acquired the status of worker for the purpose of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68, a person who then ceases employment retains that status whilst unemployed and looking for work. It does not matter that the employment was left voluntarily, so long as the circumstances of leaving indicate that the person still intended to remain in the labour market (Lair v. Universitat Hannover [1988] ECR 3161, ECJ considered) (para. 21);
4.	the evidence was that the claimant was available for and actively seeking work from 29 July to 14 August 1995 and had not taken herself out of the labour market. She was therefore to be regarded as a worker for the purpose of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68 during the period of her income support claim and so, in accordance with paragraph (a) of the second definition of person from abroad in regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, she could not be treated as not habitually resident in the United Kingdom.

The claimant was a French national in receipt of income support from 11 June 1992 as a lone parent. She received a letter from the Home Office dated 8 December 1993, which stated that ""in view of the fact that you are in the United Kingdom in a non-economic capacity and that you have become a burden on public funds, the Secretary of State is not satisfied that you are lawfully resident here under European Community law and you should now make arrangements to leave the United Kingdom"". The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was not entitled to income support from 8 December 1993 and the claimant appealed. The tribunal confirmed the adjudication officer's decision that she fell within paragraph (h) of the definition of ""person from abroad"" in regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 because the Secretary of State had required her to leave the United Kingdom. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, by the Commissioner, allowing the appeal, that: 
a person might be ""required to leave"" the United Kingdom under regulation 21(3)(h) even if he is not subject to a deportation order (para. 15). However, the words used in the letter fell ""short of the necessary degree of insistence or compulsion for it to be possible to say that on receipt of the letter the claimant was required to leave the United Kingdom"" (para. 20). 

The Commissioner decided that as there were no grounds for review, the claimant's entitlement to income support did not cease. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed and this appeal was joined with the case of Wolke in the Court of Appeal. Ms. Wolke, a Dutch national, had received a similar letter which concluded ""I should add in that if you do not leave the United Kingdom on a voluntary basis then, in the present circumstances of your case, we will not take steps to enforce your departure from the United Kingdom."" Mr. Justice Popplewell granted a declaration to the effect that Ms. Wolke could not be said to have been required to leave the United Kingdom. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal (Phillips LJ dissenting), allowing the appeals, that: 
although the claimant and Ms. Wolke were not in breach of any United Kingdom immigration rules which would give rise to a liability to deportation, they did not have an enforceable Community right to remain in the United Kingdom. The Home Office letter was a requirement to leave within the meaning of regulation 21(3)(h) because it was authoritative and conveyed a serious instruction. The object of the amendment to regulation 21(3) was ""to enable an adjudication officer to cut off the flow of benefits to an European Economic Area member who had no legal right to be here"". 

The claimant and Ms. Wolke appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, by the House of Lords (Lord Slynn dissenting), allowing the appeals, that:
in the light of the terms of the judgement of the European Court of Justice in R v. the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Antonissen [1991] ECRI-745, a requirement to leave would arise only when the person concerned had been placed under a legal obligation to leave. That would arise when a deportation order or an order for removal under article 15(2) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 had been made after any appeals had run their course. The Home Office letter did not amount to such a requirement, since it did not create a legal obligation to leave",1,172,242,,

The claimant was a widow of 85 or 86 years of age and permanently resident in a residential care home. She was a partner, with her son and his wife, in a farming business, the fixed assets of which included the farm land. She had ceased to be an active member of the partnership but remained entitled to a share in the profits, a proportion of the capital and was jointly and severally liable for partnership losses. The son kept her informed and kept her interest in the business alive, but he did not tell her things that would upset her and she gave him permission to do what he wanted in the business. The farm land itself was vested in the claimant and her son under a trust for sale, by virtue of an assent and a trust deed pre-dating the partnership deed. She claimed income support and an adjudication officer refused her claim on the basis that the farm land was in the joint names of the claimant and her son and by virtue of regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 she was deemed to be entitled to a half share in the open market value of that interest, which after appropriate deductions he found was £34,000, in excess of the capital limit of £8,000. The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal, which allowed her appeal, accepting the claimants argument that the claimants interest in the farm land was an agricultural tenancy and as such a reversionary interest which fell to be disregarded under paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. 

The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner, who held that the tribunal was wrong to find an agricultural tenancy but that the farm land was a partnership asset and should be disregarded as a business asset under paragraph 6 of Schedule 10, finding the claimant to be engaged as a self-employed earner for the purposes of that paragraph. The Chief Adjudication Officer appealed to the Court of Appeal. The claimant issued a cross-notice of appeal accepting that there was not an agricultural tenancy but contending that there was a six month period of notice required in order to dissolve the partnership which created an obstruction to the claimants rights as owner of the land and meant that they were reversionary interests only.

Held, unanimously allowing the Chief Adjudication Officers appeal and dismissing the claimants cross appeal, that:
1.	to come within paragraph 6 of Schedule 10 the claimant must be or have been involved in the business in some practical sense as an earner in the business or be precluded from making any such contribution by reason of infirmity. The precise nature of the requisite involvement is not defined and in each case must be decided individually. However, the fact that the partnership agreement provides for some payment, irrespective of whether the recipient has been engaged or involved in a practical sense, is not of itself enough to show the appropriate level of involvement. A sleeping partner in a business managed and worked exclusively by others does not come within the description of an individual engaged in the business;
2.	the commitment of the claimants assets to the partnership, together with the risk of incurring liabilities, and her allowance from its profits did not constitute a sufficient positive involvement for the purpose of paragraph 6 of Schedule 10;
3.	as a partner in the property the claimant was enjoying her rights of property in the farm and her rights were not deferred or limited by rights enjoyed by anyone else which could prevail over her rights. Her interest in the land was not an interest in reversion.

The Court remitted the case for a fresh valuation of the claimants assets.",1,18,,,

The adjudication officer disallowed the claim on the ground that the claimant was a student because he had been attending a full-time course and was deemed by regulation 61 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1986 to be attending it until the last day of the course. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who allowed the appeal on the ground that the claimant had been dismissed from the full-time course. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner who held that the tribunal had erred in finding that the claimant had been dismissed from the course. However, he dismissed the appeal on the ground that whether or not a claimant was attending a full-time course was to be determined on the facts at the material time.

The adjudication officer decided that the claimant should be treated, under regulation 51(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1986, as possessing notional capital exceeding £8,000 on the ground that the claimant had deprived herself of the capital for the purpose of obtaining income support. The claimants appeal to a tribunal was dismissed and she appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law by reason of their failure to make sufficient findings of fact and to give adequate reason for their decision (para. 5);
2.	the effect of the power of attorney was that the attorney had a general authority to act on the claimants behalf in relation to all her property and affairs and the acts of the attorney became the acts of the claimant, but the attorney was under a fiduciary duty to the claimant and had to act for the benefit of the claimant and not for personal gain (para. 7);
3.	the fact that the claimant might have approved of the attorneys actions was irrelevant in determining the propriety of those actions (para. 7);
4.	as regards the loan of £8,000, it was necessary to determine who in actual fact incurred the indebtedness as the mere fact that the loan was in the attorneys name was not decisive (para. 9);
5.	if the real responsibility was that of the attorney then the money has been paid in breach of her fiduciary duty and the claimant had a chose in action to the value of £8,000 which would constitute actual capital (para. 9);
6.	if the indebtedness was that of the claimant then it was necessary to determine whether the repayment was made with the purpose of securing her entitlement to income support, bearing in mind that there did not seem to be any pressing need to make repayment at the time the loan was discharged, and if the payment was made with that purpose then the claimant would be treated as having £8,000 notional capital (para. 10);
7.	as regards the gifts, the attorney did have power to make gifts provided they were not unreasonable within the meaning of section 3(5) of the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985 (para. 12);
8.	if the gifts were unreasonable then the claimant would have a chose in action which would constitute actual capital (para. 12);
9.	if the gifts were not unreasonable then it was necessary to consider whether the predominant motive was to enable the claimant to claim income support and if that was the case the value of the gifts would constitute notional capital (para. 12);
10.	it was also necessary to consider whether there was any further actual or notional capital available to the claimant (para. 13);
11.	if the claimant was not entitled to income support at the date of her claim, it was necessary to consider whether she was entitled at some later date (para. 14).

The claimant applied for a funeral payment in respect of her late husband. Although the deceased had lived in Birmingham, he was buried in Solihull. The charge for opening a new grave for a person who was not resident in Solihull was greater than the charge for a resident of Solihull and also greater than the charge for a burial in Birmingham. The adjudication officer decided that only the charge that would have been incurred in Birmingham would be allowed. On appeal, the tribunal interpreted the words necessary costs in regulation 7(4)(a) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 so as not to restrict the choice of cemetery in a way that ignores reasonableness or convenience. The tribunal increased the award so that the claimant could recoup the full cost of opening the grave in Solihull. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the expression necessary in relation to costs implied that costs were to be kept to a minimum; 
2.	it was not a requirement of the regulations that the cheapest plot must be obtained however far away and the grave should be within reasonable proximity to the residence of the deceased while he was alive;
3.	where, within reasonable proximity, there were several cemeteries, regulation 7 required the acquisition of the cheapest plot regardless of whether it was the nearest to the deceaseds former home or the most convenient for visitors;
4.	account should be taken of the deceaseds religion and it would not be a proper burial for the deceased to be buried in a cemetery which was inappropriate for a person of his or her religion.

The claimant was a Project 2000 student nurse, receiving a bursary paid from government funds.  Unlike student nurses undertaking the traditional education and training programmes, Project 2000 bursaried students were not employed, and had supernumerary status as defined in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Approval Order 1989.  The claimant did practical work on hospital wards but also attended courses and instruction under the aegis of a university.  Due to illness, the claimant was absent from her course for a period in excess of 28 days, as a result of which her bursary was suspended.  Her claim for income support was disallowed by an adjudication officer but her appeal was allowed by a social security appeal tribunal on the ground that she was not a student attending a full-time course of study at an educational establishment within the substituted definition in regulation 61 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.  The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	although Project 2000 student nurses differed from ordinary undergraduates in that they were not eligible to supplement their bursaries by applying for further financial support and their bursaries could be suspended if they were absent through sickness or accident for more than the specified period nevertheless such a student was a student within the meaning of amended regulation 61 and therefore not entitled to claim income support during the continuance of the course;
2.	on the evidence before them, the tribunal had not been entitled to hold that the claimant was not a student and, contrary to the view of the tribunal, when prima facie the facts pointed to the conclusion that the claimant was a student, the burden of proof was upon her to show that she was not a student and was entitled to income support;

In 1989 the claimant, a widow, was awarded income support. She owned her home on which a mortgage loan of £7,000 was secured, in respect of which the appropriate sum was included in her applicable amount when her entitlement to income support was calculated. The loan was repaid in 1992. She transferred that home to one of her sons and on 1 September 1994 bought another home with the aid of a mortgage loan of £30,000. In November 1994 she applied for her housing costs in respect of the new loan to be paid as part of her income support. From 6 February 1995, the claimant was awarded attendance allowance and had the severe disability premium included in her applicable amount. She reached the age of 75 in May 1995. The social security appeal tribunal upheld the adjudication officers decision that the claimants housing costs could not be included in her income support, because of the application of paragraph 5A of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	having regard to sub-paragraph 3(a) of paragraph 5A of the 1987 Regulations, the claimant was entitled to housing costs in respect of her new mortgage, but only to the extent to which it did not exceed the original £7,000 mortgage; and this was so despite the time gap between the discharge of the former loan and the taking out of the new one, as both events occurred during the same income support period;
2.	the claimant was not a disabled person within paragraph 5A(8) of the 1987 Regulations on the relevant date, 1 September 1994, when the new mortgage was taken out (so as to entitle her to income support housing costs on the entire £30,000) as at that date she did not have included in the applicable amount of her income support any of the premiums listed in that paragraph and it was irrelevant that the awards made from February 1995 were based on the premise that the claimant, by then, had been disabled for six months or that the claimant might have claimed attendance allowance earlier.

The claimant had an award of income support. His wife was awarded the lowest rate of the care component of disability allowance from 6 April 1992 with the consequence that from that date the claimant became entitled to the disability premium of income support, but the usual postcard was not sent by the Disability Living Allowance Unit informing the income support officer of that award. The decision awarding income support was twice reviewed, in February and May 1994, without the award of disability living allowance being taken into account. On 3 August 1995 the claimants representative reported to the local office of the Benefits Agency that the claimants wife had for some time been in receipt of disability living allowance. An adjudication officer reviewed the decision awarding income support on the grounds of change of circumstance and the 1994 review decisions on the grounds that they had been made in ignorance of a material fact but, whilst acknowledging that the award of disability living allowance had rendered the claimant entitled to the disability premium, restricted the backdating of the award of the premium to the period commencing 4 August 1994 applying the twelve month restriction under regulation 63 of the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations 1995. The claimant appealed to the social security appeal tribunal on the ground that regulation 57(2) of those regulations applied and that therefore regulation 63 did not apply. The tribunal allowed his appeal on the basis of findings of fact that (i) the Disability Allowance Unit held a record of the award of disability living allowance and (ii) that the claimant had made disclosure of that award on several occasions to officers in the unemployment benefit office through which his income support was paid, and of their conclusion that those items of information should have been taken into account by the adjudication officer who had conducted the May 1994 review. They also considered that regulation 57(2)(a) probably applied as that information was specific information which the adjudicating authority had before it but had failed to take 
into account. The adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 57(2)(a) and (b) are strict and clearly intended to limit the relaxation of the regulation 63 restriction on review to the two circumstances specified therein and that specification cannot be interpreted so as to allow for administrative failures;
2.	the terms of regulation 57(2)(a) and (b) are not only strict but unambiguous in their strictness so as to preclude invoking Pepper v.

The claimant had taken up an offer of a grant from the local authority for repairs on her house. However, the local authority would only make an initial payment after some work was completed, and would make the final payment after the work had been completed to their satisfaction. The claimant arranged an overdraft facility with which to pay builders before the release of funds by the local authority. Interest payments were made on the overdraft. The adjudication officer decided that an overdraft facility was not a loan. On appeal, a tribunal decided that the authority had met the costs of repairs, and that therefore the overdraft facility was not a loan for repairs. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
the use of an overdraft facility granted specifically to finance building works clearly did fall within taking out a loan, for the purpose of paragraph 8 of Schedule 3, and therefore interest on eligible costs were payable. In the circumstances the loan or loans were for the purpose of carrying out the repairs. The Commissioner did not express a view on whether that would be the case if the claimant merely made use of an overdraft facility available, though not specifically granted, to finance building works. The Commissioner also expressed the view that the same principle would apply to paragraph 7 (interest on a loan to acquire an interest in the dwelling occupied as home).

The claimant suffered from ME and any physical exertion left him exhausted. When exhausted, he was able to rest, and recover within two or three days. A disability appeal tribunal found that, although his walking was impaired and caused him some pain, his ability to walk was not so limited as regards the distance over which, or the speed at which, or the manner in which he could make progress on foot without severe discomfort that he was virtually unable to walk. The tribunal also found that, although exertion did leave the claimant exhausted, it did not result in serious deterioration to his health since, having rested, he would improve. The tribunal therefore rejected his claim to mobility allowance, holding that he failed to satisfy the conditions in regulation 3 of the Mobility Allowance Regulations 1975 [see now, regulation 12(1)(a) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991].

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The claimant was formerly a Church of England clergyman. He was the incumbent of a parish and so resident in a parsonage house. He resigned from his living effective from 30 November 1994 because he objected on conscientious grounds to the Churchs decision to admit women into the priesthood. As a result he received a resettlement grant of £3,780 from the Church of England Pensions Board under a scheme intended to provide for clergy who resigned in such circumstances and in consequence had to give up their accommodation. On 12 December he claimed unemployment benefit.
The adjudication officer decided that (a) the resettlement grant constituted a payment of compensation on termination of employment and so the claimant could not qualify for benefit during the ineligible period; and (b) there was no due date in the claimants case and so the ineligible period had to be calculated according to the arithmetical formula provided in the regulations, which produced a date of 5 April 1995.
The claimant appealed to a social security appeal tribunal contending that, as the resettlement grant was intended to cover the costs of his having to move out of the parsonage house, it should not prevent him from receiving benefit for living expenses. On 16 May 1995 the tribunal allowed the appeal on the grounds that the claimant had been self employed and so the expression in the regulations termination of employment could not apply in his case. The adjudication officer appealed to a Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the resettlement grant fell within the definition of compensation in regulation 7(6) of the Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit Regulations 1983 i.e. a ... payment made to or for a person in respect of the termination of the employment ...  because:
(a)	if the claimants incumbency had not been terminated by his resignation, the grant would not have been made. It was therefore apt to describe it as having been made in respect of that termination (para. 13);
(b)	the claimants incumbency was an office or vocation and so fell within the definition of employment laid down in section 122 of the Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.  As there was no definition of employment in the regulations, that provided by the Act must apply (para. 14); 
2.	the resettlement grant did not fall within any of the exceptions listed in paragraphs (a) to (f) of regulation 7(6). The fact that it was intended to cover re-location expenses was not a reason to bring it under any of the exceptions (para. 15);
3.	there was no due date as defined in regulation 7(6), in the claimants case. The incumbent of a parish can only be removed from office for certain specified reasons following a formal process laid down in ecclesiastical law and cannot be dismissed on notice in the manner of an employee. Therefore there was no ... period of notice applicable to  the claimant and so there could not be a due date (para. 3);
4.	the ineligible period had to be calculated according to the formula in paragraph (b) of the definition of the standard date in regulation 7(6). In accordance with regulation 7(1)(d) of the regulations, the claimant was not entitled to unemployment benefit for any day during the ineligible period.

On 2 December 1992, the Court of Appeal held in Cottingham and Geary v. Chief Adjudication Officer and Secretary of State for Social Security (reported as R(P) 1/93) that occupational pensions did not qualify as earnings for the purposes of calculating a claimants entitlement to an increase of benefit in respect of a dependant.  On 5 December 1992, legislation reversed that decision.  On 16 March 1993, the claimant claimed an increase of invalidity pension in respect of his wife who was in receipt of an occupational pension which, if treated as earnings, would have had the effect that the increase was not payable.  The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was entitled to the increase only from 2 December 1992 to 4 December 1992, on the basis that the occupational pension prevented payment under the new legislation from 5 December 1992 and that payment before the date of the Court of Appeals decision was precluded by section 68 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.  Section 68 provided that, where a court had found a decision of an adjudication officer to have been erroneous in point of law and a claim in another case would, apart from section 68, have fallen to be determined in accordance with the decision of the court, entitlement in respect of a period before the date of the decision of the court should be determined as thought the court had not found the adjudication officer to have erred in law. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who considered that, as an appellate body, they were not bound by section 68 and awarded the increase from a date before 2 December 1992.  The adjudication officer appealed. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the House of Lords decision in Bate v. Chief Adjudication Officer (reported as R(IS) 12/96) applied to section 68 (claims) as it applied to section 69 (reviews) and therefore, when section 68 restricted the power of an adjudication officer to award benefit, it equally restricted the power of a  tribunal to award benefit on appeal from that adjudication officer;
2.	the Court of Appeal in Cottingham and Geary had indirectly found erroneous in law the adjudication officers decisions refusing benefit in the cases before them and section 68 therefore operated in the present case to prevent the increase of invalidity pension being awarded before the date of the Court of Appeals decision.",1,54,,,

The claimant appealed but, on 29 August 1995, his appeal was dismissed by a tribunal who considered his capacity for work as at the date of the adjudication officers decision and did not deal with his contention that his condition had recently deteriorated.  The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.  A tribunal of Commissioners was appointed to hear the case with appeals on files CIB/14430/1996 and CIS/12015/1996 and to determine whether the tribunal should have taken into account any deterioration in health between the date of the adjudication officers decision and the date of the tribunal hearing.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	R(S) 1/83, in which a tribunal of Commissioners had held that an open-ended claim remained open until any appeal in relation to the claim had been determined so that an appellate body could award benefit for the most recent period before it even if not awarding it at the date of the decision under appeal, remained good law; 
2.	where a decision was made to award benefit for an indefinite period and that decision was reviewed so as to terminate the award, the original decision and the review decision had to be considered as a composite decision so that the original claim had not been finally disposed of until any appeal against the review decision had been determined;
3.	therefore, a tribunal hearing an appeal against such a review decision must consider possible entitlement down to the date of the hearing and they must not refuse to consider contentions or evidence of a deterioration in the claimants health since the date of the review decision;
4.	however, whilst a tribunal do not have a mere discretion to deal with the issue of deterioration but are obliged to rule on the matter, they nevertheless should not do so until they have sufficient evidence and a tribunal may wish to adjourn a hearing in order to exercise their powers to obtain medical or other expert evidence or to require the claimant or his representative to produce such evidence of the alleged deterioration.

The claimant moved from rented accommodation into accommodation owned by her brother.  She claimed housing benefit in respect of the payments she agreed to make to her brother.  Benefit was refused and the claimant appealed to a tribunal.  The tribunal concluded from its findings of fact taken cumulatively that the tenancy was not on a commercial basis and therefore she fell to be treated as not liable to make payments in respect of the dwelling (regulation 7(1)(a) Housing Benefit (General) Regulations).  On appeal to the Commissioner it was argued on behalf of the claimant that the tribunal had failed to explain the basis of its decision, and in particular had not made it clear which of its findings of fact had weighed most heavily in favour of the decision that the arrangement was not on a commercial basis.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	regulation 7 presupposed that there was a genuine legal liability to make payments in respect of the dwelling. Otherwise there was no entitlement by virtue of regulation 6. A case under regulation 7 must be considered on the basis that there was an arrangement that created a legal liability for payment (para. 19);	

2.	the proper approach for an appeal tribunal was to investigate and determine the facts material to the issue and then determine as a question of ""compound fact"" whether as a matter of the proper use of language the arrangement was not on a commercial basis, applying the principles established by the authorities (para. 20-22);	

3.	in applying those principles (summarised by the Commissioner in paragraphs 10-14), the tribunal must not reason by analogy from the reported cases and must consider the individual facts of each case in the context of all the others (para. 22);	

4.	it followed that, if a tribunal had made sufficient findings of the constituent facts, there may be little more that it could usefully say to explain its findings of compound fact (para. 23);

5.	the grounds of appeal in the present case were therefore misconceived, as the tribunal had made sufficient findings of the constituent facts, and had not misdirected itself as to the law (para. 28-29).",1,131,,,

Chiltern District Council and Warden Housing Association,,"Tribunal procedure - jurisdiction over exercise of a local authority's discretion as to the person from whom they will recover an overpayment of housing benefit

Calculation of overpayment -- whether offset should be applied before termination of housing benefit where a ""passport benefit"" ceases

The tenant received housing benefit paid direct to his landlord. The local authority determined that there had been a recoverable overpayment of housing benefit following the termination of his income-based jobseeker's allowance (the ""passport benefit""). They sought to recover the overpayment from the landlord. The landlord appealed to an appeal tribunal and then to the Commissioner, who held inter alia that (1) there was no right of appeal against the exercise of a local authority's discretion as to the person from whom they would recover an overpayment, as it was not a decision under regulation 101 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (""the Regulations"") and (2) before terminating entitlement on cessation of a passport benefit, the authority must, under regulation 104 of the Regulations, consider whether there was continuing entitlement in the changed circumstances.  

The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal on the above issues.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	without regulation 101 there would be no power to choose the person from whom to recover an overpayment, so the exercise of that power of choice must be a decision under that regulation. It was quite clear that the legislation contemplated a right of appeal against the exercise of that power (paras. 14-15);

2.	under regulation 67 of the Regulations the cessation of a passport benefit had the effect of ending the benefit period, whereupon the authority was required by regulation 72(14)(a) to invite a fresh claim. That process was quite separate from determining any offset to the overpayment under regulation 104.  There was no power to postpone the termination of the award while obtaining information in order to apply regulation 104 (paras. 19-21).

The case was remitted to an appeal tribunal for determination.",1,133,133,,

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,,"Failure to attend Jobcentre and provide signed declaration - time at which entitlement is to cease - meaning of ""evidence which shows that he continues to be entitled to a jobseeker's allowance""

The claimant was awarded jobseeker's allowance in March 1999 and was required to sign the standard declaration when he attended the Jobcentre once a fortnight. He duly did so on 18 May but on the next ""signing day"", 1 June, he did not attend because he thought that he had a reasonable prospect of a job away from home. He did not contact the Jobcentre to explain his failure. On 14 June he attended the Jobcentre and was told that his entitlement had ceased. He made a new claim but the adjudication officer decided that this claim could not be backdated for the period 19 May to 13 June. The claimant appealed against this decision but it was confirmed by the appeal tribunal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner. 

The Commissioner assumed that there must have been a decision ending the previous award and held that the appeal should be treated as being against that decision as well as the backdating decision. The claimant accepted that he had no grounds for backdating, so the sole issue became the date from which the termination decision should take effect. The representative of the Secretary of State contended that this should be 19 May because the words in Regulation 26(a) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 ""evidence which shows that he continues to be entitled to a jobseeker's allowance"" should be construed as referring to the signed declaration.

The Commissioner considered that the Secretary of State's interpretation could not be correct because it would have the result that the date determined under paragraph (a) of Regulation 26 would always be earlier than those determined under paragraphs  (b) or (c), so rendering those provisions of no effect. The Commissioner held that the words in Regulation 26(a) should be construed as referring to the claimant's response to any specific requirement to furnish certificates, documents or other evidence made under Regulation 24(5). However he commented that on that basis Regulation 26(a) was probably of no effect to terminate benefit because the regulations provided the Secretary of State with no remedy for a claimant's failure to comply with Regulation 24(5).

Therefore the termination date in the present case fell to be determined under Regulations 26(b) or (c), both of which had the effect that benefit should have ceased on 1 June. The Commissioner set aside the tribunal decision and substituted a decision that the claimant was not entitled to jobseeker's allowance from and including 1 June to 13 June inclusive. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 

Held, allowing  the appeal, that:

1.	The words in Regulation 26(a) ""evidence which shows that he continues to be entitled to jobseeker's allowance"" can reasonably be interpreted as referring to the signed declaration required by Regulation 24(6). The word ""evidence"" is capable of including a declaration, because a declaration is intrinsically evidence of its contents. A declaration is capable of showing that the claimant continues to be entitled to a jobseeker's allowance because the Secretary of State is entitled to accept it on its face (paragraphs 44-45);

2.	It is not correct that, if the above interpretation is applied, the date determined under paragraph (a) of Regulation 26 will always be earlier than that determined under paragraphs (b) or (c). This is because, in a case where a claimant fails to provide a declaration on the day specified under Regulation 24(10), although the failure to attend and/or provide the declaration is not itself excused, the claimant can still provide a declaration belatedly which can be accepted as showing continuing entitlement to jobseeker's allowance up to and including that day. Therefore the above interpretation does not have the effect of rendering paragraphs (b) and (c) of Regulation 26 inoperative or ineffective and so there is no reason why it should not be applied (paragraphs 40-42);

3.	Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Regulation 26 can never both apply to the same fact situation, because a failure to provide a declaration cannot be subsumed within a failure to attend. Paragraph (c) will only apply where the claimant is allowed to provide declarations by post or where the claimant attends on the appropriate day but refuses to provide a declaration. Therefore in any particular fact situation there will only be two dates to consider under Regulation 26, which is why the draftsman used the word ""earlier"" rather than ""earliest"" (paragraphs 48-49);

4.	Where Regulation 26 provides that entitlement shall cease on a particular day, this means that there is no entitlement for that day, because the law takes no account of part of a day. Therefore applying Regulation 26(a) in the present case has the effect that the claimant is not to receive benefit for 19 May 1999 (paragraph 52); 

5.	It is not correct that the Secretary of State has no remedy if the claimant fails to furnish certificates, documents or other evidence required under Regulation 24(5). The appropriate action for the Secretary of State to take is to suspend payment of benefit under Regulation 16 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (paragraph 43); 

The Court made a declaration that the claimant was not entitled to jobseeker's allowance from 19 May to 13 June 1999 inclusive.",1,216,,,

The claimant was refused incapacity benefit by an adjudication officer in 1995 on the ground that he had not satisfied the all work test, because he only achieved 3 points in respect of the bending and kneeling activity. A tribunal ultimately allowed the claimants appeal for part of the period in question, but decided, by a majority, that during the remainder of the period the claimant only scored 6 points, being 3 in respect of rising from sitting and 3 because he sometimes cannot bend or kneel as if to pick up a piece of paper from the floor. The view of the dissenting minority was that the claimant could only pick up a piece of paper from the floor by squatting, so he satisfied the descriptor cannot bend or kneel as if to pick up a piece of paper from the floor and should accordingly be awarded 15 points. The claimant had submitted that squatting was neither bending, that is bending at the waist, nor kneeling, that is placing one or both knees to the floor. All members of the tribunal agreed that the claimant could only achieve that task by squatting. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.  in the context of the descriptors for the activity of bending and kneeling, the words as if to pick up a piece of paper from the floor colour the words bend or kneel;
2. people would normally pick up a piece of paper from the floor by a combination of bending at the waist and bending at the knee;
3. the descriptors therefore encompass bending at the knee, so that a person who only bends at the knee, or squats, does not satisfy the two descriptors concerned.

The claimant applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Held, refusing permission to appeal, that:
1.	the descriptor cannot bend or kneel as if to pick up a piece of paper from the floor is concerned with the disability of a person who is unable to get down to the floor and pick up a piece of paper without assistance;
2.	the claimants only limitation is that he does not, or cannot, bend his back;

Walter [2001] EWCA Civ 1913,,"Discrimination on grounds of sex - absence of leave granted to full time student who was pregnant - whether direct discrimination contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC

The claimant was part way through the third year of a full-time degree course when she applied for leave of absence. She was expected to return to resume her third-year studies at the beginning of a subsequent academic year after her confinement. She applied for jobseeker's allowance, which was refused on the ground that she was a ""full-time student"" according to the definition used in the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996, which meant that she was regarded as not available for employment. A tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal, and she appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner decided that jobseeker's allowance is a single benefit and that the benefit is within the scope of Article 3 of Council Directive 79/7/EEC. The Commissioner further decided that discrimination against a pregnant student is direct discrimination against women in breach of Article 4 of the Directive, that there is such discrimination in the terms of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996, and that no justification for that discrimination has been established. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1. the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 make no express distinction between men and women, nor do they seek to deal with whether a woman is pregnant or not;
2. the claimant's ineligibility for jobseeker's allowance derived from her status as a student, and her leave of absence did not alter the position;
3. European law seeks to protect in general terms the position of pregnant women, but it is an over-simplification to assert that for a pregnant woman to suffer any detriment connected with her condition amounts to discrimination;
4. notwithstanding that the claimant was faced with a harsh decision whether to abandon her course and obtain jobseeker's allowance, or to continue as a student on leave of absence and not obtain it, the Regulations do not deprive a woman of the right to benefit because she is pregnant;
5. the Regulations are not directly discriminatory against pregnant women or against women generally, and are not therefore in breach of Council Directive 79/7/EEC.

[Note: Subsequent to the decision of the Commissioner, the Court of Appeal held, in Hockenjos v. Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 624, that income-based jobseeker's allowance fell within the scope of Council Directive 79/7/EEC.

The claimant was given leave to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor in 1993. His nephew subsequently signed a sponsors undertaking to be responsible for the claimants maintenance and accommodation. The claimant was given indefinite leave to remain in 1994. He left the United Kingdom in 1995. In 1996 the Social Security (Persons From Abroad) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996 implemented a change of Government policy aimed at excluding people covered by sponsorship undertakings from income support. This was achieved by prescibing the applicable amount for persons from abroad as nil for a period of 5 years. Soon after that the claimant returned to the United Kingdom and was given leave to enter as a returning resident. He also left for a short time in 1997, and again returned and was given leave to enter under the same terms. He then made the first of three claims for income support. They were all rejected by an adjudication officer on the basis that the 5-year period had not elapsed, and the claimants appeal to a tribunal was dismissed. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who decided inter alia that leave granted to enter the United Kingdom under paragraph 18 of the Immigration Rules is fresh leave, reflecting the fact that the immigrant has previously been granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. The sponsors undertaking was a continuous one, and it applied to leave granted under paragraph 18. The Commissioner also decided that the amendments made by the 1996 Regulations were authorised by sections 135(1) and (2), and 175(3)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1. this particular undertaking is offered by the sponsor for the benefit of the immigrant and it should be construed in the light of the immigration scheme as a whole;
2. the Commissioner was right to reject a strict approach to construction when deciding that the undertaking was a continuing one, which related to grant of leave on the claimants subsequent return to the United Kingdom;
3. the the use of the word upon an undertaking in regulation 21(3)(i) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 is to be construed so that the leave granted on the claimants return to the United Kingdom was on the basis of the undertaking;
4. section 135(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 specifically permits an applicable amount of nil to be prescribed, so it is not arguable that the use of that enabling power in the Social Security (Persons From Abroad) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996 renders those Regulations ultra vires.",1,242,,,

The claimant, who had been in receipt of income support for many years, was awarded middle rate care component of disability living allowance (DLA) for five years. As a result of that award she was entitled to have a severe disability premium added to her income support. At the end of the five years she made a renewal claim for DLA, which was refused and her appeal against that refusal was dismissed. She did not inform the office administering her income support of the change, and the postal notification system between the two offices failed, so that she continued to receive the premium in her income support for two years. By the time the mistake was discovered a substantial overpayment had arisen. The Secretary of State decided that the overpayment was recoverable under section 71(1) of the Social Security Administration Act as it had arisen in consequence of the claimant's failure to disclose that her DLA had expired. Regulation 32(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 requires claimants to notify the Secretary of State of such information as the Secretary of State may require and any change of circumstances which the claimant might reasonably be expected to know might affect the right to benefit, or to its receipt. The claimant appealed, arguing inter alia that disclosure could not reasonably be expected of her, because of her ill-health and lack of understanding of the benefit system. The tribunal found that she was capable of understanding the instructions issued to claimants and dismissed the appeal.
The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who dismissed the appeal, following the decision of the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(SB) 15/87 reaffirmed by the Tribunal in CG/4494/1999, but gave her leave to appeal, in order to enable her to test the correctness of the decisions of the Tribunals in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, holding that it was reasonable to believe that the relevant information would reach the decision-makers in the income support office and that the Secretary of State must be deemed to have knowledge of decisions taken in his name. The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords.

Held by the House of Lords, allowing the appeal (Lord Scott of Foscote dissenting), that:

1.	Commissioners had consistently held that the legislation imposes the primary duty upon the claimant to inform the relevant decision-maker of the material facts and rejected attempts to introduce a theoretical or constitutional dimension into the question of whether disclosure has been made for the purposes of section 71 (paragraphs 20 and 21);

2.	the Court of Appeal was wrong to reject the principles developed and applied by the Commissioners over a number of years; the Commissioners had practical experience of the day-to-day working of the benefit system, and the principles they had devised to give effect to the legislative scheme dealing with overpayments were entitled to great respect (paragraphs 29 and 30);

3.	the claimant's duty, whether implied by section 71(1) or derived from regulation 32(1), was to disclose to the office administering the benefit in question and she was not concerned or entitled to make assumptions about the internal administrative arrangements of the Department (paragraph 32); 

4.	the cessation of DLA payments was a notifiable change of circumstances, notwithstanding that the instructions to claimants told them to disclose when benefit income went ""up or down"" (paragraph 33).

Liability to make payments in respect of a dwelling - whether tenancy agreement is a sham

The local authority sought to recover an alleged overpayment on the basis that the claimant did not fall within any of the categories of people treated as liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling set out in regulation 6(1) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. On appeal a tribunal accepted that she was liable under regulation 6(1)(a) as the person actually liable to make payments, but went on to consider regulation 7, which lists circumstances in which a person who is liable is to be treated as not liable. The claimant had no warning that regulation 7 was at issue and was therefore unable to make representations on that regulation. The tribunal decided that she was to be treated as not liable under the version of regulation 7 in force at the date of the hearing, 9 January 2002.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	in considering regulation 7 without  warning the claimant the tribunal breached the principles of natural justice and the claimant's Convention right (paragraph 7);	

2.	the tribunal erred in applying the version of regulation 7 that was in force at the date of the hearing. The relevant legislation was that in force in respect of the overpayment period (paragraph 8);

3.	the problems would have been avoided if the local authority had based its decision in the alternative on regulation 6 and regulation 7 (paragraph 9);	

4.	in considering documentary evidence in relation to regulation 6(1)(a) the tribunal must determine first  whether on its face the evidence imposes a liability to pay rent. It is irrelevant to this question why the term was made and how the agreement has been implemented by the parties (paragraphs 12, 13 & 17);	

5.	if the document imposes a liability to pay rent, the tribunal must consider whether that liability is genuine. That is a question of fact and the legal burden of proof is on the local authority. Evidence of the way in which the agreement has been implemented by the parties may be taken into account in determining this question, but should not be given undue significance (paragraphs 14 - 22).

The claimant made a claim for working families' tax credit (WFTC) on 20 September 2000. The amount of WFTC depended on the earnings received by her partner (P) in the three months immediately before the week beginning 17 September 2000 (by virtue of regulation 14(2)(b) of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987). The payslips submitted (for July, August and September) all showed a figure for ""salary"" of £1040.60. However, the payslips for July and August also showed a deduction described as ""overpayment"" of £76, so that the ""gross for tax"" figure was £964.60. The ""overpayment"" deduction resulted from a previous overpayment made to P by his employer in respect of which it had been agreed that recovery of the amount would be in instalments over June, July and August. The decision maker took as the gross pay the figure of £1040.60 for each month, applying thereto the actual deductions for income tax and national insurance in each month. The claimant appealed, arguing that the figure taken should have been that after the deduction of the overpayment and that only £964.60 should have been taken into account for July and August. The tribunal confirmed the decision under appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	regulation 20 of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987 and the meaning therein of ""gross earnings"" must be considered in the context that the general approach in the regulations for employees is to focus on what is actually received by way of earnings in the assessment period, with no further test of whether that represents what is normal (paragraphs 10 and 11);

2.	the most natural analysis of the situation in the present case was that there was a variation of the partner's contract of employment by agreement, so that he was only entitled to receive £964.60 gross in the three months of June, July and August (paragraph 13);

3.	therefore, from that analysis, the remuneration or profit derived from P's employment in July and August, and his gross earnings in each month, was £964.60, such conclusion and analysis being consistent both with the context (described in paragraph 10) of the regulations and their rough and ready approach of taking into account amounts actually received (paragraph 14);

4.	taking into account all the factors (discussed at paragraph 20) surrounding the decision in CCS/4378/2001, that decision should not be followed and the legal position for WFTC purposes is as set out in paragraphs 12 to 15 of this decision (paragraph 21).

The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal and substituted his own decision that the claimant's entitlement to WFTC was to be calculated on the basis that the gross earnings of P in the assessment period were to be taken as, in July 2000 £964.60, in August 2000 £964.60 and in September 2000 £1040.60.",1,106,273,,

Each claimant was employed in a teaching post with fluctuating hours during term-time and no work during school holidays or college vacations.  At the beginning of the holidays or vacations there was an element of uncertainty as to the extent to which he or she would be employed the following term or, it was argued in two of the cases, whether he or she would be employed at all.   They claimed jobseeker's allowance at the beginning of the summer holiday or vacation, but their claims were disallowed by adjudication officers on the ground that they were engaged in remunerative work and their appeals were dismissed by tribunals.  They appealed to the Commissioners.  The same Tribunal of Commissioners had decided in R(JSA) 4/03 that regulation 51(2)(c) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 involved unlawful discrimination against women contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC and should not be applied.  

Held, allowing the appeals in CJSA/2079/1998 and CJSA/4014/1998 but dismissing the appeal in CJSA/426/1999, that:

1.	where a contract of employment came to an end at the beginning of what would have been a period of absence from work even if the contract had continued, the person should be taken still to be in employment if it was expected that he or she would resume employment after that period, either because there was some express arrangement, though not necessarily an enforceable contract, or because it was reasonable to assume that a long standing practice of re-employment would continue (paragraph 22);

2.	the extent to which a person was to be regarded as being on holiday for the purpose of regulation 52(1) of the 1996 Regulations should be determined by reference to his or her contractual entitlement to holiday (paragraph 27);  	

3.	where there was a cycle of one year, as would usually be the case for a term-time worker, the average number of hours of work for both teaching and non-teaching staff should be calculated under regulation 51(2)(b)(i) of the 1996 Regulations by dividing the total number of hours worked during the terms by 52 less the number of weeks of holiday to which the particular claimant was entitled, and the reasoning in R(IS) 15/94 and R(IS) 7/96 should no longer be followed (paragraphs 29 to 31);
	
4.	where a claimant had a cycle of work under one contract, hours worked under additional contracts could either be aggregated so as to be brought into the calculation as fluctuations within the cycle of work established by the first contract or be aggregated only during the periods covered by the additional contracts, but, where the additional contracts were with the same employer and involved the same kind of work as the main contract, and where the additional work was performed during the periods of work within the cycle established by the main contract, the additional hours should be treated as fluctuations in the main contract and aggregated accordingly (paragraphs 40 and 41).

Remunerative work - term-time workers - calculation of hours of work

Each of the claimants was employed in an academic institution for over 16 hours a week during term time.  They claimed jobseeker's allowance during the summer vacation but their claims were disallowed and their appeals were dismissed by tribunals on the ground that they were in remunerative work as they worked for more than 16 hours a week.  The tribunals relied on regulation 51(2)(c) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 which provided that the number of hours for which a person was engaged in work was to be determined, ""where the person works at a school or other educational establishment or at some other place of employment and the cycle of work consists of one year but with school holidays or similar vacations during which he does no work, by disregarding those periods and any other periods in which he is not required to work.""  In Banks v. Chief Adjudication Officer [2001] UKHL 33 (reported as R(IS) 15/01), the House of Lords had held regulation 51(2)(c) to have the effect that the claimant was to be treated as being in remunerative work over the whole cycle of work (including school holidays during which no work duties were performed and in respect of which no wages were paid). The claimants appealed to the Commissioners on the ground that regulation 51(2)(c) gave rise to indirect discrimination on grounds of sex, contrary to Council Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. 
Held, allowing the appeal in CJSA/5732/1999 but dismissing the appeals in CJSA/5836/1999 and CJSA/3444/2000, that:

1.	regulation 51(2)(c) worked to the disadvantage of some of the claimants to whom it applied because they were treated as engaged in remunerative work for the whole year of the cycle of work when they would not be so treated if regulation 51(2)(b)(i) (which applied to all other claimants with cycles of work) were applied to them and, accepting a concession made by the Secretary of State, it operated to the disadvantage of disproportionately more women than men (paragraphs 9 and 12);

2.	justification of that disproportionate effect was not made out by the Secretary of State, who had failed to establish that regulation 51(2)(c) was necessary in pursuit of a legitimate social policy, and regulation 51(2)(c) was therefore inconsistent with Council Directive 79/7/EEC (paragraph 20);

3.	the Directive was to be given effect by regarding regulation 51(2)(c) as having no effect with the consequence that regulation 51(2)(b)(i) applied to the claimants' cases (paragraphs 23 and 24);
On the facts of the cases, the Tribunal of Commissioners held that the claimant in CJSA/5732/1999 was not engaged in remunerative work but that the claimants in CJSA/5836/1999 and CJSA/3444/2000 were engaged in remunerative work.

Tribunals - jurisdiction - whether appealable decision existed

Commissioners - jurisdiction - whether appeal to a Commissioner on a recoupment issue has been removed 

The claimant was a part-time worker in receipt of working families' tax credit. He resigned and brought proceedings for constructive dismissal which led to him being awarded compensation by an employment tribunal.

Following the award of compensation, the Secretary of State served a recoupment notice under the Employment Protection (Recoupment of Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support) Regulations 1996. The claimant's solicitor responded by challenging the failure to deduct the amount of working families' tax credit which he would have received had he not been dismissed. His letter was treated as an appeal against the recoupment notice. No further decision was made by the Secretary of State and the appeal was heard by a tribunal, which upheld the terms of the recoupment notice. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	there is no power for the Secretary of State to take account of benefits which would have been paid but for the claimant's dismissal, so as to reduce the amount of jobseeker's allowance which is recouped;

2.	as no decision had been taken pursuant to regulation 10(2) of the 1996 regulations, a decision had not been made under section 8 and the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal;

3.	the absence of a specific reference in the 1996 regulations to the right of appeal to a Commissioner from a tribunal decision did not remove a Commissioner's jurisdiction to hear appeals on recoupment questions.
Although the tribunal decision was of no effect, no further action was needed to deal with the case as the recoupment notice had been correct.",1,216,60,,

Standing - ability to stand with palms of hands on table

The claimant suffered from low back pain and sciatica. He told the tribunal he could lift a 5lb bag of potatoes from a supermarket shelf to a trolley. The tribunal concluded that he had no problem with lifting and carrying. On appeal to the Commissioner, it was argued that ""carry"" connoted a degree of movement from one place to another. It was also argued that the tribunal had applied the wrong test in relation to the activity of standing, in that they took into account the claimant's ability to stand for 40 minutes without apparent discomfort during the hearing with both palms on the table, without indicating that they had considered the support that placing his palms on the table might have provided for his back.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	It was clear that, since the amendment to the definition of the activity of lifting and carrying in paragraph 8 of the Schedule to the Social Security (Incapacity for Work)(General) Regulations 1995 as from 6 January 1997, the descriptors which refer to the claimant's ability to ""pick up and carry"" an object do not require him to be able to do more than move the object by means of his upper body and arms, and in particular do not require him to be able to walk with it (paragraph 8);	

2.	The facility of placing both palms on the table while standing could have provided support for the claimant's back above and beyond the only support (i.e. that of a walking stick) contemplated by the statutory definition of the activity of standing. The Tribunal should have indicated that it appreciated that and had taken it into account  (paragraph 11).

The claimant was in receipt of a category A retirement pension based on her own national insurance contributions and earnings factors. The pension consisted of a basic pension and an additional (earnings related) pension, but was, under the provisions of section 46 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, subject to a deduction in respect of a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) derived  from an occupational pension scheme. On the death of her husband she became entitled to a category B retirement pension calculated by reference to his national insurance contributions and earnings factors, also subject to a deduction in respect of her GMP. By virtue of section 52 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (""the Benefits Act""), she was also entitled to have her Category A pension increased by reference to the category B retirement pension. As the category A pension was the higher amount, the effect of section 43 of the Benefits Act was that she was entitled to receive only the category A pension. The issue was whether the deduction in respect of the GMP should be made at the end of the calculation or, as the claimant contended, at the stage of calculating the additional pension attributable to the claimant's own earnings.  The latter led to a more favourable result, because the maximum (the ""cap"") imposed by section 52(3) of the Benefits Act on the amount of additional pension was not reached. The tribunal in effect accepted the claimant's contention.  The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the very strong impression created by the language of section 46 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 was that the GMP was to be deducted after the appropriate pension  had been worked out and not at some intermediate stage in working it out (para. 8(1));	

2.	the claimant's contention involved reading the references to ""additional pension"" in section 52(3) of the Benefits Act as referring to the amount after the section 46 deduction. That assumed that the deduction should be treated as made only from the additional pension element, but section 46 provided simply for the deduction to be made from the total pension. Also, if that reading were applied to section  52(3)(b, it would have the effect that the GMP would be deducted twice (para. 8(2)); 	

3.	the Secretary of State's contention would lead to the entitlement being the same whether or not the claimant had been in a contracted out scheme, whereas the claimant's contention would  lead to the anomaly that she would be entitled to a higher pension as a result of having been in a contracted out scheme (para. 8(3));	

4.	the anomalies said by the claimant to arise from the Secretary of State's contention were not in reality anomalies at all, but either inevitable consequences of the cap in section 52(3) or a consequence of overlooking the claimant's GMP entitlement (para. 8(4)).",1,262,,,

The claimant was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  He was informed by the Jobcentre that he was to be enrolled on a ""Jobplan Workshop"" provided by a private company. He wrote to the Jobcentre manager objecting to his personal details being passed to a private company. Nevertheless he was required to attend the course and when he refused a decision was made that he had not shown good cause for his refusal under regulation 73 of the Jobseeker's Regulations 1996. A two week disqualification was imposed as prescribed by regulation 69 of those Regulations. He appealed to a tribunal, who dismissed his appeal. His appeal against that decision was allowed by a Commissioner on the grounds that the tribunal had wrongly limited ""good cause"" to the grounds specified in regulation 73(2)(a) to (j). At a re-hearing a new tribunal found simply that the claimant's objection was unreasonable and dismissed the appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal had failed to address the two separate questions relevant to good cause under regulation 73, which were firstly whether the relevant act or omission was attributable to any of the circumstances specifically mentioned in sub-regulations (a) to (j) and, if not, secondly whether it was attributable to any other circumstance which could be regarded as good cause (paragraph 13);

2.	attendance at the course would not have required the claimant personally to act in a way which was contrary to his ethical or moral principles, and so, applying the principles established by unemployment benefit cases, his objection was not a conscientious objection under regulation 73(2)(b) (paragraphs 14-17);

3.	there might be rare cases where ""good cause"" could result from a state of mind other than a conscientious objection, but the state of mind must exist independently of the refusal as a fact preventing attendance (paragraph 18);

4.	the claimant could not escape sanctions because of any failure by the training provider to comply with the Data Protection Act, since the sanction was imposed under section 19(5)(b)(ii) of the Jobseeker's Act 1995 which, unlike section 19(5)(a), did not provide that the requirement should be reasonable (paragraph 19);

5.	the claimant had not established good cause for refusing to attend the Jobplan workshop and the two week period of disqualification was confirmed (paragraph 20).",1,216,,,

The claimant received compensation in 2001 in respect of respiratory disease suffered by her husband, who died in 1988. She transferred the capital to a trust fund. The Secretary of State decided that the trust assets could not be disregarded under paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, because they were not derived from a payment made in consequence of personal injury to the claimant. The tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State's decision.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	even if the effect of regulation 23(1) of the 1987 Regulations was that the reference to ""claimant"" in paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 should be read as including a reference to the claimant's partner (which the Commissioner doubted), he had ceased to be her partner on his death (paragraphs 7-11);	

2.	the argument based on the contention that the husband's personal injury claim had become that of the claimant on his death was fallacious, because the issue under paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 was not who was beneficially entitled to the cause of action, but who suffered the personal injury (paragraph 12);	

3.	the fact that the notional capital provisions in regulation 51(1) and (2) contained exceptions for a trust fund derived from compensation for personal injury, but without specifying that the injury should be to the claimant, could not result in paragraph 12 of Schedule 10, which was concerned with a different question, having a meaning other than that which it plainly had (paragraphs 13-15);	

4.	 there was no doubt that the value of a beneficial interest under a bare trust fell to be taken into account as actual capital under regulation 46(1) of the 1987 Regulations, so that there was no need for the Secretary of State to rely upon regulation 51(1) and (2), and the exceptions to those provisions therefore did not come into play (paragraph 16).",1,21,,,

Each claim was refused by a decision maker on the basis of advice from a specialist medical adviser that the claimant did not did not have the prescribed disease. On appeal the tribunal in each case found that the reference to ""coal worker's pneumoconiosis"" in the post mortem report did not cover the statutory definition, and in the one case where there was a histology report they did not interpret a reference to ""scarring"" in the lungs as a reference to fibrosis.  The appointees' appeals to the Commissioners were heard together at an oral hearing where two medical experts gave evidence.

Held, allowing the appeals in CI/1819/2001, CI/2314/2001 and CI/5130/2001, that:

1.	the diagnosis of PD D1 does not depend on the use of a particular terminology, but is a question of substance whether or not the medical evidence shows that the statutory definition is satisfied (para. 16);	

2.	the term ""dust-reticulation "" is no longer used and is unlikely to be of practical significance in pneumoconiosis cases (para. 17);	

3.	it is safe for tribunals to regard the terms ""scarring"" and ""fibrosis"" as synonymous although the cause must still be determined (para. 18);	

4.	tribunals cannot rely on ""coal worker's pneumoconiosis"" in post mortem reports and death certificates as conclusive that the statutory definition is satisfied (para. 19);	

5.	it is good practice for tribunals to enquire about any histology report that may have been made after a post mortem, and in  some cases a tribunal may go wrong in law  by not obtaining the report (para. 20);

The appellant was appointed by the Secretary of State to act on behalf of her daughter who was a claimant of income support. From May 1997 until she died in April 2000, the claimant lived in a nursing home. Whilst there she had received disability living allowance and incapacity benefit as well as income support, such benefits being paid by direct credit transfer into the claimant's bank account over which the appellant had power of attorney. On 7 April 1999 the relevant county council informed the incapacity benefit section of the Department that a health authority had taken over responsibility for the claimant's nursing home fees from 8 October 1998. On 12 April 1999 the adjudication officer reviewed the award of income support and revised it with effect from 6 October 1998 on the basis that the claimant had ceased to be entitled to income support, once her nursing home fees were fully funded by the health authority, because her incapacity benefit exceeded her applicable amount. In June 2000 two separate overpayment decisions were made with respect to the appointee. The first related to the period from 6 October 1998 to 5 April 1999, by virtue of which recovery was sought under section 71(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 on the basis that on 8 October 1998 or as soon as possible thereafter the appointee on behalf of the claimant failed to disclose the material fact that the health authority were funding the claimant's stay in the nursing home. The second related to the period from 6 April 1999 to 12 April 1999 and sought recovery under regulation 11 of the Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988 on the basis that overpayment in that week had been caused by direct credit transfer arrangements. The appointee appealed, arguing that the overpayment was not recoverable because she could not reasonably have been expected to tell the Department about the change of funding and, relying on CIS/332/1993, that, in any event, a failure to disclose or a misrepresentation by an appointee grounded recovery against the claimant alone and not against the appointee unless the latter was acting in a personal capacity rather than in the capacity as appointee. The tribunal dismissed her appeal, preferring R(IS) 5/00 to CIS/332/1993. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Chief Commissioner directed that the appeal be determined by a Tribunal of Commissioners

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:

1.	the tribunal's decision was erroneous in point of law because, applying R(SB) 21/82, unless disclosure by the appellant was reasonably to be expected, there was no failure to disclose on her part and the tribunal had not considered whether the appellant could reasonably have been expected to know that the new source of funding was, or might be, a material fact that she ought to disclose (paragraph 39);

2.	on the evidence, the appellant could not have been expected to realise until 1 December 1998 that the change of the source of funding was, or might be, a material fact that she ought to disclose and, accordingly, the overpayment before then was not recoverable from her (paragraph 45);

3.	where an appointee had obtained a social security benefit by misrepresenting or failing to disclose a material fact, the Secretary of State might generally recover the overpaid benefit from both the appointee and the claimant, but, where the appointee had retained the benefit instead of paying it to, or applying it for the benefit of, the claimant, only the appointee was liable and, where the appointee had acted with due care and diligence, only the claimant was liable (paragraph 63);

4.	from the finding that disclosure by the appellant of the change of source of the funding was reasonably to be expected, it followed that she had not used due care and diligence and, accordingly, the resulting overpayment from 1 December 1998 to 5 April 1999 was recoverable from her under section 71(1) and (3) of the 1992 Act (paragraph 69);

5.	an overpayment might be recovered from an appointee under regulation 11 of the 1988 Regulations only to the extent that the appointee had not paid the money to the claimant or applied it for the claimant's benefit and, otherwise, was recoverable only from the claimant who had had the benefit of the money so that, in this case, the overpayment from 6 April 1999 to 12 April 1999 was not recoverable from the appellant because the benefit had been paid straight to her daughter (paragraphs 73 and 74);

6.	in every case where there is an appointee, the Secretary of State should, when the overpayment is discovered, issue a recoverability decision that deals with the liability of both the appointee and the claimant (paragraph 67)",1,230,,,

The claimant was a Polish national who came to the United Kingdom in 1998 and claimed asylum. He was granted temporary admission by the immigration authorities. He claimed income support and was awarded it under the rules in force at the time. In July 2000 his claim for income support was refused under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) and Social Security (Immigration and Asylum) Consequential Amendments Regulations 2000 (the 2000 Regulations), in force from April 2000. Those provisions excluded from entitlement to income support persons subject to immigration control, subject to certain exceptions. The claimant contended that he fell within the exception in paragraph 4 of the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, namely that he was a national of a state that had ratified the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance and was lawfully present in the United Kingdom. The issue at each stage of his appeal was the meaning of “lawfully present”. The appeal tribunal allowed his appeal, holding that he was lawfully present because he was present with the knowledge and permission of the immigration authorities. The Commissioner allowed the Secretary of State’s appeal, accepting that he was bound by Kaya v Haringey London Borough Council [2001] EWCA Civ 677, [2002] HLR 1 and agreeing with that judgment in holding that a grant of temporary admission did not confer “lawful presence” because (a) section 11(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 deems a person “who has not otherwise entered the United Kingdom … not to do so as long as he is … temporarily admitted” and (b) temporary admission was merely a mechanism to prevent illegality and  “lawfully present” required more than simply the absence of illegality. The Court of Appeal upheld the Commissioner’s decision, regarding itself also as bound by Kaya, which a majority also held to be correct.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	whilst the decision in Kaya was correct, the reasoning was wrong: section 11’s purpose was not to safeguard the person admitted from prosecution for unlawful entry but rather to exclude him from the rights given to those granted leave to enter. Even assuming that section 11’s deemed non-entry would otherwise be capable of affecting the construction of the 1999 Act and the 2000 Regulations, it would be wrong to carry the fiction beyond its originally intended purpose so as to deem a person in fact lawfully here not to be here at all (paragraph 25);
2.	there was no possible reason why paragraph 4 should be construed as requiring more by way of positive legal authorisation for someone’s presence in the United Kingdom than that they are at large here pursuant to the express written authority of an immigration officer provided for by statute (paragraph 28).

The claimant had suffered an amputation of the index and middle fingers of his right hand at their base and his right ring finger was held in a fixed flexion deformity. The adjudication officer awarded the claimant twelve points for impairment of manual dexterity and of lifting and carrying under descriptors 7(f) and 8(e). The tribunal considered that the claimant's difficulties could be included only within the scope of the activity of manual dexterity. The tribunal took the view that the wording of activity 8 (""lifting and carrying by the use of the upper body and arms (excluding all other activities specified in Part 1 of this Schedule)"" precluded the award of any points for lifting and carrying. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The adjudication officer supported the appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the wording of activity 8 had been amended by the Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996. The effect of the amendment had been to preclude from taking into consideration those activities which are often associated with lifting and carrying but which are separate components of one continuous manoeuvre (e.g. walking, reaching and bending, walking up and down stairs and standing and rising from sitting). (CSIB/42/1996 and CSIB/13/1996 distinguished);

2.	on a literal interpretation of the exclusion in activity 8, any problem with the use of hands was to be excluded but this would negate a very significant aspect of what was included in the concept of lifting and carrying. Since all the descriptors in activity 8 which attract points referred to the use of a hand in picking up and carrying, it was possible that no award of points under that activity could ever be made in cases where the claimant had a problem with manual dexterity. However, the use of hands is an integral part of the activity of lifting and carrying and not a separate component of it, and adopting a purposive interpretation, the activities and the descriptors had to be read together in order for the all work test to be properly applied.",1,156,,,

Human rights - application of Human Rights Act 1998 where Secretary of State's decision before October 2000 and tribunal hearing afterwards
The mother and father of child ""G"" were married to one another but later divorced, with the mother becoming the parent with care. The father remarried and lived with his second wife, their children and his stepdaughter ""M"" (the child of his second wife). One or both of the father and his second wife were in receipt of working families' tax credit and until September 2000 there was a child support maintenance order in force against M's natural father. In March 2000 the Secretary of State superseded an existing assessment against the father in respect of G. The father appealed, arguing that  he was the parent with care in respect of M, and, as he was in receipt of working families tax credit, it therefore followed that under regulation 10A(1) and (2) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations he should be taken to have an assessable income of nil. On 11 December 200 the tribunal dismissed his appeal. The father appealed to the Commissioner, before whom he also argued that there was a breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. It was contended that the child support scheme had operated in his case to interfere with the right to respect for the family life of his new family and the scheme discriminated in the way that it dealt with a family which included a stepchild as opposed to a natural or adopted child.",1,43,144,,

The claimant, a British citizen, came to the United Kingdom for the first time on 16 September 1998. She claimed income support on 5 October 1998 which was refused on the basis that by 12 October 1998, the date of the decision, she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom under regulation 21(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. She was to be treated as a ""person from abroad"" whose entitlement was nil. The Commissioner applied the reasoning in Nessa v Chief Adjudication Officer [1999] 1WLR 1937 now reported as R(IS)2/00 and decided that the tribunal had not erred in law by finding that the claimant had not become habitually resident four weeks after her arrival in the United Kingdom. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was agreed that in purely domestic law terms, Nessa necessarily concluded the case. However, it was contended that as words in a statute could only have one meaning which could not change according to the facts of the case, the Community meaning (Swaddling v Adjudication Officer [1999] ECR I-1075 now reported as  R(IS)6/99), which excluded a waiting period as a requirement of habitual residence, must be applied to every case to which it was sought to apply regulation 21(3). 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	 (per Buxton LJ) Community law applies only to cases falling within the Community legal order. In deciding an issue concerning a situation which lies outside the scope of Community law, there is no Community law obligation on national courts to interpret a domestic legal provision in a way that conforms to Community law or to disapply that legislation (ICI v Colmer [1998] ECR I-4695);
2.	(per Buxton LJ) there is no rule of Community law determining the meaning of, as opposed to the relevant criteria for adjudicating upon, habitual residence. The European Court of Justice in Swaddling proceeded by identifying the criteria of what a court had to apply when determining whether a particular case was one of habitual residence. There is therefore no meaning that has necessarily to be transposed into domestic law just because the latter uses the words ""habitual residence"";
3.	(per Buxton LJ) there is no legal or logical reason why the criteria used should be the same for adjudicating upon the case of a Community migrant worker and a person coming into the United Kingdom from a third country. The Community case has to be determined in the light of Community principles of freedom of movement and of establishment, considerations that do not apply in the case of a third country; 
4.	this is not a case where the Community definition binds the national courts (distinguishing Massam Dzodi v Belgian State [1990] ECR I-3763 and Leur Bloem v Belastingdienst [1998] QB 182: in the latter case, the domestic concept of  ""merger by the exchange of shares"" was deliberately made the same as the Community concept in Directive 90/434/EEC in the interests of internal harmonisation). There was no intention by using the concept of habitual residence for Regulation 21(3) to create a unified system which applied to both Community and domestic cases. Regulation 1408/71 was not intended to alter or amend the internal social security systems of member states but provided only for arrangements to protect migrant workers.
5.	(per Arden LJ)  domestic law does not require the ""spillover"" issue to be decided in the appellant's favour (Imperial Chemical v Colmer (no 2) [1999] 1 WLR 2035 and Equal Opportunities Commission v Secretary of State for Employment [1995] 1 AC 1 considered).",1,240,126,,

The claimant was made redundant on 2 May 1999 and claimed jobseeker's allowance from the following day. His redundancy package included a compensation payment which was calculated as a monthly entitlement for a maximum period of twenty months. Such ""drip feed"" payments were liable to cessation or reduction in the event of re-employment. It was accepted that the payments were part of a contractual arrangement: they were neither connected in any material way to the employer's pension scheme, nor were they paid out of its funds. The first three payments were payable in advance and were paid with the claimant's final pay on his departure, whilst the regularly monthly payments commenced in the fourth month thereafter. The question before the tribunal was whether such payments fell to be taken into account under regulation 81 of the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996. This in turn depended on whether the payments fell within the definition of ""pension payments"" contained in section 35(1) of the Jobseekers Act 1995, which incorporates the definition of occupational pension scheme provided in section 1 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. Such definition refers, inter alia, to "" .... any scheme or arrangement ... to provide benefits, in the form of pensions or otherwise, payable on termination of service, ... or retirement, to or in respect of earners with qualifying service ..."". The tribunal found that the ""drip feed""payments were ""pension payments"" for the purposes of jobseeker's allowance. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, before whom he argued that the ""drip feed"" payments did not fall within section 1. They were plainly not ""in the form of pensions"", nor did they fall within any proper meaning of ""or otherwise"". The claimant argued further that the tribunal had erred in finding the first three months payments to be a ""periodical payment"" at all because they had been paid together in one lump sum in advance.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	as explained in CJSA 5381/97 [now reported as R(JSA) 1/01], Westminster City Council v Haywood [1998] Ch 377 and City and County of Swansea v Johnson [1999] Ch 189 a periodical payment made following termination of employment is not prevented from being within the definition of ""pension payment"" either by being payable only under a redundancy compensation scheme entirely separate from any pension scheme, or by being payable only under a contractual arrangement from the employer's own resources rather than out of a separate fund;
2.	the facts in the present case showed that the ""drip feed"" arrangement was sufficiently defined to count as a ""scheme or arrangement"" within the first part of the Pension Schemes Act definition, furthermore, given that the payment arose by reason of, and was calculated according to, the employee's service, the last part of the definition was also satisfied;
3.	regarding the first three months payment, the terms of the contractual agreement made it clear that the entitlement was monthly: that was sufficient to bring the whole of the drip feed payments into account as periodical payments notwithstanding that the first three of them were paid together in advance.",1,112,,,

The absent parent and the parent with care purchased the matrimonial home with the assistance of a building society mortgage. That property was later sold leaving a negative equity of £10,000 which the couple continued to repay under a scheme arranged by the building society in June 1992. In August 1992 the couple separated. Subsequently in August 1996 the absent parent arranged with the building society to pay £5000 in full and final settlement of the outstanding debt by way of a personal loan. In due course the absent parent applied for a departure direction in respect of contact costs and his liability under the personal loan. His application was application was refused and the tribunal dismissed his appeal .The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the personal loan replaced the original mortgage debt and that the mortgage debt was clearly a debt incurred before the absent parent had become an absent parent.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	following consideration of CCS/1645/1999, that where repayments were payable under a loan or mortgage in respect of a property which had been in the past, but was no longer, the home of the parent with care and any child in respect of whom the current assessment was made, then the payments did not fall within the exception in regulation 16(2)(h) and the payments did not constitute special expenses;

2.	it is important when considering regulation 16(2) and (4) to consider the situation as at the date of the absent parent's application.

The claimant had a transitional award of long-term incapacity benefit including an increase for his spouse. The increase was subject to regulation 10 of the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit - Increase for Dependants) Regulations 1994 (i.e. the earnings rule). The effect of regulation 10(2) was that the increase was not payable for any benefit week immediately following any benefit week in which a spouse had earnings, as from April 1998 of £50.35, and as from April 1999 of £51.40. In December 1998 the spouse began work in a launderette owned by a family friend. She usually worked for 24 hours a week and the arrangement was that she was paid £25 per week, irrespective of the actual hours worked (which were sometimes more or less than the usual 24). The launderette owner stated that he could not afford to pay the minimum wage hourly rate. 

In November 1999, following the receipt of information that the claimant's wife was working, a decision superseding the claimant's award of benefit was issued. The decision was that the increase for his spouse was not payable, and that the claimant had ceased to be entitled to that increase, from 11 April 1999. The decision was explicitly based on the fact that the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 came into operation on 1 April 1999 and that from that date the hourly rate of the national minimum wage had to be applied under regulation 4(2) of the Social Security (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996 (even though the launderette owner could not afford to pay that rate). A recoverable overpayment was also said to have arisen. Regulation 4(2) of the Computation of Earnings Regulations provides that: ""Where (a) a claimant performs a service for another person; and (b) that person makes no payment of earnings or earns less than that paid for comparable employment in the area, the adjudicating authority shall treat the claimant as possessing such earnings (if any) as is reasonable for that employment unless the claimant satisfies the adjudicating authority that the means of that person are insufficient for him to pay or to pay more for that service; ... ""

The claimant appealed. Following an adjourned hearing the Secretary of State revised the November decision for error of law. The revised decision changed the date of non-payability and loss of entitlement to 14 January 1999, that decision being grounded on the fact that the claimant had not shown that the launderette owner did not have the means to pay the claimant's wife more that £25 per week. It was said that it was reasonable to use the statutory minimum hourly rate in calculating a rate for comparable employment prior to 1 April 1999, unless there was evidence that a higher rate was payable. The overpayment decision was also revised, producing a higher figure for the recoverable overpayment. The claimant's appeal was treated as continuing against the decision as revised and in August 2001 a tribunal dismissed it.

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who directed the Secretary of State to identify the provision said to authorise the making of regulation 4(2). The Secretary of State referred to CG/1768/2000, which decided that regulation 6(2)(a) of the Computation of Earnings regulations was authorised by section 3(2)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. In that case, the Commissioner found that the enabling power in section 3(2)(b) had a similar scope to that contained in section 136(5) of the Act, the latter power having been considered in Owen v. Chief Adjudication Officer (R(IS) 8/99). In the present case, the Secretary of State submitted that if section 3(2)(b) had a similar scope to section 136(5), then it plainly authorised the making of regulation 4(2). The Commissioner held an oral hearing.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	neither Commissioner's decision CG/1768/2000 nor the Court of Appeal's decision in Owen v. Chief Adjudication Officer (R(IS) 8/99) contains any binding ruling that regulation 4(2) of the Computation of Earnings regulations is authorised by section 3(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (para. 15); 

2.	section 3(2) of the 1992 Act authorises the making of regulations which correspond either to the arithmetical process of calculating actual figures or to the estimation of true values (para. 16); 

3.	however, the process in play in regulation 4(2) is neither one of estimation nor calculation of true earnings, it being a condition of its application that the person actually receives no or a restricted amount of earnings in return for providing services: regulation 4(2), if all its conditions are met, deems the person to have notional earnings in addition to what have already been found to be the actual earnings (para. 17);

4.	having regard to the precise wording of paragraphs (a) and (b), the words of the former are directed to calculating or estimating actual earnings, while those of the latter give no power to make regulations which treat a person as having earnings they do not have (para. 20);

5.	regulation 4(2) is therefore ultra vires section 3(2) of the 1992 Act (para.21);

6.	section 17 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 gives workers a contractual entitlement to be paid the national minimum wage rate. Previous Commissioners' decisions suggested that for the purposes of the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1978 earnings were what the person in question was entitled to receive, not what he actually received. However, the general structure of the provisions for employed earners in the 1996 Computation of Earnings Regulations establishes a context which shows that what are to be taken into account are payments actually received, not entitlements which have not resulted in payments - and that context is sufficient to displace the general principle stated in paragraph 8 of the Tribunal of Commissioners' decision R(S) 6/86 (paras. 26, 27 and 32);

7.	accordingly, in the present case, the earnings of the claimant's wife to be taken into account under the 1996 regulations, disregarding regulation 4(2), are the payments she actually received from the owner of the launderette with the result that, although there was a relevant change of circumstances when the wife started work (justifying the making of a superseding decision) the superseding decision should not change the previous decision - i.e. the increase remains payable from and including 28 December 1998 (the relevant date) (paras. 34 and 35). The Commissioner found that the tribunal had erred in point of law by applying regulation 4(2) and set its decision aside. The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the claimant's entitlement to an increase for his wife must be given effect for the period from 25 November 1999, that no overpayment was made in the period from 14 January 1999 to 24 November 1999 and that therefore no question of recoverability arose.",1,109,106,,

The claimant sued her employers in respect of an accident at work. The compensator made a net payment into court after deducting under section 8 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 (""the Act""), the amount specified in the certificate of recoverable benefits issued under the Act. The claimant accepted the net payment in. The claimant subsequently asked for a review of the certificate on the grounds that if the accident had not happened psychological problems would have prevented her from working after age 60 but she would not have experienced any significant back pain before age 65, with the consequence that her claim for damages had not included loss of earnings after age 60 or loss of mobility. The Secretary of State confirmed the certificate. The compensator then appealed on alternative grounds either that the claimant's condition was largely constitutional or, adopting the claimant's own ground of review, that as she would have been unable to work after age 60, benefits paid after her 60th birthday were not recoverable. The tribunal allowed the appeal finding that benefit paid since the claimant's 60th birthday, was not paid in respect of injuries sustained in the accident. The Secretary of State appealed on the ground of the inadequacy of the tribunal's reasons for their finding.

1.	as no appeal lay to a tribunal against a deduction under section 8 of the Act, any dispute as to the entitlement of a compensator to make such a deduction was to be determined by the court seized of the compensation proceedings and accordingly the claimant's remedy had been to refuse to accept the payment in unless the deduction was reduced (paragraph 5);

2.	 if a compensator made a deduction under section 8 of the Act, that implied an acceptance that the benefits were paid in consequence of the relevant accident and it was inconsistent then to argue that they were not (paragraph 10);

3.	regulation 11 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997 No. 2205) provided for adjustments to be made between the parties where a review of or an appeal against a certificate of recoverable benefits resulted in the certificate being revoked and/or replaced with a fresh certificate which had the consequence that a compensator had no interest in appealing against a certificate where the whole of the amount of the certificate had been deducted under section 8 from compensation due to the claimant (paragraph 11);

4.	the tribunal's decision was erroneous in point of law because the reasons given for their decision were not supported by evidence, being based on a misunderstanding of the claimant's grounds for applying for the review (paragraph 14);

5.	a tribunal hearing an appeal under the Act should generally have regard to the basis on which a case is settled by parties acting with the benefit of legal advice and should be slow to accept an argument advanced by a compensator that is inconsistent with a section 8 deduction unless it is supported by the claimant who is the only person who actually has any interest in it or an argument advanced by a claimant that is inconsistent with the basis on which compensation was obtained or upon which benefits were claimed (paragraph 16).

The Commissioner substituted his own decision confirming the original certificate of recoverable benefits",1,73,,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support as a lone parent. In September 1994 she began a BA course and in December 1994 received the first instalment of a grant. She did not inform the income support office of the grant income. As the grant fell to be taken into account as income in the calculation of her income support, there was an overpayment of benefit. The Benefits Agency investigated the overpayment in January 1996, by which time she had abandoned the course, but no action was taken on the information obtained until October 2000, when a decision maker superseded the decision awarding benefit prior to September 1994 and decided that there had been a recoverable overpayment from September 1994 to September 1995. On appeal a tribunal confirmed the decision. In her appeal to the Commissioner the claimant argued that, because of the Secretary of State's delay, there had been a breach of her right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:

1.	the imposition of a liability to repay overpaid benefit was not a penalty by way of punishment, and accordingly did not attract the protections afforded by Article 6(3) to persons charged with criminal offences (paragraphs 13-18);

2.	the claimant was entitled under Article 6(1) to a fair hearing within a reasonable time, but the time to be considered started with the supersession decision in October 2000, which was the first legal step in the process of recovery of the overpayment, and there was no unreasonable delay between that date and the hearing of her appeal in May 2001 (paragraphs 19-22);

3.	on the facts the claimant was not significantly disadvantaged in pursuing her case by the lapse of time, and so there was no breach of the principles of natural justice or equality of arms. Even if there had been such a breach, there was no proportionate remedy within the power of a tribunal or Commissioner (paragraphs 23 and 24);

4.	there was no breach of Article 1 of Protocol 1 as no legitimate expectation that repayment would not be required had been created (paragraph 25);

5.	the tribunal had erred in failing to investigate the facts and adjust the period of the recoverable overpayment accordingly (paragraphs 27-35).

The claimant was separated from his wife. At the time of his claim for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) his two children resided with him for roughly half the week, but the mother was in receipt of child benefit in respect of both children. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was entitled to income-based JSA, but that the amount payable should not include any additional amount in respect of the children, because he was not in receipt of child benefit and was therefore not to be treated as responsible for them by the definition in regulation 77(1) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, which upheld the adjudication officer's decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that the statutory provisions linking increases in respect of children to receipt of child benefit favoured mothers over fathers and therefore contravened the anti-discrimination conditions in Directive 79/7/EEC. The Commissioner, relying on Jackson and another v Chief Adjudication Officer (Case C-63/91) [1992] ECR I-4737, R(IS) 10/91, concluded that income-based JSA did not fall within Article 3 of the Directive as providing protection against the risk of unemployment, but was analogous to income support. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, before whom the main issue was whether the statutory scheme for that allowance provided protection against the risk of unemployment. There was also a dispute as to whether the way the additional amount of income-based JSA was awarded was prohibited by Article 4 of the Directive as being discriminatory.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

It is clear from the long title, section 1 and other sections of the Jobseekers Act 1995 that contributory and income-based JSA form part of a comprehensive statutory scheme which provides protection against the risk of unemployment, and therefore both fall within Article 3 of Directive 79/7/EEC (paragraph 31).
The Court remitted the case to the Commissioner to consider the issue of discrimination. (See R(JSA) 2/05.)",1,117,121,,

Human Rights - whether a tribunal or Commissioner had to apply Article 6 of the Convention even where the decision under appeal was made prior the commencement of the Human Rights Act 1998

The claimant appealed to a tribunal the question of whether he had submitted a properly completed form, so as to have validly claimed income support from 31 January 2001. The tribunal decided that a form which complied with the prescribed requirements for a claim had not been submitted until 17 April 2001, which was therefore the date of claim. The Secretary of State did not at that stage dispute the tribunal's jurisdiction to decide the question.

Upon the claimant appealing to the Commissioner, the Secretary of State submitted that the claimant had, in any case, no right of appeal to a tribunal on a question as to whether a claim had been validly made in accordance with the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, nor as to the date of any such claim. These were decisions against which no appeal lay pursuant to regulation 27 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. The claimant contended, in reply, that those regulations were either ultra vires or contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 2 October 2000.

Held, allowing the appeal and remitting the case for further findings on whether there had been a material non-compliance with the rules for making a claim, that:  

1.	Prior to the coming into force of the Social Security Act 1998, decisions as to whether and when a claim was validly made in compliance with prescribed requirements were taken by adjudication officers, with a right of appeal to a tribunal, and this was unaffected by the amended requirements for making income support and jobseeker's allowance claims, introduced on 6 October 1997 (paragraphs 8-10);
	
2.	following the coming into force of the Social Security Act 1998, such decisions were taken by the Secretary of State and carried rights of appeal to a tribunal pursuant to section 12(1)(a) of that Act, unless validly excluded by regulation 27 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (paragraphs 11-22);	

3.	those regulations were not ultra vires the enabling powers in the Social Security Act 1998 at the time they were made (paragraphs 23-29);	

4.	they were, however, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention and of no applicable effect from 2.10.00, insofar as they purported to exclude rights of appeal against decisions as to whether and when a claim was validly made in compliance with prescribed requirements, where those rights existed prior to the Social Security Act 1998 and would now otherwise arise under section 12 of that Act (paragraphs 39-48);	

5.	section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 required that a tribunal or Commissioner consider whether the purported exclusion of appeal rights by statutory instrument was contrary to Article 6 since this concerned the tribunal's own actions, even if the decision appealed against was taken prior  
to commencement of the Act: Wilson v. First County Trust Ltd (No. 2) [2002] QB 74 followed (paragraphs 30-37).",1,283,138,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support by automated credit transfer. He was abroad from December 1995 to June 1996 but did not inform the Benefits Agency of his absence, with the result that payment of income support continued throughout his absence, giving rise to an overpayment. The Benefits Agency discovered the overpayment in September 1996, but did not act on the information until November 2000, when a supersession decision was made and the overpayment was determined to be recoverable. The claimant appealed. He argued before the tribunal and the Commissioner that the delay in acting on the information was in breach of his right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time under Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The tribunal held that delay prior to the making of the appeal could not be taken into account under Article 6, but that even if it could there was no breach of Article 6 because the tribunal had been able on the evidence available fairly to determine the issues.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal had properly explained its finding that the delay had not rendered the hearing unfair, but that did not necessarily mean that there had been no breach of the separate requirement in Article 6 that the hearing take place within a reasonable time (paragraphs 7 and 8);

2.	the correct approach to an alleged breach of that requirement is (following Dyer v. Watson) to consider first whether the time that has elapsed is one which, on its face and without more, gives cause for real concern, and only if that threshold is reached to examine the circumstances to establish whether the delay was in fact unreasonable (paragraph 9);

3.	time started to run for the purposes of Article 6 in July 2000 when the case was referred to a decision-maker for a supersession decision, as this was the point when the claimant's civil rights first required determination (paragraphs 10-23);

3.	the period from July 2000 to the appeal hearing in July 2002 was insufficient to cross the threshold which would render necessary a further examination of the circumstances (paragraph 23).

*Paragraphs 1, 21 and 22 to 29 only are reproduced.

The applicant was the absent parent of two children in respect of whom a child support maintenance assessment was made in October 1995. In June 1998 a child support appeal tribunal allowed an application for a departure direction by the parent with care. The applicant sought to challenge the tribunal decision by: (1) appeal to a Commissioner and then to the Court of Appeal, who dismissed his application for permission to appeal in June 2000 (both decisions are reported in R(CS) 2/01); (2) an unsuccessful application for review made in November 1998 and (3) an application for revision in April 2001 (revisions having replaced reviews with effect from 1 June 1999). He made no appeal against the decision on the first of those applications, but appealed against the refusal of revision to an appeal tribunal, who upheld the decision of the Secretary of State that the application had been out of time. The applicant appealed to a Commissioner, who dismissed his appeal and refused him permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The applicant then renewed his application to the Court of Appeal. By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal his application in April 2001 was treated as an appeal and the only issue of substance was whether the absolute time limit of thirteen months for appeals infringed Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in the case of a litigant in person faced with complex procedural legislation.

Held, dismissing the application, that:

1.	the applicant's right of access to the court had not been impaired as a time limit of 13 months adequately protected the essence of his right to go to a court (paragraph 23);

2.	the period of limitation pursued a legitimate aim of ensuring legal certainty and finality to all litigation (paragraph 24);

3.	a period of 13 months is by no means disproportionate even for a litigant in person (paragraph 26).",0,38,138,,

London Borough of Hounslow [2004] EWCA Civ 101,,"Recovery of overpayment - calculation of overpayment - whether, under the law applicable before 2.10.00, a deduction could be made for the ""amount ... properly payable"" in respect a period after the date on which termination of income support had brought the benefit period to an end

The claimant was awarded income support and housing benefit. She subsequently started work but did not report this fact to the local authority. In December 1998 a decision was made by an adjudication officer that she was no longer entitled to income support with effect from June 1998. That decision had the effect of bringing the benefit period to an end from June for housing benefit purposes. In February 1999 the local authority determined that there was a recoverable overpayment of housing benefit in respect of the period June to December 1998, calculated as being the whole amount of housing benefit awarded for that period.
The claimant appealed on the grounds that the calculation of the recoverable amount should include a deduction under regulation 104(a) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (""the Regulations"") of the ""amount ... properly payable"" during the period concerned, calculated as the amount her entitlement would have been if her earnings had been taken into account in the assessment.  The appeal tribunal rejected the appeal, considering that it was bound by the decision of the High Court in R v. Wyre Borough Counci, ex parte Lord,  which held that no such deduction could be made for any period after the termination of income support had brought the benefit period to an end. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner, who also rejected the appeal, holding that, although he was not bound by the decision in ex parte Lord, as he could see no good reason not to follow it, he would do so. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
By the time that the case reached the Court, regulation 104 had been replaced by an amended version, effective from 2 October 2000, which it was accepted would have required the local authority to make the deduction argued for by the claimant. However the Court had to consider the effect of regulation 104(a) as it was worded at the time of the decision under appeal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	The words ""amount ... properly payable"" in the former regulation 104(a) should not be construed as meaning the amount of benefit to which the claimant had an entitlement. If it did, regulation 104(a) would be otiose, as the question of entitlement would already have been dealt with under regulation 98 of the Regulations (paragraph 29);
2.	to the extent that the decision in ex parte Lord held to the contrary of point 1 above, that case was wrongly decided (paragraph 30);
3.	where a change of circumstances comes to the attention of the local authority belatedly, there will be a review of the claimant's award that will take effect from a past date. If the result of the review is that the claimant continues to have an entitlement to benefit at a reduced rate for the remainder of the benefit period, the definition of ""overpayment"" in regulation 98 will itself take account of that entitlement (paragraph 39);
 4.	the cases in which the former regulation 104(a) must have been intended to have effect are those where, following review, there was no entitlement to benefit at a reduced rate, including cases where, under regulation 67(1) of the Regulations, the change of circumstances that gave rise to the review itself had the effect of bringing the benefit period to an end (paragraph 40);
5.	the words ""amount ... properly payable"" in the former regulation 104(a) must be construed, in cases where the termination of income support had brought the benefit period to an end, to mean the 
amount that should have been determined to be payable on the basis of the claim as it would have appeared if, at the time of the relevant change of circumstances, (i) the change had been reported; and (ii) a fresh claim for housing benefit had been made (paragraph 44).
The decision of the appeal tribunal was set aside and the case remitted to the local authority to recalculate the recoverable overpayment in the light of the Court's judgment.",1,133,227,,

The claimant was exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment and compensation was paid to him on the basis that he had developed asbestos-induced pleural thickening (""the relevant disease""). The Secretary of State issued a certificate of recoverable benefits under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 seeking recovery of all benefits paid to the claimant during the period from 8.7.94 to 7.7.99 (""the relevant period"") on the ground that they had been paid ""in respect of"" the relevant disease. These benefits comprised disablement benefit paid in respect of pneumoconiosis, sickness, invalidity and incapacity benefits, income support and disability living allowance. The compensators appealed against the certificate on the ground that the benefits had been paid otherwise than in respect of asbestos-induced pleural thickening. The medical evidence showed the claimant to have other disabling illnesses, in particular, heart disease and chronic bronchitis. The tribunal accepted that disablement benefit had not been paid in respect of the pleural thickening and was not recoverable. They found the other benefits to be recoverable because the relevant disease had been one cause of disablement that had properly led to entitlement to those benefits. They rejected as irrelevant the compensators' argument that the claimant would have become incapable of work in any event by reason of his other illnesses. The compensators appealed. The Secretary of State did not challenge the tribunal's decision regarding disablement benefit. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the evidence accepted by the tribunal showed that, during 1994, the claimant was incapable of work only due to the combined effects of all the conditions from which he was suffering, whereas, from the beginning of 1995, he would have been incapable of work even if he had never been exposed to asbestos (paragraph 14);	

2.	a compensator's liability was to be confined to benefits the payment of which was caused by the relevant disease and the phrase ""in respect of"" was to be read in that sense, so that it was open to a compensator to avoid the recovery of benefits by showing that the Secretary of State would have paid them in respect of a pre-existing condition, even if the relevant disease had not been developed (paragraph 17);	

3.	therefore, as this was not a case where incapacity benefit or income support had been paid on a basis other than actual incapacity for work, sickness benefit, invalidity benefit, incapacity benefit or income support paid from 1 January 1995 until the end of the relevant period was not recoverable (paragraph 22);	

4.	the evidence did not show that the effects of the relevant disease ceased to be a vital factor in the claimant's entitlement to the mobility component of disability living allowance before the end of the relevant period and so all the mobility component was recoverable, but it did show that the effects of the relevant disease had no relevance to the claimant's entitlement to the care component and so none of the care component was recoverable (paragraphs 25 and 26).

The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the Secretary of State was to issue a fresh certificate of recoverable benefits.",1,72,,,

The claimant sought, inter alia, an award of higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance. She contended that she was virtually unable to walk in that she satisfied the statutory criteria set out in regulation 12(1)(a)(ii) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991. An appeal tribunal upheld the Secretary of State's decision to refuse her claim. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner citing a number of Commissioners' decisions which were favourable to the appeal. The issues and the relevant authorities were considered at an oral hearing.  

Held, refusing the appeal, that:

1.	although the term ""severe discomfort"" was a statutory phrase, its application to a claimant's case was a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal having regard to the evidence (paragraph 16);

2.	""true pain"" did not automatically mean ""something more than severe discomfort"". There were difficulties in equating the concept of pain with severe discomfort. A tribunal had to decide for itself, having regard to all relevant factors, whether there was severe discomfort (R(DLA) 4/98 followed) (paragraph 17);

3.	there was extensive case law on the statutory test set out in regulation 12(1)(a)(ii) from which certain propositions of law could be deduced (paragraph 19);
4.	all aspects of a claimant's walking resulting from physical disablement had to be considered and an evaluation of its quality then made (paragraph 21;

5.	it was not the law that only walking to the first halt required through severe discomfort is relevant. If the claimant recovered after a period of rest and continued walking without severe discomfort, the statutory test did not preclude such continued walking from being assessed in the light of the evidence (paragraph 22);

6.	time, speed, manner and distance of walking achieved without severe discomfort had to be balanced in order to reach an overall judgement on virtual inability to walk (paragraph 23).",1,91,,,

He was awarded a category A state retirement pension, including an additional pension, calculated after offset of the GMP under section 46 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. He appealed against the calculation of his additional pension. The tribunal adopted as correct a revised calculation by the Secretary of State at a lower rate.

As every aspect of the calculation was at issue, including the GMP, the Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and referred the case to the Inland Revenue for an officer of the Board to issue a formal decision about the GMP. Following the issue of that decision (which was not appealed) and further submissions, the Commissioner considered the calculation of the additional pension and replaced his provisional decision with the final decision below.

Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting his own decision to the same effect, that:

1.	where the calculation of a retirement pension is challenged on appeal, the Secretary of State (or appeal tribunal) must refer the matter to the Revenue for a  formal decision on the GMP, against which there is a separate right of appeal to a tax appeal tribunal (paragraphs 28-30, 43, Appendix B);

2.	any decision on a GMP or a contribution question is a  matter for the Revenue but all other steps in the calculation of retirement pension (including the aggregation of one or more GMPs) are matters for the Secretary of State with appeal to a (social security) appeal tribunal  (paragraphs 31-38, 43, Appendix B);

Amongst the evidence considered by the appeal tribunal, were three reports by examining medical practitioners (""EMPs""). The tribunal stated that it preferred the evidence of one of the EMPs to that of the other two. It transpired that the EMP whose evidence was preferred had also sat regularly as a medical member of appeal tribunals in the same locality and that he had sat on a number of occasions over the previous two years with the members of the present tribunal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner that the tribunal had given inadequate reasons for preferring the evidence of that EMP and that a breach of natural justice had occurred. The Deputy Commissioner, Sir Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw Bt QC, considered that a case of apparent bias had been made out and upheld the appeal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the test to be applied was that of the ""fair-minded and informed observer"" set out by the House of Lords in Lawal v. Northern Spirit Limited [2003] UKHL 35 (paragraph 1);

2.	the Deputy Commissioner had come to the view, following Lawal and In re Medicaments and Related Classes Goods (No. 2) [2001] 1 WLR 700, that an expert witness was in a different position from an advocate, where both were part-time members of a tribunal before whom they also appeared in their respective capacities. He considered that a well-informed layman might conclude from the number of occasions on which the EMP had sat as a medical member with two of the three members of the tribunal, that there was a real possibility of bias. He drew support from what was said by a Tribunal of Commissioners in paragraph 77 of CSDLA/1019/1999. The Court held that the Deputy Commissioner's reasoning was unimpeachable. The Court considered that the influence which the EMP, when sitting as a medical member, may reasonably be expected to have exerted during previous dealings with two of the three members would be ""worrying in the eyes of the fair-minded observer"" (paragraph 3);

3.	it was the extent of the relationship which might reasonably be expected to have developed between the EMP, when sitting as a medical member, and the two of the members of the tribunal which gave rise to the perceived risk of sub-conscious bias in this case. However, the Court was reluctant to pronounce on the extent to which the frequency with which the EMP had sat with those members had been determinant.",1,275,284,,

The claimant, who had an award of lower rate mobility component and lowest rate care component of disability living allowance, applied for supersession, seeking a more favourable award. On appeal from a same rate supersession decision, the tribunal was alleged to have asked the claimant to pick her handbag up from the floor and tip out its contents. On further appeal by the claimant, the Commissioner considered section 20(3) of the Social Security Act 1998 and the power of a tribunal, on a disability living allowance appeal, to carry out a physical examination or to ask the claimant to undergo a physical test. Section 20(3)(a) of the Social Security Act 1998 prohibits a tribunal from carrying out a physical examination of the claimant and section 20(3)(b) from requiring a claimant to undergo any physical test in order to test for actual or virtual inability to walk.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	a physical examination is more than mere observation of an activity performed by a claimant at someone's request. It is a structured investigation applying medically recognised techniques in an attempt to elicit objective signs of injury, disease or dysfunction. It may involve physical contact with the claimant, but this is not essential. (R 1/01 (IB)(T) approved);
2.	observing the performance of a task, such as emptying out a handbag, is not carrying out a physical examination because it is not applying medically recognised techniques;

3.	a physical test means performing an activity which demonstrates the extent of a claimant's ability to perform that activity or to  perform an activity involving similar or related functions;

4.	section 20(3)(b) is to be interpreted in its historical context as prohibiting the walking test which was formerly conducted by medical appeal tribunals; it does not confer a positive statutory authority to require a claimant to undergo a physical test for other purposes;

5.	however a tribunal may take account of what it observes a claimant doing without prompting or request and may invite a claimant to demonstrate an activity; if a claimant refuses the tribunal may be entitled to draw inferences from that refusal.",1,274,,,

The claimant's unborn baby died during pregnancy following complications including the development of severe maternal diabetes. Following the still-birth the claimant developed severe depression. She claimed damages for negligence against her general practitioner under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 and for psychiatric injury. The claim was settled. The Secretary of State issued a certificate under section 4 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 (""the 1997 Act"") seeking recovery of incapacity benefit (""IB"") paid to the claimant. The compensator appealed against the certificate on the grounds that IB had been paid partly in respect of diabetes for which the compensator was not responsible, that the claimant's depression was not attributable to the still-birth, and the claimant would not have been available for work in any event after the birth so that only the difference between IB and any other benefit that might have been awarded was recoverable. The tribunal, at a paper hearing, proceeded on the basis that the compensation had been paid in respect of an ""accident, injury or disease"" within section 1(1)(a) of the 1997 Act and dismissed the appeal. The compensator appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	The tribunal was right to proceed on the basis it did because either the death of the child in the womb or the communication of the diagnosis of the child's death and the subsequent still-birth constituted an ""accident"" or series of accidents or the claimant had suffered a psychiatric ""injury"" or her psychiatric illness was a ""disease"" within the meaning of section 1(1)(a) and the compensation had been paid in consequence of one or other of those events (Rand v. East Dorset Health Authority [2001] PIQR Q1 distinguished) (paragraphs 6-10);	

2.	The evidence showed that the main cause of incapacity was the psychiatric illness of the claimant following the loss of the child and there was no evidence that the claimant had been entitled to IB before her pregnancy or at any time before it was put into payment after the still-birth (paragraphs 13-15); 	

3.	Recovery of benefit could not be avoided on the ground that some other benefit would have been paid or benefit would have been paid on a different basis if the relevant injury had not occurred as there is no provision in the 1997 Act for that, but there was no reason why there should be recovery of a benefit where it could be shown that that particular benefit would have been paid due to a pre-existing cause even if the relevant accident had not occurred (paragraphs 16-18);

4.	The evidence did not show that the claimant's diabetes was incapacitating and so it had not been shown that IB would have been paid even if the relevant accident had not occurred (paragraph 19).",1,72,,,

The claimant's claim for disability living allowance was disallowed and her appeal from that decision was dismissed. Her case was that her ability to walk was very limited due to arthritis, and that she was liable to fall due both to giddiness and to difficulty in co-ordinating her crutches. In relation to the higher rate of the mobility component, the tribunal found her not virtually unable to walk. The tribunal also declined to award the lower rate on the ground that it was clear that in practice the claimant would not be walking in unfamiliar surroundings because of her limited mobility. The tribunal made no finding as to whether the claimant could use even familiar routes without guidance or supervision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, that appeal being supported by the Secretary of State.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	it was irrelevant whether the claimant actually walked on unfamiliar routes - the question was whether or not she could do so without guidance or supervision;

2.	furthermore, while a tribunal must ignore any ability to use familiar routes, it is not entitled to ignore any inability to use familiar routes.

The claimant was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and was required to sign the jobseeker's register fortnightly on a Monday. Under the provisions of regulation 23 of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (""the 1996 Regulations"") he was notified that he was required to attend an interview at the Jobcentre, but gave notice that he was unable to attend because he had chicken pox. The Employment Service computer generated a letter notifying him of a fresh interview date on 25 October 2001.  He attended to sign on as normal on 22 October but did not attend the interview on 25 October. A decision was made that he ceased to be entitled to jobseeker's allowance with effect from 23 October under regulation 25(1)(a) the 1996 Regulations on the ground that he had failed to attend the interview. He was informed of that decision when he attended to sign the register on 5 November, by which time he was too late to exercise his right under regulation 27 to show good cause for failure to attend within 5 days.  He therefore reapplied for jobseeker's allowance and requested that his claim be backdated for the period 23 October 2001 to 4 November 2001. Backdating was refused and the claimant appealed. He contended that he had not received the letter notifying him of the interview on 25 October.

The tribunal found that none of the statutory grounds for backdating the claimant's fresh claim were applicable. They treated the appeal as an appeal also against the decision that entitlement under his previous award had ceased. However, they found that the letter notifying him of the interview date fell to be treated as sent on the day it was posted by virtue of regulation 2(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. As they found as a fact that the letter had been posted, they considered that the question of whether he had actually received it was irrelevant.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal was correct to treat the appeal as an appeal also against the decision that entitlement under the previous award had ceased (CJSA/2327/2001) (paragraph 6);

2.	regulation 2(b) of the 1999 Regulations was not applicable to notifications under the 1996 Regulations (paragraph 7); 

3.	the governing provision was therefore section 7 of the Interpretation Act, which deems service of a document to have been effected if a letter containing it is properly despatched and, unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post (paragraphs 8-10);

4.	where the time of receipt was important it was open to a claimant to prove that he had not received the notification at all and that principle applied to notifications sent to the addressee under regulation 23 of the 1996 Regulations (applying ex parte Rossi and other authorities) (paragraphs 11-15); 

5.	on a balance of probability the claimant in this case did not receive the letter at all, and it followed that no notification had been made under regulation 23 and therefore that he had not ""failed to attend"" the interview (paragraph 16);
6.	the claimant therefore continued to be entitled to  jobseeker's allowance from 23 October to 4 November 2001 (paragraphs 1 and 17).",1,216,,,

The claimant had five life awards of disablement benefit under the pre-October 1986 provisions for four industrial accidents and one disease (PD 11). At the material time he was receiving a disablement pension in respect of one accident at the rate appropriate to a 15% disablement, the other awards having been paid as separate gratuities for assessments totalling 22%. In May 2002 he sought to reopen the awards to bring them within the post-September 1986 aggregation provisions in the light of new caselaw which held that gratuities became available for aggregation after seven years. The claimant argued that a fresh claim or basis for supersession was not necessary to allow aggregation, but that argument was rejected by a decision-maker.

On 8 November 2000 he made a fresh claim in respect of PD D1 (pneumoconiosis) on which he was assessed at 5% for life from 16 April 1986. The decision-maker aggregated the new assessment with the existing assessments, making a total of 42% rounded down to 40%. The decision-maker treated the claim as an application for supersession and increased disablement benefit with effect from 8 November 2000 but no earlier.

The claimant appealed to the tribunal against both decisions. The issue before the tribunal and before the Commissioner was whether the claimant was entitled to disablement pension at not less than 40% from 1 October 1986. The tribunal confirmed the decisions allowing aggregation only from the fresh claim. It was also argued before the Commissioner that aggregation was only to be operated where the result was more advantageous to the claimant than keeping the entitlement from two or more disablements separate.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:

1.	there was no entitlement to have the aggregation rules applied to pre-October 1986 claims when there was no fresh claim or occasion for reassessment (CI/1532/2002 followed) (paragraph 16);

2.	it made no difference that one of the pre-October 1986 claims had in fact been made later as it fell to be treated as made under the earlier scheme under transitional provisions (CI/1532/2002 followed) (paragraph 17);

3.	(obiter) a claimant could have the entitlement from two or more disablements assessed separately if that was more advantageous, but the options were to add in all the previous assessments or not to aggregate them at all (paragraphs 26-29);

4.	the claim of 8 November 2000 should be treated as a separate claim and not an application for  reconsideration of an earlier award, as section 107(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act applied equally to the post-September 1986 scheme to allow two or more concurrent entitlements (and therefore claims) to disablement benefit for different accidents or diseases (CI/12311/1996 followed in preference to CI/420/1994) (paragraphs 31-34);

5.	the claimant was therefore entitled to a disablement pension of 40% on his pneumoconiosis claim, incorporating all his previous percentages but backdated three months to 8 August 2000 (paragraph 35);

6.	the previous awards were revoked and extinguished under section 10 of the Social Security Act 1998 and regulation 6 of the Child Support and Social Security (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (paragraphs 36-37).",1,202,,,

The claimant was a supply teacher. During the academic year 2000-2001 she worked for a number of schools within the area of one local education authority for an average of 13.3 hours per week. She was paid at an hourly rate and received her payments on the 25th of each month. She worked on 17 July 2001 and was told by that school that there would probably be work for her on 17 and 18 September 2001. She claimed contribution-based jobseeker's allowance from 18 July 2001 (the beginning of the summer holidays). The Secretary of State decided that the claimant was not entitled to jobseeker's allowance. He accepted that she was not in remunerative work, but decided that her earnings were sufficient to disentitle her to benefit. The claimant's appeal was dismissed. The tribunal followed R(IS) 10/95 and held that each monthly payment of earnings received had to be taken into account over the period of a month, even though the claimant would have worked only for odd days and not for a whole month. On that basis each of the monthly payments received in June, July and August 2001 disentitled the claimant from benefit for the following month. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the tribunal erred in failing to disregard the earnings under regulation 99(2) and paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996. Those provisions provide that there shall be disregarded (subject to various stated exceptions) in the case of a claimant ""who, before the date of the claim - (a) has been engaged in part-time employment as an employed earner ... , and (b) has ceased to be engaged in that employment, whether or not that employment has been terminated,"" any earnings in respect of that employment. The Secretary of State supported the appeal. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	this case was not the same as CJSA/3689/99 [now reported as R(JSA) 2/03] in which the claimant was a permanent employee who worked term-time only - in that case the claimant had a regular cycle of work and it followed that she was to be treated as engaged in part-time employment throughout her cycle of work: therefore she had not ceased to be engaged in part-time employment during the school half-term in respect of which she had claimed jobseeker's allowance, so that her earnings did not fall to be disregarded under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996;

2.	however, in this case, the claimant did not have a regular cycle of work - a cycle of work cannot be established in the case of a supply teacher who works for odd days by agreement with a number of schools on an irregular basis;

3.	accordingly, the tribunal had erred in point of law in holding that the claimant's earnings did not fall to be disregarded under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1996 regulations;

The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal as being in error of point of law and substituted his own decision that the claimant's earnings from part-time employment be disregarded from 18 July 2001.",1,108,,,

The Secretary of State referred the claim to the Commissioner for determination whether she was precluded, by virtue of the forfeiture rule, from receiving widow's benefit. The issue for the Commissioner was whether she had unlawfully counselled the death of her husband. On reviewing the evidence the Commissioner found that she had played a significant part in the murder, although she had been suffering from depression at the time of the killing and had shown genuine remorse afterwards. The only social security benefit potentially accruing to her on proof of her husband's death was widow's pension for the period between her release from prison and her subsequent remarriage, and part of this would have been subject to an offset in respect of jobseeker's allowance received.

Held that:

1.	the claimant had ""unlawfully counselled the death"" of her husband within section 1(2) of the 1982 Act and the forfeiture rule therefore applied to the benefit at issue (paragraphs 8-9);

2.	her conviction for the statutory offence of soliciting to murder under section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 did not engage section 5 of the 1982 Act (which provides that a conviction for murder ousts the jurisdiction to modify the forfeiture rule) (paragraph 10);

3.	the forfeiture rule should not be modified in view of the significant part she had played in the killing of her husband and the relatively small amount of benefit at issue (paragraph 12).

The Commissioner remitted the case to the Secretary of State for any necessary determination on entitlement to benefit to be made in the light of his decision.

The claimant made a claim for council tax benefit in which he disclosed occupational pensions to which he and his wife were entitled. The local authority had already received notification from the Benefits Agency that he had been awarded income support and therefore they awarded council tax benefit, disregarding his actual income, as required by paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 to the Council Tax (General) Regulations 1992 (""the 1992 Regulations""). The claimant had not disclosed the occupational pensions to the Benefits Agency prior to the making of the income support award. When the Benefits Agency became aware of the occupational pensions they removed his entitlement to income support from the date of the original award, and a similar decision was then made in relation to council tax. The claimant appealed against the authority's decision that the resulting overpayment of council tax was recoverable. The tribunal held that the authority's failure to make any inquiries of the Benefits Agency as to the correctness of the claimant's income support award constituted an ""official error"", and that the overpayment had been caused by that official error and therefore by virtue of regulation 84(2) of the 1992 Regulations the overpayment was irrecoverable. The authority appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that (1) while it would have been prudent for them to have asked the Benefits Agency to check the income support award in the light of the information about the occupational pensions, the fact that they did not do so was not a mistake and (2) even if it was, that mistake had not caused the overpayment.

Held allowing the appeal, that:

1.	under the statutory provisions the claimant, being in receipt of income support, was entitled to council tax benefit, and the information before the authority did not demonstrate that the income support award had been wrongly made (paragraph 22);

2.	in those circumstances the fact that they did not inquire as to the correctness of the income support award was not a mistake and so not an official error (paragraph 22);

3.	even if it had been a mistake, the primary cause of the overpayment was not that mistake but the claimant's failure to make proper disclosure of the occupational pensions in connection with his income support claim (paragraph 26).",1,228,,,

The claimant made a claim for housing benefit in April 2000 giving the figure for working families tax credit (WFTC) that she was receiving at the time, and benefit was calculated on that figure and awarded. The decision notice clearly set out the income on which the calculation was based and advised her of her duty to inform the authority of any change of circumstances, including in particular any change in her income. However, when the amount of WFTC was increased by the Inland Revenue, she did not inform the authority of the change until she made a renewal claim in October 2000, when she also informed them she had made a renewal claim for WFTC. Again housing benefit was awarded based on the figure she had given and again when the Inland Revenue later increased the amount of her WFTC, she did not inform the authority. In March 2001 the authority redetermined her entitlement for both periods and decided that the overpaid housing benefit was recoverable. The claimant appealed against the recoverability decision for the second period, contending that the overpayment was caused by an official error on the part of the authority and therefore, by virtue of regulation 99 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, not recoverable. The tribunal dismissed her appeal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner. It was argued on her behalf that the authority erred in making any award of housing benefit while the decision on the WFTC renewal claim was pending.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	it was not an ""error"" or ""mistake"" in terms of regulation 99 for the authority to make an award based on the best information currently available and to trust the claimant to inform them if it transpired that it was incorrect (paragraph 13);

2.	in any event what caused the overpayment in this case was the claimant's own failure to notify the Council of the true amount of her WFTC entitlement as soon as the figure she had given became incorrect.

South Northamptonshire District Council and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2004] EWCA Civ 409,,"Human rights - Articles 9 and 14 - freedom of religion and indirect discrimination - whether in deciding if tenancy was on a commercial basis factors relating to claimants' religion should be left out of account - whether housing benefit is a possession for purposes of Article 1 of Protocol 1 - whether regulation 7(1A) of the Housing Benefit Regulations was ultra vires 

The claimants were all members of the Jesus Fellowship Church and had agreed to live communally, pooling their income and giving their capital to the church. It had been established in previous court decisions that the various agreements under which they occupied their homes created a genuine legal liability. The local authority withdrew housing benefit on the grounds that, under regulation 7(1) and (1A) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 as amended with effect from 1 January 1999, the claimants were to be treated as not liable because the agreements were not on a commercial basis.

An appeal tribunal weighed up all the relevant factors and concluded that the agreements were not commercial. It also rejected a submission that regulation 7(1A) was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. A Commissioner dismissed the claimants' further appeals, holding that the tribunal had not gone wrong in its analysis of the commerciality of the arrangement; the cases fell within the ambit of Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion) and (obiter) that Article 14 of the Convention covered indirect discrimination; however, any difference in treatment was a proportionate response to the legitimate aim of preventing abuse of the housing benefit scheme and there was no reason to suspect an improper purpose on the part of the Secretary of State. He also rejected an argument, based on Howker v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ (reported as R(IB) 3/03), that regulation 7(1A) was invalid because the Social Security Advisory Committee had been misled as to its effect on religious communities.

The claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The questions for the Court were 
(1) whether it was an infringement of the claimants' Convention rights to take into account factors which were manifestations of religious belief in determining the factual question of whether a tenancy was on commercial basis; (2) whether the removal of the claimants from housing benefit effected by the 1998 amendment was in breach of Article 14 taken with Article 1 of Protocol 1 (protection of property); (3) whether regulation 7(1A) was invalid for Howker reasons. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the issue of whether there was or was not a commercial basis was purely factual and the Convention could not and did not purport to change facts or make evidence relevant to a factual enquiry inadmissible (paragraphs 13, 60-61)

2.	even if there had been discrimination any difference in treatment would have been proportionate (paragraphs 21-30);

3.	housing benefit as a non-contributory benefit was not a possession for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the Convention: Carson followed: Poirrez distinguished (paragraphs 31-38);

4.	moreover there could be no possession at the date the amendment was made as the Human Rights Act was not then in force (paragraph 39);

The claimant who suffered from cerebral palsy and was partially deaf had a life-time award of mobility allowance which became an award of mobility component of disability living allowance in 1992. In December 2000 he applied for supersession on the basis that he had care needs. A doctor from his GP practice completed a standard questionnaire about his mobility and care needs. His GP also wrote a letter saying his condition was permanent.

The Secretary of State made a decision on supersession that the clamant was not entitled to the care component and was no longer entitled to the mobility component. In relation to mobility he gave as his reason that the claimant could manage to walk 400-1000 meters on a good day and was not virtually unable to walk. A tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State's decision. The Commissioner allowed the claimant's appeal but not on grounds relating to supersession of the life-time award. The claimant appealed.  It was agreed by both parties that there was no evidence of a change in the claimant's ability to walk.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	a decision awarding benefit could not be superseded under section 10 of the Social Security Act 1998 unless one of the grounds for supersession set out in regulation 6 of the Social Security  and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 was satisfied. There had been no finding of a relevant change of circumstances in this case and the Secretary of State was not entitled to supersede the claimant's award of mobility component

2.	(per curiam) section 12(9) of the Social Security Act 1998 must be construed so as to give a right of appeal from a rejection by the Secretary of State of a properly constituted application for a supersession under section 10 of the 1998 Act.",1,256,,,

Attention in connection with bodily functions - meaning of ""significant portion of the day""

The claimant, aged 12 at the date of his renewal claim for disability living allowance, suffered incontinence of the bowel as a result of spina bifida and subsequent corrective surgery. For psychological reasons he did not use incontinence pads. He required attention once or twice a day after soiling himself.  On these occasions it was necessary for him to get into the bath and for his mother to help him undress, carefully remove his soiled clothing and shower him until he was clean. It was also necessary to wash soiled clothing, towels and bedding and clean up any soiled furniture, carpets and other surfaces. The adjudication officer refused to renew the award and a tribunal confirmed the decision, finding that the claimant did not require attention for a significant portion of the day. In assessing whether or not the attention given amounted to a significant portion of the day, the tribunal took into account the undressing, showering and rinsing out of soiled clothing, but specifically excluded the washing of clothing, citing Cockburn v. Adjudication Officer [reported as R(DLA) 2/98].  The tribunal did not mention the cleaning up of furniture, carpets and other surfaces. The claimant  appealed to a Commissioner, who upheld the tribunal's decision.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	whilst the decision in Cockburn made it clear that the laundering of soiled bedclothes or clothes out of the presence of the claimant could not qualify as attention, it equally recognised that certain acts performed by way of immediate and essential cleaning-up after an incident of incontinence might qualify as attention (paragraph 37);	

2.	steps taken in the presence or vicinity of the applicant for the immediate removal of soiling from clothes, bed linen or adjacent surfaces were apt to qualify as attention, and in a case of faecal incontinence where the interests of hygiene required thorough washing rather than merely rinsing, the criteria of immediacy and intimacy were sufficiently satisfied (paragraph 37);

3.	whether the portion of a day spent in attention was ""significant"" depended principally upon its size or significance assessed as a percentage of the day as a whole but also upon other factors such as the amount of time available in the day, the extent to which the relevant tasks become a matter of routine, and the concentration and intensity of the activity (paragraph 39).

The claimant became incapable of work in February 2000. He was awarded incapacity benefit and national insurance credits. In February 2001 the claimant was examined by an EMP and, subsequently, the Secretary of State decided that he was capable of work on and from 2 March 2001. The claimant appealed on 6 March 2001 and in that connection was represented by solicitors from at least 21 March 2001. On 6 April 2001 the solicitor sought a medical report from the claimant's GP, who, the following day, agreed to provide it. The tribunal hearing was set for 30 May 2001, and on 14 May the solicitor inquired by telephone as to the report, learning that it was not yet ready. No other steps were taken until the 29 May 2001, on which date the telephone inquiry to the GP's office was renewed. The report was not ready. At the hearing the next day the solicitor applied for an adjournment to provide time to obtain a medical report. The tribunal refused that application and also dismissed the substantive appeal. Thereafter the claimant obtained a statement of reasons which made no reference to the refusal to adjourn, although this was briefly referred to in the decision notice issued on the day of the hearing. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner in relation to the lack of reasons given for the refusal to adjourn. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	(per Laws LJ) there is, in the whole legislative scheme of the 1998 Act, a plain distinction between a decision on entitlement to benefit, and what may conveniently called a determination (that is determination of any matter along the way leading to a decision, including a determination of a procedural issue such as an application for an adjournment): the right to a statement of reasons under regulation 53(4) of the Social Security (Decision Making and Appeals) Regulations 1999 applies only to a decision thus understood and not to a determination (paragraph 14);

2.	Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights does not have an impact on regulation 53(4) as in relation to the duty to give reasons the common law may, in any event, impose such a duty in relation to the grant or refusal of an adjournment if it was held that fairness demanded it (paragraph 22);

3.	furthermore, it is clear that in the ordinary way , and as a matter of practical good sense, any obligation to give reasons for an ancillary or procedural act, such as the refusal of an adjournment, will be relatively summary in nature (paragraph 25); 

4.	additionally, it is impossible to conclude that the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court, in a context such as the present, would require a higher standard for the giving of reasons than that which the Commissioner had set out in his decision (paragraph 26);

5.	 in relation to the brief reference to the refusal to adjourn given by the tribunal in the decision notice, such reference was addressed to a tutored audience and, moreover, it was for the appellant to establish solid grounds to grant the adjournment - accordingly the Commissioner had not erred in law in failing to hold the reasons in the decision notice inadequate (paragraph 29);

6.	it was plain that the refusal of the adjournment was not perverse (paragraph 31).

A claim form for income support was requested on behalf of the claimant by a hospital social worker on 21 December 2001. By regulation 4(5) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (""the 1987 Regulations"") that date was the date of notification of intention to make a claim, and by regulation 6(1A) if the claimant sent his properly completed form to an appropriate office within one month, the effective date of his claim would be 21 December. The form was not sent out until 7 January 2002, the day on which the claimant died. The claimant's executor completed and signed the form on 18 January 2002 and handed it to the relevant office on that same day, i.e. within the one month time limit. The claim was rejected on the ground that no valid claim had been made because the claimant had died before the form was signed and submitted. A tribunal upheld that decision. Neither regulation 33 (persons unable to act) nor regulation 30 (payments on death) of the 1987 Regulations dealt with a situation where a person had died between the date of notification and the submission of the claim. Regulation 30(5) specifically excluded income support from benefits for which posthumous claims could be made in certain circumstances.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	a person who by the date of his death has merely given notification of intention to claim has not in fact made a claim (paragraph 18(1)); 

2.	once the potential claimant has died, he is no longer a person who can claim or on whose behalf a claim can be made, since all agency is terminated by death (paragraph 18(2)); 

3.	it followed that express or implied statutory authority was required to enable a claim to be made in respect of a deceased person, and there was no such authority in the 1987 Regulations in relation to income support (paragraph 18(3)); 

4.	no implication could be derived from the scheme in the 1987 Regulations that the executor was entitled to make the claim in respect of the deceased and so as it were perfect it. Indeed, the absence of any express provision for the making of the claim in such circumstances suggested the contrary implication, because there was no reason why the legislature should have intended to treat cases where there was a will more favourably than cases where the deceased died intestate (paragraph 18(4)).",1,59,,,

Commissioner  - appeal to the Court of Appeal - whether court should consider arguments from the Secretary of State which were not developed before the Commissioner 

The claimant was partially sighted. She made a claim for disability living allowance, which was refused. She appealed and an appeal tribunal awarded lower rate mobility component, but concluded that she did not meet the statutory criteria for care component. She then appealed to the Commissioner against refusal of care component on the ground, among others, that the tribunal had failed to make findings of fact about her attention needs at school. The Secretary of State submitted that the assistance provided at school was for the claimant's educational needs and not in connection with any bodily function. The Commissioner issued directions giving his provisional view that some at least of the assistance at school qualified as ""attention in connection with"" the bodily function of seeing and that the claimant required frequent attention during term-time substantially in excess of that required by a child of her age without disability. The Secretary of State responded briefly in a submission which did not clearly raise any issue as to whether the need for assistance identified by the Commissioner constituted a need for ""attention"". In his final decision the Commissioner allowed the appeal and decided that assistance provided in the classroom was in connection with the bodily function of seeing, was reasonably required for the claimant's education, and was of a sufficiently personal nature to count as ""attention"". The attention she needed during the school holidays was not, in the Commissioner's view, significant enough to qualify, but taking a broad view, he decided she met the conditions for an award of the middle rate care component of disability living allowance, which he awarded for two years.

The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal, submitting that the classroom assistance did not constitute attention, was not required frequently, was not substantially in excess of that required by a child of her age without disability and was not required throughout the year. The Commissioner granted permission on the ground that the issue as to whether the classroom assistance constituted attention was probably an issue of law of wider importance.

 Held, dismissing the appeal, that;

1.	it would not be right for the court to embark upon consideration of what amounted to a root and branch attack on parts of the Commissioner's decision which, despite the ample opportunity provided,  had not been the subject of any real submissions to him (paragraphs 15-16);

A child, who was autistic, had been placed by the local authority under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 in a private residential school for pupils with special educational needs. He spent school holidays with his mother, who at the time of the placement was the person with care. The father appealed against the child support maintenance assessment, arguing among other things that it should be reduced under regulation 25 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (""the MASC Regulations"") to exclude the days of residence at the boarding school. He also referred to regulation 51 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 (""the MAP Regulations""). The tribunal dismissed the appeal, concluding that, under regulation 27 of the MASC Regulations, the mother remained the person with care as, but for the placement in the boarding school, she would otherwise provide day to day care. The Secretary of State supported the father's appeal to the Commissioner, submitting that the local authority provided day to day care during term-time and that therefore regulation 25 should be applied instead of regulation 27.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:

1.	the meaning of ""boarding school"" in regulation 27 and in the definition of ""day to day care"" in regulation 1(2) covered any institution which was a school and which provided overnight accommodation for some pupils (paragraphs 24 and 32);

2.	the tribunal was entitled to conclude that the mother remained the person with care by virtue of regulation 27 but had failed to explain why it rejected the argument that the assessment should be reduced under regulation 25. The two regulations were not mutually exclusive in their application. A conclusion that the mother in this case was to be treated as the parent with care by virtue of regulation 27 did not entail a conclusion that there could not be an adjustment under regulation 25 (paragraphs 17 and 25-28);

3.	there was nothing plain and obvious in regulation 25 to indicate that the general definition of ""day to day care"" in regulation 2(1), including the exception relating to boarding schools, should not be read into it. It followed that, if a person fell to be treated as providing day to day care during term-time by virtue of regulation 2(1) and was actually providing day to day care during school holidays, then the local authority could not be treated as providing day to day care at all and the necessary condition for the application of regulation 25 was not satisfied (paragraphs 29-32);

4.	a local authority was not to be taken to be providing day to day care merely by placing a child in a boarding school in the exercise of its powers under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 and paying all the fees. Day to day care concentrated on the immediate, short-term and mundane aspects of care (R(CS) 11/02) or the direct, rather than indirect, provision of care (CCS/1324/1997) (paragraphs 34-36);

5.	regulation 51 of the MAP Regulations did not apply, because the mother was not a person with whom the child was placed by the local authority (paragraph 28);

6.	the tribunal also failed to deal adequately with the father's contentions on the calculation of his net income and his housing costs (paragraphs 8-16).

19.6.03

Maintenance assessment - subsequent revision because absent parent not habitually resident - whether error of child support officer ""official error"" - whether child support officer was ""an officer of the Department of Social Security acting as such ... ""

In 1994 an interim child support maintenance assessment was made against the absent parent (Mr P) in respect of a child (who was the son of Mr P and Miss R). By a decision in 1998 a child support officer cancelled that assessment as from 1998 on the ground that Mr P was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom. By a decision in 2001 the Secretary of State purported to revise the 1998 decision so as to make the cancellation operative from 1994 on the ground that the evidence on which the 1998 child support officer had acted showed that Mr P had not been habitually resident in the UK in 1994. An appeal tribunal dismissed Miss R's appeal against that decision.

Before the Commissioner, the question arose as to which power had been used by the 2001 decision-maker to revise the 1998 decision. The only possible applicable ground for allowing a revision to take effect from 1994 was that specified in regulation 17(1)(c) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992. That provision allowed for revision on the ground of ""official error"", which was defined in regulation 1(2) as ""an error made by (a) an officer of the Department of Social Security acting as such which no person outside that Department caused or to which no person outside that Department materially contributed; ..."". The question therefore arose as to whether the child support officer who had acted in 1998 was ""an officer of the Department of Social Security acting as such"".

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	a person acting in the capacity of a child support officer was ""an officer of the Department of Social Security acting as such"" within the definition of ""official error"" in regulation 1(2) of the 1992 Regulations (para. 24);

2.	such a person was ""acting as such"" in the sense that the function (or one of the functions) to which he had been assigned, as an officer of the Department, was to act as a child support officer (para. 24);

3.	the words ""acting as such"" were not intended to restrict the definition to persons acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, such conclusion being reached for various reasons, including reference to the amendment (made in June 2000) to the definition of ""official error"". That amendment added to the definition a sub-paragraph (b) which referred to persons ""employed by"" and ""acting on behalf of"" the Secretary of State, and, that being so, sub-paragraph (a) might be argued to be redundant unless it did include child support officers who were not ""acting on behalf of"" the Secretary of State (paras. 25 to 34, para. 31);

4.	in R(I) 5/02, where the contrary view was taken by the Tribunal of Commissioners, the view that decisions made by adjudication officers under the pre-Social Security Act 1998 regime could be revised for official error was not actually argued. Both sides appeared to have proceeded in that case on the footing that the view there taken by the Tribunal as to the effect of the words ""acting as such"" was correct (para. 35);

5.	furthermore the Tribunal of Commissioners also appeared not to have been referred to the amendment of the definition of ""official error"" as from 19 June 2000 (para. 35);

6.	in those circumstances the Commissioner was not obliged to follow R(I) 5/02, and, therefore, mistakes by former child support officers were capable of falling within the definition of ""official error"" (para. 35).

The Commissioner set aside the decision of the appeal tribunal and remitted the case for consideration by a new tribunal.",1,255,,,

The claimant was awarded compensation in respect of an injury to his right eye in an accident at work. The Secretary of State issued a certificate of recoverable benefits to the compensator seeking to recover incapacity benefit paid to the claimant on two separate claims. The compensator appealed on the ground that the certificate showed benefit which was not paid as a result of the accident. Expert medical evidence was produced, which showed that the claimant had pre-existing loss of sight in the right eye and that the accident had no disabling effect for more than a week following the accident. Most of the incapacity benefit at issue had been awarded under regulation 28 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995, which provides that a claimant shall be deemed to satisfy the all work test on the production of medical evidence in the prescribed form (normally a Med 3 signed by a GP). The diagnosis given in that medical evidence by his GP was injury to right eye, combined with depression on the second claim. The issue before the Commissioner was whether a payment of incapacity benefit under regulation 28 based on medical evidence linked to the relevant accident, injury or disease could be found to be paid otherwise than in respect of that accident, injury or disease.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the issue in this case was different from those addressed by the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(CR) 2/02, where there was only one potential cause of incapacity (paragraphs 22-25);

2.	one must look at the substance of the diagnosis stated by a doctor on a Med 3 certificate, or any other form of medical evidence accepted for the purpose of regulation 28, to ascertain whether it is sufficiently linked to the relevant accident, injury or disease to indicate that that accident, injury or disease was an effective cause of the certificate being given and incapacity benefit being awarded (paragraphs 26 and 27);

3.	if it is shown that for all or some of the period of receipt of incapacity benefit under regulation 28 the relevant accident, injury or disease was not an effective cause of any disablement, then to that extent the incapacity benefit cannot be included in a certificate of recoverable benefits (paragraph 28);

4.	in this case the medical evidence showed that the accident was not an effective cause of disablement in any such period, since for the first period of receipt of incapacity benefit the claimant's disablement resulted entirely from the pre-existing condition of his right eye and for the second period from that cause and from his depressive illness (paragraphs 29-33). 	

The Commissioner substituted his own decision revoking the certificate.",1,72,,,

The claimant had been in receipt of income support at a reduced rate as an asylum seeker.  He was granted exceptional leave to remain on 9 July 2000 and on 24 August 2000 he claimed income support at the full rate, including a disability premium, backdated to 9 July 2000. On 30 August 2000 a decision-maker decided that he was entitled to increased income support only from 24 August 2000 and that he was not entitled to a disability premium because he had not been submitting medical certificates in support of a claim for incapacity benefit before 25 May 2000. On 13 September 2000 the claimant appealed, producing with his appeal retrospective evidence of incapacity for work. The appeal tribunal confirmed the decision and declined to deal with the disability premium, which they considered would have been the subject of a separate decision by the incapacity benefit section of the Benefits Agency. The Secretary of State supported the claimant's appeal to the Commissioner, submitting that the tribunal had erred in failing to deal with the disability premium, and that the claimant was entitled to a disability premium. 

Under the current form of paragraph 12(1)(b) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations (paragraph 12(1)(b)) the claimant's entitlement to disability premium depended upon deemed incapacity for work under regulation 28 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 for a minimum of 364 days. The condition for deemed incapacity was the production of evidence of incapacity in accordance with the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 (""the Medical Evidence Regulations""). It had been established in R(IS) 8/93 that retrospective medical evidence was acceptable for the purposes of regulation 2(1) of the Medical Evidence Regulations in its form before 13 April 1995 and specifically for entitlement to disability premium under the version of paragraph 12(1)(b) then in force. The question for the Commissioner was whether that legislation in its current form and regulation 28 could be satisfied by the production of retrospective medical evidence.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	It was clear from the wording of  regulation 2(1)(d) of the Medical Evidence Regulations that that regulation in its current form could be satisfied in respect of periods prior to the coming into existence or the putting forward of the evidence in question (paragraphs 13-14);

2.	there was nothing in the wording of the present form of paragraph 12(1)(b) to exclude the use of retrospective evidence (paragraph 15);
3.	regulation 28 could in its terms be applied to any period for which the question of deemed incapacity for work needed to be decided and retrospective evidence of incapacity was therefore acceptable where a past period was in issue (paragraphs 19-21);

4.	however, the evidence of incapacity was produced after the date of the decision under appeal to the tribunal and, since the physical production of evidence was the key circumstance for the purposes of regulation 28, both the tribunal and the Commissioner were prevented by section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 from taking it into account (paragraphs 26-33);

5.	The Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and referred the case to the Secretary of State for consideration of a revision of the decision of 30 August 2000 under regulation 3(4A) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999.

Note: On 22 January 2004 the Secretary of State informed the Commissioner that the decision of 30 August 2000 had been revised, so as to increase the amount of income support entitlement from 24 August 2000 by the inclusion of the disability premium in the claimant's applicable amount. The Commissioner issued a final decision, dated 23 January 2004, to the effect that the appeal against the decision of 30 August 2000 had lapsed.",1,172,168,,

On 25 April 2000 the claimant claimed disablement benefit in respect of prescribed disease A11 (vibration white finger). He was examined by a medical practitioner on 28 June 2000 and told the doctor that he first had trouble with his hands in 1988. The doctor decided he was not suffering from the prescribed disease and the Secretary of State adopted that opinion. The claimant appealed and, on 7 November 2000, an appeal tribunal allowed his appeal, deciding that from 1 January 1991 the claimant had suffered a loss of faculty due to prescribed disease A11 and that the resulting disablement was to be assessed at four per cent. from 16 April 1991 for life. Neither party sought a statement of reasons for that decision or sought leave to appeal.  On 25 January 2001, the claimant claimed reduced earnings allowance. The Secretary of State disallowed the claim on the ground that the onset of the disease had been after 1 October 1990 so that the proviso at the end of paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 7 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 applied. The claimant appealed and the tribunal dismissed his appeal on 7 January 2002, relying on the finding by the tribunal on 7 November 2000 that the claimant had suffered a loss of faculty due to the prescribed disease only since 1 January 1991. It was against the decision of 7 January 2002 that the claimant appealed with the leave of the Commissioner.  The hearing of the appeal was deferred to await the decision in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions .v Whalley [2003] EWCA Civ 166 (reported as R(I)2/03), in which it was held that a decision made before the Social Security Act 1998 came into force as to the date of onset of a prescribed disease was final and bound any subsequent decision-maker.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	whereas under the pre-1998 Act legislation a decision that a claimant had not suffered from a prescribed disease had been freestanding and final and so had precluded any later finding that the claimant had suffered from a prescribed disease during the period to which the decision related, such a finding on diagnosis was not final under the 1998 Act (paragraphs 7 to 14);

2.	nonetheless, a finding as to the date of onset of a prescribed disease made in a disablement pension case was conclusive in a reduced earnings allowance case by virtue of regulation 6(1) of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985 (paragraph 14);

3.	the decision of 7 November 2000 incorporated a finding that the date of onset of the prescribed disease had been 1 January 1991 and that finding was conclusive for the purposes of the reduced earnings allowance claim before the tribunal sitting on 7 January 2002 (paragraphs 15 to 18); 

4.	but the tribunal were faced with a clear submission that the decision of 7 November 2000 was wrong and, on the facts of the case, they should have exercised their power to adjourn to allow consideration to be given to supersession of that decision (paragraphs 19 to 23).",1,183,275,,

The obligation to give a copy of the statement to each of the parties ""as soon as may be practicable"" related to the clerk.

2.	for a breach of a procedural rule to constitute an error of law, the breach must be material: this did not arise on the facts. (R(IS) 11/99 affirmed) (paragraph 30);
3.	it is a basic precept of justice that reasons are communicated promptly. Even if reasons given late are an accurate account, delay can result in them appearing less credible and therefore more easily attacked as inadequate (paragraph 34).",1,282,,,

In January 2001 the claimant claimed disablement benefit for ""hand arm vibration syndrome, vibration white finger"". He described his symptoms and enclosed a long report dated 15 November 2000 (in the context of a possible civil claim for damages) by Dr Herdman, an occupational health physician, which found that the claimant's fingers went white on exposure to cold. From 1954 to 1994 the claimant had worked in occupations using tools mentioned in the prescription of prescribed disease A11.  He had not done so since October 1994. In December 2001 a Benefits Agency doctor (who had Dr Herdman's report) examined the claimant. He diagnosed white changes of fingers, cause unknown, and stated that there was no evidence of vibration white finger - the white changes were not like the gradual evolution of vibration white finger - and that the condition could not therefore be diagnosed. On 12 December 2001 the Secretary of State decided that the claimant was not entitled to disablement benefit as he had not been diagnosed as suffering from prescribed disease A11.  
The claimant appealed and attended a tribunal hearing in July 2002. In evidence he said that he had noticed whiteness of the fingers in 1988. All four fingers of each hand were affected from the tips to the level of where the ring is. The backs of the fingers were affected, but the claimant did not notice it as much on the fronts - they did not go completely white on the fronts of the fingers, just slightly white, whereas the backs were a proper white. 
The appeal tribunal disallowed the appeal and confirmed the Secretary of State's decision. They held that the evolution of PD A11 was gradual with the whiteness affecting more fingers and more of each affected finger, as time went by and exposure to vibration continued.  The claimant did not have true circumferential whitening. Dr Herdman's report did not deal with either of those aspects. Thus the whiteness of the fingers to the full extent from the onset and the lack of a true circumferential whitening of the fingers was to be interpreted anatomically as meaning that there was unlikely to be blanching within the terms of the prescription.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	neither the lack of circumferential blanching nor a history of a sudden onset of extensive blanching was a bar to the diagnosis of PD A11. The diagnosis question depended simply on the presence of sufficient blanching of sufficient fingers. What amounts to blanching in any particular case was a matter for the medical expertise of doctors carrying out examinations and medically qualified members of appeal tribunals. CI/3596/2001 followed; CI/1807/2002 not followed (paragraphs 17-21); 

2.	the factors mentioned above may be relevant to whether the overall history given by a claimant was to be accepted or to whether the disease was due to the nature of the claimant's employment (where there was a presumption in the claimant's favour) (paragraphs 15 and 22-25);

3.	on the question of diagnosis the cause of the condition was irrelevant (paragraph 16).

The trustees of the claimant's occupational pension scheme paid 50% of his pension directly to his former wife under a court order made under section 25B of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. A decision-maker decided that the full amount of the pension was ""payable to"" the claimant within the meaning of section 30DD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and therefore that the amount of pension payable to the claimant exceeded the threshold above which receipt of pension payments operated to reduce entitlement to incapacity benefit under that section. If the sums earmarked for payment to his former wife had not been treated as payable to the claimant, no reduction would have applied. The claimant appealed and the appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the sums paid to the claimant's former wife were not ""payable to"" him within the ordinary meaning of those words (paragraph 13);

2.	while section 25B(6)(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act provided that the payments to his former wife should be treated as paid by him, it did not follow that they should be treated as paid or payable to him (paragraph 14);

3.	section 30DD was introduced by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which focused specifically on the position of pensions on divorce. There was therefore some argument for saying that, if the legislator had intended that sums diverted to a former spouse under an earmarking order should be treated as payable to a claimant for incapacity benefit purposes, the opportunity would have been taken expressly so to provide (paragraph 15).

The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the amount of incapacity benefit was not reduced by reason of the claimant's entitlement to occupational pension.",1,171,,,

Maintenance assessment - child sometimes staying in residential unit attached to his school - residential unit funded by local education authority - whether local authority providing ""day to day care"" - whether child at a boarding school
There was a child support maintenance assessment in respect of a child (D), whose PWC was his mother. D attended a school for children with physical and other difficulties to which there was attached a residential unit which offered respite care and other support for pupils and their families. The unit was funded from the local authority's education budget. D stayed overnight at the unit more frequently than on a purely respite basis. D's father (the AP) contended that the local authority was providing some day to day care for D and that the case was therefore a special one by virtue of regulation 25 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992. He argued that the proper application of regulation 25 would result in a reduction in his liability for child support maintenance. However, the Secretary of State argued that D was a boarder at a boarding school under regulation 27. Applying that regulation, the provision of care by the school would be disregarded and D would be treated as being in the care of the person who would have his care if he were not at school - i.e. his mother.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the arrangements made in respect of D did not amount to him being in the care of the local authority within the meaning of sections 22 and 23 of the Children Act 1989 (paragraphs. 18 to 21);

2.	references to a local authority in the child support legislation did not include the functions of the local education authority, and in those circumstances the funding of the residential unit by the local education authority did not mean that the local authority was providing day to day care under regulation 25 (paragraph. 26);

3.	it was unnecessary to decide whether the combination of a school and residential unit in this case amounted to a boarding school as on these facts D's mother was the person with care whether or not regulation 27 applied (paragraph. 32).

The Commissioner upheld the decision of the appeal tribunal.",1,43,,,

The claimant was a Portuguese national, who retained his rights as a ""worker"" under EC law while permanently incapable of work. He received income support, including an allowance for a child/ young person in respect of his stepdaughter. The Secretary of State decided that the allowance should not have been paid during a period of almost two years when the stepdaughter spent periods living in Portugal. The claimant appealed to a tribunal. It was accepted implicitly by the tribunal that the claimant was not entitled to the dependent's allowance for any period when his stepdaughter was abroad for more than four weeks by virtue of regulation 16(5)(a) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (the 1987 Regulations), but it referred the case back to the Secretary of State for the periods of absence to be checked. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that the decision of the tribunal was erroneous in law because it discriminated against him on the ground of his nationality. The Commissioner concluded that discrimination was not obviously there, but that the claimant was entitled to argue that he was being discriminated against under Article 7(2) of (EEC). Regulation 1612/68 He referred the matter to a new tribunal to consider whether the claimant could establish discrimination and if he could whether that could be justified. The claimant appealed against the Commissioner's decision and the Secretary of State cross-appealed, seeking to affirm the Commissioner's decision on different or additional grounds. The Commissioner had held (disagreeing with R 2/03 (DLA)) that Article 42 of Regulation 1612/68 excludes the application of (EEC) Regulation 1408/71 whenever a benefit is one of those listed in Annex IIA to Regulation 1408/71 (non-contributory benefits). Before the Court of Appeal both parties eventually agreed that the issue was to be decided under Regulation 1408/71, the Court having pointed out that both provisions unequivocally prohibit the different treatment of migrant workers and national workers in the grant and payment of the allowance. The claimant contended that regulation 16(5)(a) of the 1987 Regulations was intrinsically liable to operate in a discriminatory manner against migrant workers. The Secretary of State contended that such discrimination could not be established without statistical evidence.
Held, allowing the Secretary of State's cross-appeal, that:

1.	Commissioners and the court are entitled to take a broad approach and to find that indirect discrimination is liable to affect a significant number of migrant workers on the ground of nationality without statistical proof being available (O'Flynn v Adjudication Officer [1996] ECR I-2617 [R(IS) 4/98], Pinna v Caisse d'Allocations Familiales de la Savoie case 41/84  [1986] ECR 1, Commission v French Republic case C-37/97 [1998] ECR I/5341, Biehl v Luxemburg case 175/88 [1990] ECR I-1779) (paragraphs 24, 41 and 45);

2.	the limitation based on four weeks' absence of the child or young person from the United Kingdom was intrinsically liable to affect migrant workers more than national workers, and there was certainly a risk that it would place migrant workers at a particular disadvantage (paragraphs 26, 44).

The Court confirmed the order of the Commissioner and directed the new tribunal to decide whether the discrimination could be justified by the Secretary of State.

The deceased was a three month old baby who was being cared for by and living with his mother, then aged 17, and his grandmother. His mother was in receipt of child benefit for him but not in receipt of any of the qualifying benefits referred to in regulation 7(1)(a)(i) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 (""the Regulations""). The funeral directors refused to contract with the mother because she was under 18 so the grandmother took responsibility for the funeral expenses. The father was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance but lived separately from and had had no contact with the baby. The grandmother claimed a funeral payment on the basis that she was a ""close friend"" of the baby and fell within regulation 7(1)(e)(iv)(bb) of  the Regulations. Her claim was refused on the ground that she was precluded from applying for a payment because regulation 7(1)(e)(iv) only applied where regulation 7(1)(e)(i) or (ii) of the Regulations did not and in the circumstances of the case, regulation 7(1)(e)(ii) did apply because the mother, had she accepted responsibility for the funeral expenses, would have fallen within that provision. The Secretary of State did not at any stage contend that the grandmother could not be a ""close friend"" of the baby.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	It could not be said that an earlier head of regulation 7(1)(e) applied where, although there was a person who would have fallen within that head had he been able to take responsibility for the funeral expenses, that person was in practice prevented from taking such responsibility by lack of legal capacity or by doubts about his legal capacity (paragraph 10);

2.	owing to the mother's doubtful legal capacity and the attitude of the funeral directors there was no real possibility of the mother taking responsibility for the funeral expenses so regulation 7(1)(e)(ii) did not apply (paragraphs 12-13);

3.	children may be cared for by close relatives such as grandparents and uncles and aunts who are not within the definition of ""close relative"" and who therefore cannot qualify under regulation 7(1)(e)(iv)(aa). It could not have been intended that either the closeness of the family relationship or the very young age of the child should prevent relatives falling outside the definition of ""close relative"" from qualifying under the alternative ground of friendship in regulation 7(1)(e)(iv)(bb) and in that context ""friend"" must be read as not excluding cases where the affection is derived from family love or where the child is too young to be capable of anything amounting to friendship in the ordinary sense of that term (paragraph 15);

Civ 1343",,"Human rights - discrimination against former member of a heterosexual relationship - whether facts fall within the ambit of Article 8 - whether discrimination can be justified - whether the claimant is entitled to any remedy

Ms Langley's relationship with a man with whom she had been living together broke down. He left the home that they had formerly shared but she remained. She agreed to pay rent to him and claimed housing benefit in respect of this. The local authority refused the claim in accordance with regulation 7(1)(c)(i) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 because she was paying rent to a former partner. She appealed against this decision on the grounds that it constituted discrimination incompatible with her Convention rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 because the definition of ""partner"" in those regulations only referred to heterosexual relationships, so that a person who had formerly been in a homosexual relationship and whose circumstances were otherwise the same as hers would have qualified for benefit. 

Her appeal was refused by the tribunal and she appealed to a Commissioner. He held that the facts fell within the ambit of Schedule 1 Part 1, Articles 8 and 14, to the Human Rights Act but the difference in treatment of which Ms Langley complained was justified. It was possible to speculate that the policy-makers responsible for regulation 7(1)(c)(i) had considered that there was less risk of abuse of the housing benefit scheme by former homosexual partners than by former heterosexual partners. He therefore rejected the appeal and Ms Langley appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary of State submitted a respondent's notice contending that the Commissioner was wrong to consider that either Article 8 or 14 was engaged.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	The facts did not fall within the ambit of Article 8. (Per Sedley LJ) the housing benefit scheme as a whole is within the ambit of Article 8 as its purpose is to enable persons to retain a dwelling that they would otherwise be unable to afford and so demonstrates the state's respect for the home. However it was necessary to consider not the scheme as a whole but the particular provision that was alleged to be discriminatory. Since the purpose of regulation 7(1)(c)(i) is to prevent abuse, it does not engage any Convention right (paragraphs 71 and 76). (Per Kennedy LJ) the housing benefit scheme is not within the ambit of Article 8 as its provision is not the state's demonstrating its respect for the home. Although it might have the effect in particular cases of enabling the claimant to retain a dwelling, the benefit was not sufficiently closely allied to that object (Douglas v North Tyneside MBC [2003] EWCA Civ 1847 [2004] HLR 14 considered) 
(paragraphs 179 to 180);

2.	The discriminatory effects of regulation 7(1)(c)(i) could not be justified. Even if it were the case (which was merely speculation on the part of the Commissioner) that the reason for the discrimination was that it was believed that the problem of artificial tenancies was far less prevalent as between former homosexual partners than as between former heterosexual partners, evidence that this belief was factually based needed to be presented. No such evidence had been before the Commissioner or the Court (paragraphs 68 and 69);

3.	Even if the refusal of benefit was incompatible with Ms Langley's Convention rights, no relief should be given by the Court. (Per Sedley LJ), she had failed to show that she was a 'victim' as required by section 7(1) of the Human Rights Act. Even if the discriminatory element in regulation 7(1)(c)(i) were removed by making it applicable to former homosexual couples, her own position would not be improved. Her real complaint was against the arbitrary nature of the provision but that does not raise any Convention issue (paragraph 75). (Per Neuberger LJ) the real anomaly in regulation 7(1)(c)(i) was that it did not cover former homosexual couples. Therefore for the Court to award compensation for breach of Convention rights to former heterosexual couples would be to increase the size of those to whom anomalous payments were being made, which the Court should not do (R (Hooper) v Secretary of State  for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ 813, [2003] 1 WLR 2623 at [160] to [163] applied) (paragraphs 179 to 180);

4.	Per Sedley LJ, if any remedy were to be given to Ms Langley, it would have to take the form of a declaration that regulation 7(1)(c)(i) was ultra vires. The alternative of ""reading up"" the regulation so as to construe it as covering former homosexual partners was not available as this would be to go beyond any power which even the Administrative Court possesses (paragraph 92).

A decision-maker decided, pursuant to regulation 51(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, that the claimant had intentionally deprived himself of £12,125.25 for the purposes of securing entitlement to income support and should be treated as having capital of that amount.  That decision was upheld by an appeal tribunal (""the first tribunal"").  From 22 October 2002, the claimant made a further claim for income support.  He declared savings of £2,699.60.  A decision-maker found that the claimant still possessed notional capital from the purchase of the car, but that the amount should be treated as reduced to £7,897.25, pursuant to the diminishing notional capital rule in regulation 51A.  A tribunal (""the second tribunal"") upheld this decision.  The claimant's total notional and actual capital disentitled him from income support.

The claimant appealed on the grounds that the second tribunal erred by failing to take into account the effect of paragraph 10 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.

Held, allowing the appeal,

1.	where a claimant acquires a personal possession with the intention of reducing his capital to obtain income support, the value of that possession forms part of his actual capital (pursuant to paragraph 10 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987), which is valued under regulation 49(a) of those Regulations before the question of whether he has notional capital is considered (paragraphs 14-17);
2.	the difference in value, at the date of deprivation, between the market or surrender value of the possession (as calculated under regulation 49(a)) and the cost of its acquisition is then treated as notional capital: CIS/494/1990 followed (paragraph 18);	

3.	that notional capital figure does not increase when the value of the personal possession depreciates further: CIS/494/1990 not followed (paragraph 19);	

4.	the finding of the first tribunal that the claimant possessed notional capital does not bind future decision-makers and tribunals, as the effect of section 17(2) of the Social Security Act 1998 is that no finding of fact or other determination which forms part of a decision on entitlement to benefit is conclusive for any other purpose (paragraph 11);
	
5.	had the first tribunal applied the law correctly, it would have found that the claimant was disentitled from income support because he had actual capital of at least £8,000, being the market value of the Vauxhall Zafira (paragraph 22); 	
6.	the diminishing notional capital rule in regulation 51(1A) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 could not therefore be applied to the further claim from 22 October 2002, because it was the claimant's actual (not notional) capital which had disentitled him to income support on the 4 April 2002 claim (paragraph 23);

7.	where regulation 51A cannot be applied, notional capital might in some circumstances be treated as reduced by the expenditure which a claimant would reasonably incur because of not being entitled to income support, although the claimant here could not benefit from this principle as this expenditure was already reflected in the reduction of his actual savings: CIS/3268/2002 followed (paragraph 24).

The claimant injured his leg in an accident and subsequently had a below knee amputation. The extent of the claimant's disablement was to be assessed in accordance with Schedule 6 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and regulation 11 of and Schedule 2 to the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982. The issue was how the stump left by the amputation should be measured for that purpose. The medically qualified member of the tribunal measured the stump at 14.5 centimetres for which the prescribed assessment is 40%. After the tribunal had given its decision the claimant's GP measured the stump at 12 centimetres. The claimant appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the legislation provides for the assessment of the loss of function consequent on the anatomical loss, not the anatomical loss alone. In this context disablement depends on the effectiveness of any prosthesis (paragraph 12);

2.         Schedule 2 provides a tariff for amputation stumps of different lengths as a starting point for assessment subject to increase or reduction in accordance with regulation 11(6) (paragraph 23);

3.	a lower leg amputation should be measured with the knee flexed from the anterior medial  edge of the upper articular surface of the tibia (paragraph 25).

M was the non-resident parent of two children. She was living with a same-sex partner. Her liability for child support maintenance was assessed in accordance with the rules in force at the time, which had the effect that she was required to pay more than would be required of a parent living as a member of a heterosexual couple in the same circumstances. She appealed, arguing that she had been unlawfully discriminated against by virtue of her sexual orientation, basing her claim on Article 8 of, and Article 1 of the First Protocol to, the European Convention on Human Rights, taken together with Article 14. The appeal tribunal agreed with M, relying on section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 to read the statutory definition of “unmarried couple” in the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations (the Regulations) to include a same-sex couple. The Child Support Commissioner dismissed the Secretary of State’s appeal, but on the basis that the qualifying words “unless the context otherwise provides” in the statutory definition permitted a non-discriminatory reading based on section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
In a combined judgment with Langley v Bradford Metropolitan District Council and another [2004] EWCA Civ 1343 (reported as R(H) 6/05), the majority of the Court of Appeal (Kennedy LJ dissenting) dismissed the Secretary of State’s appeal. Sedley LJ agreed with the Commissioner that the different level of respect accorded by the child support legislation to M’s family life with her new same-sex partner (as against a heterosexual relationship) came within the ambit of Article 8 and engaged Article 14. However, the remedy was to invoke section 3 of the 1998 Act to disapply the definition of “unmarried couple” in the Regulations. Neuberger LJ agreed, but also found that the scheme fell within the scope of Article 1 of the First Protocol. The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords.
Held, allowing the appeal (Baroness Hale dissenting), that:
1.	the rules governing the calculation of child support liabilities were altogether remote from the mischief at which Article 1 of the First Protocol was directed, since the child support scheme is not concerned with expropriating property but rather with enforcing the personal obligation of non-resident parents to support their children (paragraphs 5, 33, 90 and 159);
2.	(per Lord Bingham, Lord Walker and Baroness Hale) M’s relationship with her same-sex partner was capable of constituting “family life” within Article 8 (paragraphs 5, 87 and 112); however (per Lord Walker and Lord Bingham) M’s complaint did not fall within the ambit of Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14 because the child support assessment had no more than a tenuous link with respect for family life (paragraphs 5 and 87); 
3.	(per Lord Nicholls and Lord Mance) while in principle the child support regime fell within the ambit of Article 8 (paragraphs 19 and 127), established Strasbourg jurisprudence (the most recent case being Estevez v Spain, Application no 56501/00, 10 May 2001) did not yet recognise that the Convention guarantee of respect for family life was applicable to same-sex relationships (paragraphs 27 and 151);
4.	the link with respect for M’s private life was also a tenuous one and did not come within the scope of Article 8 since there had been no improper intrusion into her private life (paragraphs 5, 31 to 32, 88 and 157);
5.	(obiter) even if the child support regime were, in the respect complained of, within the ambit of a Convention right, the difference in treatment under the pre-amendment scheme was justified as the Regulations of which M complained represented the accepted values of society at the time of the assessment (2001/2002), and the United Kingdom had acted with reasonable promptness and within its margin of appreciation in introducing the complex legislation necessary to enable the Regulations to be amended (paragraphs 6, 34, 96 and 153 to 156).

The appellant non-resident parent was a self-employed trader. In September 2001 the Child Support Agency assessed his liability for child support maintenance for his children based on income shown in his tax return for 1999/2000 after a deduction for substantial capital allowances. The parent with care appealed and the tribunal substituted an assessment based on his 2000/01 tax return, also calculated after a deduction for substantial capital allowances. The parent with care appealed to the Child Support Commissioner, who allowed her appeal, holding that the words “total taxable profits” in paragraph 2A, introduced into Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 in 1999, referred to the figure before deduction of capital allowances. 
The non-resident parent appealed to the Court of Appeal with the support of the Secretary of State. The Court of Appeal held that “total taxable profits” referred to the figure to be entered in the tax return form next to those words, that being the figure after deduction of capital allowances. The parent with care appealed to the House of Lords. It was common ground that before the introduction of paragraph 2A there would have been no question of deducting capital allowances, and that that remained the case in specified circumstances where paragraph 3 continued to apply.
Held, allowing the appeal (Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry dissenting), that:
1.	“total taxable profits” was an ambiguous expression and its meaning could not be determined by applying the plain meaning test of statutory interpretation. It was therefore necessary to have resort to such aids as the mischief which the legislation was intended to meet, the legislative history and the consequences which would ensue from either construction (paragraphs 60 and 81);
2.	the deduction of capital allowances would be a significant change of substance and the changes to Schedule 1 were described as making administrative improvements, not changes of substance. There was no indication that Parliament had intended to change the principles by which self-employed earnings were calculated (paragraph 63, 70, 74 and 82);
3.	there was no rational reason why capital allowances should not be deductible where paragraph 3 applied but should be deductible in cases covered by paragraph 2A (paragraph 69);
4.	to attach great weight to the coincidence of the use of the words “total taxable profits” in paragraph 2A and the self-assessment tax return was over-literal and not in line with the modern approach to statutory construction (paragraphs 63, 89);
5.	the possibility of the position being alleviated by a departure direction was too speculative to be given any weight as an argument on construction (paragraphs 19, 64 and 85);
6.	(per Baroness Hale) when two interpretations of these regulations were possible, the interpretation chosen should be that which better complied with the commitment to the welfare of 
children which the United Kingdom had made by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (paragraph 78).

In each of these cases housing benefit paid direct to the claimant's landlord turned out to have been overpaid, and the local authority determined that the overpayment was recoverable from the landlord under section 75 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It was not disputed that the overpayments lay within the authorities' recovery powers, but each landlord appealed to the tribunal contesting his liability to repay: in CH/5216/2001 and CH/3880/2002 on the ground that the authority's determination was procedurally defective for failure to specify reasons or rights of appeal, and in CH/841/2002 on the ground that it was unfair in the circumstances to seek recovery from the landlord rather than the claimant.  The procedural argument succeeded before the tribunal in CH/5216/2001, but in the other two cases the appeals were rejected and the landlord's liability for the overpayment confirmed. 

On appeal by the authority in CH/5216/2001, and by the landlords in the two other cases, questions arose about the scope of the statutory appeal rights against overpayment decisions in housing benefit cases under section 68 of and Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 in the light of the Court of Appeal's decision in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v. (1) Chiltern District Council and (2) Warden Housing Association 2003 [EWCA] Civ 508, R(H) 2/03: in particular the ability of landlords to appeal against an authority's choice to use its available statutory powers against them. The Secretary of State and the Child Poverty Action Group (representing the interests of claimants) were joined as additional respondents.

Held, allowing the authority's appeal in CH/5216/2001 and dismissing those in the other two cases, that:

1.	a person from whom overpaid benefit is determined to be recoverable under section 75 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 has a single right of appeal under paragraph 6(6) of Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 against the making of that determination.  The appeal is by way of a complete rehearing of the factual and legal basis for the determination itself: (paragraphs 32-36, 49-50);

2.	there is no separate right of appeal against any choice made by the local authority over whether to use its available powers under section 75.  In any appeal against a determination under paragraph 6(6) the appellant may challenge the choice to make such a determination against him, but only on judicial review grounds, viz. that the authority's decision to do so was unlawful (paragraphs 44 - 48, 49(2), 51); 

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v. (1) Chiltern District Council and (2) Warden Housing Association, supra, explained.

3.	a tribunal may confirm a determination or substitute its own on appeal under paragraph 6(6) notwithstanding procedural irregularities on the part of the authority, provided there has been no significant prejudice to the appellant still uncorrected by the appeal process itself (paragraphs 74 - 76); 

Haringey LBC  v. Awaritefe (1999) 32 HLR 517 applied. 

4.	the determinations were not invalid and the overpayments were recoverable from the landlords.

Human Rights - discrimination on grounds of sex under Article 14 - whether man between 60 and 65 more likely to be compelled to draw on personal pension scheme than a woman - whether comparator group in relatively similar situation exists 

The claimant applied for income support on 23.8.00, when he was 61. He was entitled to income under a personal pension scheme; however, he had not taken steps to draw this income, or to purchase an annuity with funds available from the scheme. He stated that he did not intend to do so before he was 65, as deferment would allow him to benefit from any growth in the fund in the interim and would give him the opportunity to make further payments into the scheme should he return to work before 65. If he drew his pension earlier the level of income would also be lower. The amount of income which the claimant had foregone was taken into account as notional income pursuant to regulation 42(2A) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987.  

The claimant appealed, contending that his right to an income under the personal pension scheme was a possession within Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights. By taking into account as notional income the income he had foregone, the Secretary of State was in breach of that Article, by obliging the claimant to exercise his rights under the pension scheme in a way which was disadvantageous to him. A tribunal dismissed his appeal and the claimant appealed to a Commissioner, where he argued that regulation 42(2A) indirectly discriminated against the claimant, pursuant to Article 14 of the Convention, on grounds of sex. As women could draw a retirement pension at 60, they were less likely than men to claim income support between the ages of 60 and 65. Men were therefore more likely to be compelled to draw on personal 
pension schemes in advance of reaching 65.

Held, allowing the appeal but substituting a decision to the like effect, that:

1.	although regulation 42(2A) requires entitlement to income from the personal pension scheme to be brought into account for income support purposes, it does not interfere with any benefits to the claimant under that scheme and does not breach any rights under Article 1 of Protocol 1 which he has in respect of it (paragraph 8);

2.	income support is not itself a possession within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1 and Article 8 is not engaged on the facts of this case: Carson and Reynolds v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] 3 All ER 577 followed (paragraph 10);

3.	even were a substantive article to be engaged for the purposes of Article 14, women who are not in receipt of income support because they receive a retirement pension are not in a ""relevantly similar situation"" to men receiving income support, and do not provide a sufficient basis for comparison on which to establish discrimination (paragraph 11);

4.	however, the tribunal gave inadequate reasons for rejecting the claimant's human rights arguments (paragraph 14).",1,146,144,,

Compensation recovery - cause of payments of benefits - attribution where there have been two separate accidents

Compensation recovery - scope of appeal - deduction from compensation by compensator

The claimant worked for a removal firm, and on 1 April 1997 suffered an injury to his chest when lifting a heavy box. Eventually he left that employment, no longer being able to cope with the heavy lifting it occasioned. In October 1998 he started another job, but in early 1999 he suffered a further accident at work which severely affected his buttock and hip. He did not work again. Thereafter, in August 1999, the claimant claimed incapacity benefit (additional to the disablement benefit which he had previously been awarded following the 1997 accident). An ""all work test"" assessment took place in October 1999 at which the total number of points awarded was sufficient to entitle the claimant to incapacity benefit but the points attributable to each accident taken alone would not have entitled the claimant to benefit. At a further assessment in December 2000, the highest single number of points was awarded in respect of a disability arising from the chest injury sustained in the first accident and the claimant would have been entitled to benefit on the basis of those points alone. In March 2001 the claimant obtained judgment in his favour in his action for damages against his employers at the time of the first accident. Special damages were assessed on the basis that the claimant had been more or less incapable of work for two years after the accident and that thereafter his earning capacity was reduced. The employers had obtained a certificate of recoverable benefits from the Secretary of State which included all the disablement pension and incapacity benefit paid to the claimant since the relevant accident on 1 April 1997 on the basis that it had been paid ""in respect of"" that accident for the purposes of section 1 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997. The employers, as the compensator, deducted the whole amount of the benefits listed in the certificate from the compensation paid to the claimant. The claimant appealed against the certificate on the ground that it was wrong for four years' worth of benefits to be deducted when the compensation had been assessed on the basis that he was incapable of work for only two years. However, the tribunal considered that the question for them was simply whether the benefits paid were paid in consequence of the accident on 1 April 1997 and they dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State conceded that the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether the incapacity benefit had been paid as a result of the 1999 accident, rather than ""in respect of"" the accident on 1 April 1997, and should not therefore have been included in the certificate of recoverable benefits.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:

1.	benefit could be paid ""in respect of"" only one of successive accidents and was not payable ""in respect of"" an accident if it would have been payable in respect of a previous accident even if the later accident had not occurred (paragraph 15);

2.	having regard to the points awarded at the ""all work test"" assessments, the claimant's incapacity for work in October 1999 was attributable to the 1999 accident but his incapacity for work must have become attributable to the accident on 1 April 1997 at some point between October 1999 and December 2000, that point being determined by the Commissioner as being 18 May 2000, and accordingly incapacity benefit paid before 18 May 2000 was not paid ""in respect of"" the accident on 1 April 1997 (paragraph 17);

3.	the question whether the compensator had been entitled to deduct from the compensation all the benefits listed in the certificate of recoverable benefits was not a matter within the jurisdiction of a tribunal by virtue of section 11(1) of the Act but, being solely a matter between the claimant and the compensator, was a matter within the jurisdiction of the court dealing with the claim brought by the claimant against the compensator and, if not considered by the trial judge, might be brought before the court in proceedings to enforce the judgment of the court (paragraphs 20 and 21);

4.	but, given that it was a matter of concern that many hopeless cases were brought before tribunals and Commissioners under the 1997 Act, it was not inappropriate for a Commissioner to express a view on that question in the hope that the flow of hopeless appeals might be stemmed (paragraph 22);

5.	(obiter dicta) benefits could properly be deducted under section 8(3) from compensation only to the extent that they were paid during a period in respect of which relevant special damages had been recovered by the claimant (paragraph 32).",1,72,73,,

The claimant, who is severely disabled, was the sole proprietor of a property, 12 Carvers Lane. By deed dated 17 January 1997, he transferred his beneficial interest in the property to the Nay Housing Care Trust, of which he and his mother were the trustees. The property was let to third parties. By further deed, dated 20 October 2001, the claimant retired (and was replaced) as a trustee. The claimant had by then himself moved into the property. On 4 April 2002, the legal estate was transferred by the claimant to the trustees of the Nay Trust. The transfer was registered at the Land Registry on  8 April 2002.

 On 2 November 2001, the claimant had applied for housing benefit as a tenant of the Nay Trust. His claim was refused. A ground of refusal was that benefit was not payable in respect of ""payments by an owner"", pursuant to regulation 10(2) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. An ""owner"" is defined in regulation 2(1) as ""the person who ... is for the time being entitled to dispose of the fee simple"". The claimant appealed. A tribunal allowed the appeal. It decided that, although owner of the legal title, the claimant had no beneficial interest in the property and was therefore not the ""owner"" within the meaning of regulation 10(2).  

The local authority appealed to a Commissioner, who allowed the appeal, holding that the claimant was the ""owner"", as that word is defined in regulation 2(1). The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the claimant was the owner of the property within the meaning of regulation 2(1): section 20(1) of the Land Registration Act 1925 makes it clear that the claimant was entitled to dispose of the fee simple up until the register at the Land Registry was rectified on 8.4.02 (paragraphs 36 to 37);

2.	it is not possible to construe ""owner"" in regulation 2(1) as meaning exclusively a beneficial owner (paragraph 37).",1,131,,,

An adult who suffered from severe learning disability had her property and affairs managed by the Court of Protection. A large capital fund representing money she inherited from her late father was held by the Court on her behalf. Her claim for income support was refused on the basis that she had capital over the prescribed limit. Her receiver conceded that the funds were held on a bare trust for the claimant whose beneficial interest in the fund formed part of her capital resources. However he argued that the value of the fund should be disregarded as negligible on the ground that the interest of an incapacitated person in funds in Court is unmarketable and worth very little. A tribunal dismissed the appeal. On further appeal to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	assets being administered on behalf of a patient by the Court of Protection or by a receiver under the Mental Health Act remain the patient's own absolute beneficial property (paragraph.14); 

2.	assets so held are not to be regarded as having a reduced or negligible value by reason of the incapacity of the person they belong to or the administrative arrangements under which they are held (paragraph. 16);

3.	the fund in Court formed part of the claimant's capital within the Income Support (General) Regulations; there was no provision in Schedule 10 of those regulations for the fund to be excluded or disregarded and it should be taken into account at its current market value, valued in the normal way. (CIS/7127/95 followed, CIS/368/94 explained) (paragraph 19);

4.	since the size of the fund held for the claimant made it clear that her capital was far in excess of the capital limit, even with the most generous allowance for realisation costs including any application to the Court that would be needed, the claim had rightly been refused (paragraph 21).",1,29,,,

The claimant was in receipt of JSA on the basis that he was required to attend the Jobcentre and provide a signed declaration (""sign on"") fortnightly on a Friday. He ""signed on"" on 14 June 2002 but failed to do so on 28 June. On 9 July a decision was made that his ""claim was closed"" with effect from 15 June. On 12 July the claimant attended to ""sign on"" but was told that he must make a fresh JSA claim. He completed a claim form and also a form JSA5 to request backdating of his claim. On that form he stated that he had simply forgotten to ""sign on"" on 28 June. He also included information on the form that was subsequently accepted as showing that he had continued to satisfy the conditions of entitlement to JSA throughout the period from 15 June until his new claim. The request for backdating was refused and benefit awarded on the fresh claim only from 12 July. The claimant appealed but the appeal was rejected by the tribunal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner who obtained submissions as to the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v. Ferguson [2003] EWCA Civ 536 (reported as R(JSA) 6/03).

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	any request for benefit in respect of a period between the termination of one award and a new claim should be treated as both a request for revision or supersession of the termination of the old award and a request for backdating of the new claim and, following CJSA/2327/2001, an appeal should be treated as both an appeal against the decision terminating the first award and as an appeal against the decision making the second award (paragraphs 5 and 6);

2.	the tribunal's decision that there were no grounds for backdating the new claim was plainly correct but the tribunal erred in law in failing to consider whether the previous award had been correctly terminated (paragraph 8);      

                                      
3.	where a claimant fails to ""sign on"" and does not show good cause within the five days permitted by regulation 27(1) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996, the award of JSA is terminated under regulations 25 and 26 on the earlier of either the day after the last day in respect of which the claimant has shown that he continued to be entitled to jobseeker's allowance or the date of the failure to ""sign on"", so that, where a claimant does not produce information or evidence showing entitlement to JSA since he last signed on, the award should be terminated from the day after he last ""signed on"" (paragraph 10);

4.	where, however, the claimant subsequently produces within the time allowed information or evidence showing continued entitlement to JSA until at least the date he failed to ""sign on"", the production of the new information or evidence is not a change of circumstances, but is the production of information or evidence as to the circumstances obtaining at the time of the decision to terminate the award, and the Secretary of State should revise that decision so as to make it effective from the date of the failure to ""sign on"" (paragraphs 11 and 16 to 18).
The Commissioner substituted a decision that the claimant's previous award fell to be terminated from 28 June 2002, i.e. the date on which he failed to ""sign on"". Therefore the claimant was entitled to JSA for the period from 15 June to 27 June but not entitled for the period from 28 June to 11 July.",1,210,,,

Moyna [2003] UKHL 44,,"Disability living allowance - care component - inability to prepare a cooked main meal - whether inability on 1-3 days a week satisfies test - whether tribunals can properly reach different conclusions on the same facts - whether the meaning of words used in legislation was a question of law

The claimant had a heart condition which prevented her from exerting herself for any length of time, but she could on most days prepare a cooked main meal for herself. Her claim for disability living allowance was refused. She appealed to a tribunal, which decided that she did not satisfy the ""cooking test"" in section 72(a)(ii) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act. On further appeal a Commissioner found no error of law in the tribunal's decision, holding that while not all tribunals might have reached the same conclusion, the tribunal was entitled on the evidence to reach the conclusion it did.

The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal. It held that the provision of a cooked main meal was required on a regular basis to ensure a reasonable quality of life. If there was a clear pattern of a person not being able to provide for himself, the test would be satisfied. The Court rejected the view that different tribunals could on the same facts properly reach different conclusions as to whether the cooking test was satisfied.

Held by the House of Lords, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the cooking test was a notional test of severity of disability and the Court of Appeal was wrong to lay such emphasis on the need for a cooked main meal more or less every day to ensure a reasonable quality of life (paragraph 17);

2.	the test did not function at a day to day level, but required a broad view over the period throughout which it was to be satisfied. It was an exercise of judgment rather than an arithmetical calculation of frequency (paragraphs 18-19);

3.	where a tribunal had to apply a standard with a greater or lesser degree of imprecision and to take a number of factors into account, there were bound to be cases where a reviewing court could not say that the tribunal had erred in law in deciding the case either way (paragraph 20);

4.	the question whether the facts fell on one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is itself a question of fact, and will raise a question of law only if the decision of the fact-finding tribunal falls outside the bounds of reason (paragraphs 25-27).

Their Lordships restored the decision of the tribunal.",1,97,,,

This headnote is confined to a brief statement of the primary issues identified by the Tribunal and its conclusions on the major issues. A comprehensive summary by the Tribunal of its conclusions on all the issues before it is contained in paragraphs 186 to 198 of the decision. The primary issues as identified by the Tribunal were as follows. 
Issue 1: The general powers of an appeal tribunal on an appeal from a decision on revision (under section 9 of the Social Security Act 1998 (""the Act"") and regulation 3 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/991) (""the 1999 Regulations"") or supersession (under section 10 of the Act and regulations 6 and 9 of the Regulations) which contains two interlinked sub-issues, Issue 1A: the extent, if any, to which an appeal tribunal hearing an appeal against a decision which has been revised, or not revised following a claimant's application for revision, may substitute a decision to supersede or to refuse to supersede or vice versa; and Issue 1B: the extent, if any, to which an appeal tribunal can remedy defects in a decision which (if valid) has the effect of revising or superseding a decision.

Issue 2: The powers of an appeal tribunal to make a decision less favourable to a claimant than a supersession decision under appeal.  

Issue 3: The nature of the power in regulation 13C(3) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (SI 1987/1968, as amended) to revise an award on a renewal claim made in advance of the renewal date if the claimant is found not to satisfy the conditions of entitlement on the renewal date.

Held, dismissing the appeal in CIB/4751/2002 and allowing the appeals in CDLA/4753/2002, CDLA/4939/2002, and CDLA/5141/2002, inter alia, that:

1A	on an appeal against a decision superseding or refusing to supersede the tribunal has jurisdiction to make a revising decision, and likewise on an appeal against a decision which has been revised, or not revised following a claimant's application for revision, has jurisdiction to make a superseding decision. In the latter case, however, the tribunal can only take into account circumstances down to the date of the original decision (paragraphs 55 and 191);

1B	whilst there may be decisions which have so little coherence or connection to legal powers that they do not amount to decisions under sections 9 or 10 of the Act at all (and a decision however defectively expressed should generally be regarded as made under section 9 if it alters the original decision as from the effective date of that decision and as made under section 10 if it alters it from some later date), if an appeal tribunal finds that a decision has been made under section 9 or 10 of the Act it has jurisdiction to make the decision which the Secretary of State should have made (thereby remedying any defects in the decision whether properly regarded as defects of form or substance) and should not simply set such a decision aside as invalid or ""inept"" (agreeing with the decision in CSIB/1266/2000 and disagreeing with that in CSIB/1268/2000) (paragraphs 72 to 80, and 192); 

2. 	an appeal tribunal is entitled to make a decision less favourable to the claimant, than the decision under appeal (paragraphs 88 to 197, and 194);

3. 	the power under regulation 13C(3) of the 1987 Regulations is not subject to a requirement that one of the grounds for revision in regulation 3 of the 1999 Regulations be established but in the usual case, where the issue concerns the condition of the claimant at the renewal date, is exercisable only on the ground that the claimant's condition at that date either has improved to a greater extent than, or has not deteriorated to the extent, anticipated by the decision-maker (paragraphs 106, 107, and 198).",1,254,256,,

The claimant had an award of higher rate mobility and middle rate care components until 22 April 2001. On renewal she was found not to be entitled to any component from 23 April 2001. She appealed and a tribunal on 6 June 2002 awarded her lowest rate care component for three years from 23 April 2001. The claimant wrote a letter which the decision-maker treated as an application for supersession of the tribunal decision and on 30 July 2002 he gave a decision expressed as a supersession but making an award in the same terms as the tribunal. The claimant appealed. The claimant had also appealed to the Commissioner against the tribunal decision. A Commissioner allowed her appeal, set aside the tribunal award and remitted the case to a fresh tribunal. On 9 June 2003 a tribunal heard both appeals. They dismissed the appeal against the supersession decision finding no change of circumstances since the tribunal decision dated 6 June 2002 and that the decision had not been based on a mistake of fact. On the remitted appeal they made an award at the same rate for the same period.

On a further appeal, the Commissioner considered the question of what happens to an appeal against a supersession decision when the decision superseded (or not superseded) has been set aside on appeal by a tribunal or Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	an application for supersession resulting in a refusal to supersede does not terminate the period under consideration on an appeal against the original decision;

2.	live proceedings arising out of an application for supersession based on ignorance of or mistake as to a material fact lapse when the decision to be superseded is set aside on appeal;

3.	however live proceedings where the application is based on change of circumstances do not lapse when the decision to be superseded is set aside on appeal;

In her claim form she stated that her tenancy had been granted by her brother-in-law and that it had begun on 15 February 2001, although she had actually resided at the property since 1999. The tenancy agreement provided for a weekly rent of £110, and, on 1 June 2001, housing benefit of £60 per week was awarded. On 2 July 2001 the new system of decision-making and appeals in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit contained in Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (""the 2000 Act"") came into force. On 27 July 2001 the claimant was interviewed by an officer of the local authority. The claimant stated she had originally moved into the property with her husband in 1999, that he had at that time told her that he owned the property, and that they had paid no rent. However, her husband had left the country in February 1999 and she did not know if he would return. Following her husband's departure, her brother-in-law had told her that she would have to start paying rent and she now believed him to be the owner of the property. She paid him £240 per month and did not make up the difference between this and the stated rent in the tenancy agreement. She did not have a rent book nor did she receive any sort of receipt for the payments she made. A decision was taken on the same day to terminate the claimant's entitlement to benefit with effect from 7 May 2001. The claimant appealed against the removal of her award. A tribunal disallowed the claimant's appeal. It found that the claimant was not entitled to housing benefit from 7 May 2001 because the tenancy was not commercial. Moreover, the tribunal found further that regulation 7(1)(h) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (""the 1987 Regulations"") applied, to the effect that the claimant could not be treated as liable to pay since her husband had previously owned the dwelling within five years of the claimant's claim. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner who held an oral hearing. Before the Commissioner the question arose as to whether from 2 July 2001 onwards there was a power in Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act to revise determinations made by local authorities before that date given that paragraph 3(1) of the Schedule specifically referred to the revision of a ""decision"". It was accepted that prior to the introduction of the new adjudication scheme, the term ""decision"" referred only to a conclusion reached by a Review Board on appeal, the term ""determination"" having been used for the initial outcome produced by the local authority on the claim. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	although the primary purpose of Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act was to set out the new adjudication framework with effect from 2 July 2001, it was essential to any scheme of benefit adjudication that there should be a mechanism to take account of changes of circumstances and of conclusions having been reached on a mistaken or too limited a view of the existing circumstances; and it must have been intended by the legislature that the provisions in and under Schedule 7 were to form at least a reasonably workable scheme (see paragraph 50 of the decision of the Tribunal of Commissioners in CIB/4751/2002, CDLA/4753/2002, CDLA/4939/2002 and CDLA/5141/2002 (now reported as R(IB) 2/04)) (paragraph. 20);

2.	in relation to decisions of Review Boards made before 2 July 2001, the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) (Transitional and Savings) Regulations 2001 did provide for those decisions to be treated as decisions of appeal tribunals under paragraph 6 of Schedule 7 so as to bring those decisions within the power in paragraph 4 of the Schedule to supersede decisions of either an appeal tribunal or a Commissioner (paragraph 21);

3.	the definition of ""relevant decision"" in paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 7 is not expressly restricted to decisions of local authorities under Schedule 7, and this faint indication was sufficient in the overall context (explained above) to find that that definition was intended to include housing benefit and council tax benefit ""decisions"" made by the local authorities before 2 July 2001, and that the word ""decision"" was intended to include both decisions made by local authorities on or after 2 July 2001 and determinations made before that date (paragraph 21);

4.	on the present facts therefore the local authority did on 27 July 2001 have the power to revise its determination of 1 June 2001; however, the tribunal had erred in law by failing to inquire as to whether the local authority had proved that a ground of revision existed or whether it should exercise the discretion in paragraph 6(9)(a) of Schedule 7 to consider the issue even though it had not been expressly raised by the parties (paragraphs 22 and 26);

5.	in relation to the application of regulation 7(1)(h) of the 1987 Regulations  the relevant ""partner"" was the person who was the claimant's partner between the date of the claim and the date the determination was given (paragraph 31);

6.	moreover, having regard to the definition of the term ""married couple"" in regulation 2(1) of the 1987 Regulations, the claimant's husband would not be her partner once he ceased to be a member of the same household; the tribunal had therefore erred in its application of regulation 7(1)(h) to the facts of this case (paragraph 32);

7.	having regard to the application of regulation 7(1)(a) of the 1987 Regulations, the tribunal had been entitled on the evidence to conclude that the agreement was not on a commercial basis and it had applied the correct burden of proof; however, the tribunal had, by a narrow margin, failed to give adequate reasons for its decision (paragraphs 36 and 38).

The Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for determination.",1,254,131,,

Tribunal practice - jurisdiction - whether right of appeal against determination of amount recoverable under section 74 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992

The claimant was entitled to a small occupational pension when he reached retirement age in 1995, but owing to an oversight this was not paid until December 2000. The Secretary of State decided that there had been an overpayment of income support, which was recoverable from the arrears of occupational pension under section 74 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the occupational pension being ""prescribed income"" under regulation 7(1) of the Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988. A further overpayment was determined to be recoverable under section 71 of that Act in respect of income support paid after the payment of occupational pension had started but before the claimant informed the Secretary of State that it was being paid. The claimant appealed against both decisions, contesting that it was unfair that he should suffer a ""double deduction"", as the additional element in his state retirement pension was now reduced by an amount for guaranteed minimum pension (""GMP"") based on his contracted out contributions. At a combined hearing of both appeals a tribunal decided that the overpayment since December 2000 was recoverable under section 71 but that it had no jurisdiction in the appeal over the larger amount under section 74. The claimant was granted leave to appeal to a Commissioner on the jurisdiction issue in CIS/3451/2003. His application for leave in CIS/3378/2003 on the section 71 appeal was considered by the Commissioner as a linked appeal.
Held, dismissing the claimant's application for leave to appeal in CIS/3378/2003 and allowing the appeal in CIS/3451/2003, but substituting a decision confirming the Secretary of State's decision, that:
1.	the calculation of the overpayments did not involve a double deduction, as the means-testing calculation for income support was different from the way a GMP was allowed for in the state retirement pension itself, and the Secretary of State had applied the legislation correctly (paragraphs 5-10 and  15-20); 
2.	there is a right of appeal to a tribunal against a determination  under section 74(1) as it falls within section 12(1)(a) of the Social Security Act 1998 as ""a decision of the Secretary of State under section 8 ... made ... on an award of a relevant benefit"" (paragraph 22);
3.	it was clear that it was the claimant's delay in notifying the Secretary of State that he was  receiving his occupational pension that caused the overpayment in CIS/3378/2003 and there was therefore no ground for appeal (paragraphs 23-24);
5.	the Commissioner substituted his own decision in CIS/3451/2003 that the overpayment of income support was recoverable under section 74 (paragraph 24).",1,283,234,,

The claimant claimed disability living allowance and her claim was disallowed. She appealed to the tribunal seeking the middle rate of the care component and the lower rate of the mobility component. In relation to the mobility component she stated that she had last gone out alone some eighteen months previously, and that if she did walk outside then either her husband or daughter would accompany her and would ""talk to [her] all the time and encourage and reassure [her]"". The tribunal dismissed her appeal, finding in relation to mobility that being accompanied for the purpose of reassurance did not amount to needing someone for ""guidance or supervision"", as required to satisfy the conditions of section 73(1)(d) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The claimant applied for leave to appeal, and, in refusing that application, the chairman commented that regulation 12(7) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 would apply. Regulation 12(7) states that for the purposes of section 73(1)(d) ""a person who is able to walk is to be taken not to satisfy the condition of being so severely disabled physically or mentally that he cannot take advantage of the faculty out of doors without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time if he does not take advantage of the faculty in such circumstances because of fear and anxiety."" Regulation 12(8) provides inter alia that paragraph (7) shall not apply where the fear or anxiety is a symptom of mental disablement. The claimant further applied to the Commissioner who held an oral hearing of her application and granted leave to appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the fact that a claimant derives reassurance from a person is not conclusive one way or the other as to the question of whether the latter is also providing guidance or supervision (paragraph 6); 

2.	in the present case ""anxiety"" was one of the diagnoses of the claimant's conditions and in such circumstances regulation 12(8)(a) does not require that anxiety be a symptom of some other mental disorder (paragraph 8).

The Commissioner found on the facts that the claimant was entitled to the lower rate of the mobility component of disability living allowance.",1,90,,,

On 8 June 2001 the claimant gave birth to a baby. She enquired about a Sure Start Maternity Grant (""the Grant"") and was told this was only available if she was in receipt of a qualifying benefit, which included income support (IS). She claimed IS in August 2001 as a single person. Pending the result she claimed the Grant on 7 September 2001. This was refused on 13 September 2001 because she was not in receipt of a qualifying benefit. The claimant appealed to a tribunal.

On 6 September 2002 the tribunal confirmed the decision refusing the Grant. The claim for IS had been refused because the claimant and Mr W were living together as an unmarried couple. A memorandum to this effect was before the tribunal but not referred to in the statement. 

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Mr W had been in receipt of IS for some years. The Secretary of State had decided, and it was not disputed before the Commissioner, that Mr W and the claimant were an unmarried couple as from 30 June 2001

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the regulations provide for entitlement to a Grant when at the date of claim (for the Grant) the claimant has a partner to whom IS has been awarded. The question whether a claimant has a partner is intrinsic to the question of entitlement to the Grant and on an appeal against refusal which depends on the question of entitlement to a qualifying benefit a tribunal should always enquire whether the person applying for the Grant has a partner. The tribunal erred in law in failing to appreciate the significance of the memorandum and failing to make the relevant enquiries (paragraph 9);

2.	an argument that the regulation should be read as referring only to cases where the claimant's partner receives income support in respect of the claimant was rejected. (paragraphs 10 and 11).

The claimant appealed against a decision of the Secretary of State to award 7 points under the personal capability assessment for walking and negotiating stairs. The tribunal confirmed the 7 points and found that the claimant had had an involuntary episode of lost consciousness at least twice in the previous 6 months for which the score was 12 points, which was sufficient for the claimant to satisfy the test. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, on the ground that the tribunal had misdirected itself in law on the activity of remaining conscious.
The Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (""the 1995 Regulations"") had been amended with effect from 6 January 1997 by the Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996. The definition of the relevant activity in paragraph 14 had changed from ""remaining conscious other than for normal periods of sleep"" to ""remaining conscious without having epileptic or similar seizures during waking moments"". In Howker v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (reported as R(IB) 3/03) the Court had decided that the amendment to regulation 27(b) of the 1995 Regulations was invalidly made because the Social Security Advisory Committee had been misled as to its potential effect. All the proposed amendments had been described to the Committee as ""neutral"" in their potential effect, whereas in fact the amendment to regulation 27(b) was ""adverse"" to claimants. 

Held, dismissing the appeal that: 

1.	while the actual decision in Howker was limited to regulation 27(b) the reasoning on which the decision was based could be applied to other amendments (paragraph 6); 

2.	the effect of the amendment to paragraph 14 was adverse to claimants in its potential effect and the  Social Security Advisory Committee had been misled (paragraph 9);

3.	it followed that the amendment was of no force or effect and the claimant's incapacity for work had to be determined under the terms of paragraph 14 as originally enacted (paragraph 12);

4.	the other amendments to the 1995 Regulations were not at issue in this case and it was for tribunals to decide whether they were in fact ""neutral"" in their potential effect (paragraph 13);

5.	the tribunal had correctly applied the law to the evidence and its decision was correct (paragraph 17).",1,162,,,

The claimant, who lived alone, applied for an award of attendance allowance at the higher rate on the basis that he required supervision during the night as well as throughout the day in terms of section 63(3)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The tribunal, following R v. National Insurance Officer ex parte Secretary of State for Social Services [1974] 1 WLR 1092, held that the word ""night"" in section 63(3)(b) should be defined by reference to the habits of the particular household and not by reference to the period when the claimant was actually asleep. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the word ""night"" in section 64(3)(b) must have an objective content and not be restricted purely by the claimant's own sleep pattern (paragraph 8);

2.	by providing for separate periods of day and night supervision, the legislation must have envisaged that the 24 hour day would be divided into two reasonable parts on an objective basis having regard not only to the habits of the claimant but also to the expectations of those who were providing the care. 
Furthermore, section 64 refers to ""the day attendance condition"" and ""the night attendance condition"". The night attendance condition refers to ""another person to be awake ... for the purpose of watching over him"". It does not provide for watching over the claimant while he is asleep so the night condition would apply irrespective of whether the claimant is asleep or awake (paragraphs 9 to 11);

3.	in R v. National Insurance Officer ex parte Secretary of State for Social Services, ""night"" was held to be that period of inactivity through which each household goes in the dark hours, to be measured from the time at which the household ""closed down for the night"". In deciding what was day and what was night in a household, the Commissioner considered that regard must be had not only to what the claimant or household might do, but also to what a carer might be doing. Even if the claimant rose at 4.30am, it was likely that a carer, who required to get up from sleep, would consider that he or she was providing night care (paragraphs 12 and 14);

4.	although, in the instant case, the claimant lived alone and had abnormal sleeping habits, ""night"" required to be assessed objectively by reference to the hypothetical household, as if he had others living with him (paragraph 15).",1,94,,,

The claimant had been employed since 1996 by a university Students Union as an assistant in their shop on campus. She was only employed during term-time, which amounted to 31 weeks per year, working 25 hours per week. Her contract provided that she was entitled to 18 days' paid holiday per year, plus bank holidays (except Summer Bank Holiday) plus ""extra statutory"" public holidays as determined by the university. This had the effect that she was entitled to be paid for 12 days of public holidays, four of which fell within term-time. 
She made a claim for JSA on 17 June 2002 on the basis that she was unemployed due to the summer vacation. The Secretary of State disallowed the claim and she appealed. The tribunal made a finding that her contract of employment subsisted during the summer vacation but also commented that, if this was not so, as she expected to be re-employed at the start of the autumn term, she would be deemed for JSA purposes to be still employed during the vacation. 

As regards the calculation of the number of hours that the claimant worked per week, the tribunal held that there was a recognisable cycle of work consisting of a year. The tribunal stated that it has arrived at the weekly figure by taking the total number of hours worked during term-time and dividing it by 52 less the number of week's holiday to which the claimant was entitled. The tribunal did not explain the details of this calculation but held that the claimant was not entitled to JSA. She appealed to a Commissioner. The only issue in dispute in the Commissioner's proceedings was the calculation of the average number of hours worked per week.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal erred in law in failing to make sufficient findings of fact relating to the claimant's holiday entitlement, which was necessary in order to correctly calculate the average number of hours worked per week (paragraph 13);

2.	where a claimant had a recognisable cycle of work, a calculation had to be made to ascertain the average number of hours worked when the claimant was not on holiday or allowed to be absent due to sickness etc: R(JSA) 5/03 applied (paragraph 14); 

3.	to determine the dividend for the averaging calculation, it was necessary to deduct from the total number of working days in term-time any days of paid holiday that fell within term-time (paragraph 14); 

4.	to determine the divisor for the averaging calculation, it was necessary to deduct from the total number of weeks in the cycle, all days of holiday entitlement under the claimant's contract of employment (paragraph 22); 

5.	since there is no statutory or general entitlement to be paid for days declared to be public or bank holidays (Campbell & Smith Construction Group Ltd v. Greenwood [2001] IRLR 588 applied), as the claimant was entitled to be paid for those days, that entitlement must arise under her contract. Therefore those days fell to be included in the total to be deducted under point (4) above. The Commissioner found it unnecessary to decide if this principle applied to those public holidays that fell within term-time, as this could make no difference to the outcome of the present case (paragraph 22). 

The Commissioner set aside the tribunal decision and substituted his own. The dividend for the averaging calculation was 755 hours (775 total working hours in term-time less the 4 public holidays that fell within term-time). Even if those days were not taken into account when calculating the divisor, the claimant must be treated as having a holiday entitlement of 26 days (18 ordinary days plus 8 public holidays) which, on the basis of a 5 day working week, equated to 5.2 weeks. Therefore the divisor was 46.8, giving an average of 16.13 hours per week. On that basis, the claimant was not entitled to JSA.",1,235,,,

The absent parent in this case had bought three homes; the first, when he was 25, jointly with his brother; the second, after he married, jointly with the parent with care and his brother and the last, jointly with the parent with care. On each occasion he obtained an endowment mortgage to mature when he was about 50. When he and the parent with care divorced, she moved away with the children and he stayed in the former matrimonial home. The final order for ancillary relief recorded that the parties had agreed that the absent parent would re-mortgage the former matrimonial home. He was also required to transfer to the parent with care his interest in the endowment policies which secured payment of the then existing mortgage. The absent parent then chose to obtain a repayment mortgage, not for the usual 25 year term but for 12 years to mature about the same time as the previous endowment mortgages. This made the weekly payments higher than they would otherwise have been.

On an application for child support by the parent with care, she contended that in calculating the housing costs of the absent parent for the purposes of calculating his exempt income there should be an apportionment and that he should be credited only with the level of repayments he would have had to make under a 25 year term. 

Paragraph 4(1)(a) of Schedule 3 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 limits eligible housing costs to those ""necessarily incurred for the purpose of purchasing  ... the home of the parent and his family"". Paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 3 excludes from eligible housing costs ""any payments in excess of those required to be made under or in respect of the mortgage"". The Commissioner rejected an appeal by the parent with care against the allowance of the whole of the absent parent's mortgage repayments in his eligible housing costs, holding that although paragraph 4(1)(a) set a high threshold it must be interpreted and applied sensibly with appropriate regard to the realities of property acquisition and the mortgage market. In particular it was not appropriate to disallow all housing costs that were not absolutely essential. The parent with care appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	The test of necessity must be considered in a common sense and reasonable way. All the circumstances must be weighed in the overall exercise of a judgment as to whether costs are necessarily incurred: not only the purpose of the loan, but the terms and conditions including interest rate, term of the loan and level of periodical payments required and the circumstances of the person incurring the costs. However ""necessity"" requires some degree of compulsion or exigency and is not  a test of sensibleness or reasonableness: CCS/1707/2003 approved; CSC4/02-03 disapproved (paragraph 50); 

2.	The Commissioner had identified the correct legal test to be applied in deciding whether the absent parent's housing cost were necessarily incurred (paragraph 43);

3.	Although a different tribunal or Commissioner might have come to a different conclusion on the facts, the particular decision reached by the Commissioner in the exercise of his judgment fell within the bounds of reasonable judgement and was not one with which the Court would interfere (paragraph 46).",1,40,,,

The claimant was awarded income support from 24 November 1997 to 14 February 1998 and again from 16 February 1998 indefinitely. Although the claimant was liable to pay a service charge in respect of a communal boiler, this charge was not included in his housing costs although it qualified for inclusion. On 14 March 2002 the claimant asked for inclusion of the service charge in his award and for this to be backdated for 5 years. On 12 April 2002, the decision-maker superseded the current award so as to include the service charge with effect from 28 February 2002 but declined to revise the last awarding decision made on 20 February 1998 because he could not identify any ground for so doing. On appeal to the tribunal, the claimant argued that he had been misadvised by the Benefits Agency and that the awarding decisions could be revised on the ground of official error under regulation 3(5)(a) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (""the Regulations""). The tribunal dismissed the appeal but did not deal with the possibility of revision for official error in their reasons for the decision. The tribunal did accept that the claimant had been misadvised. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, contending that the absence of a right of appeal in the event of a refusal of an application, made more than 13 months after the original decision, for revision of that decision on the ground of official error would be in breach of Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The case was directed to be set down for hearing before a Tribunal of Commissioners under section 16(7) of the Social Security Act 1998 (""the 1998 Act"") as involving questions of law of special difficulty.  

Held, allowing the appeal to the extent only of setting aside the tribunal's decision and substituting a decision to very similar effect, that:

1.	a decision under section 9 of the 1998 Act to revise or not to revise it is not itself appealable under the 1998 Act; the only decision which can be appealed is the original decision as either revised or not revised; regulation 31(2) of the Regulations did not extend the time for appealing against the original decision in the case of a decision not to revise for official error (paragraph 17);

2.	a decision of the Secretary of State whether to revise for official error does involve a determination of the claimant's civil rights for the purpose of Article 6 of the Convention because as a matter of construction of section 9(1) of the 1998 Act and regulation 3(5)(a) of the Regulations, the claimant was entitled to apply for revision on the ground of official error and entitled to have the original decision revised if, owing to an official error, that decision was less favourable to him than it should have been;  the Secretary of State did not have a discretion to revise or not to revise for official error; although the claimant's ""civil right"" for the purpose of Article 6 was the right (if he had one) to the social security benefit which was the subject of the original decision on his claim, the provisions permitting decisions to be revised should be regarded as part of the process whereby a claimant's entitlement to social security benefits was determined and therefore within the scope of Article 6, even  in circumstances in which the claimant had the opportunity of an appeal in satisfaction of his Article 6 rights in relation to the original decision; a decision by a decision-maker was not one of a merely administrative nature (paragraph 39 of R(IS) 6/04 followed) (paragraphs 37 to 49);

3.	the absence of a right of appeal to an appeal tribunal against a decision refusing to revise for official error (where that decision is made more than 13 months after the date of the original decision) did not involve a breach of Article 6; the right to a full rehearing on appeal against the original decision and the ability to apply for judicial review of a decision not to revise for official error rendered the procedure as a whole compliant with Article 6 (paragraphs 50 to 54);

4.	there is no discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 against someone in the position of the claimant (seeking revision for official error, in a social security context) compared with someone seeking revision on a similar ground in a housing benefit context; neither category of person has a right of appeal against a refusal of an application to revise for official error made more than 13 months after the original decision; regulation 18(3)(b) of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 refers to an application for revision for which regulation 4 itself of those regulations makes express provision, that is to say to an application under regulation 4(1) (paragraphs 65 to 73);

5.	in the circumstances of this case where the tribunal was dealing with an appeal against a supersession decision and there had been an express refusal by the Secretary of State to revise the original decision which was not capable of being appealed  and was ""final"" by section 17 of the 1998 Act,  the tribunal could not itself on appeal, substitute a revision decision for the supersession decision   (aragraph 55, under Issue 1A, of  R(IB) 2/04 considered) (paragraphs 77 to 78)

6.	 the tribunal erred in law (a) by failing in its statement of reasons to 
deal expressly with the question whether there was before it an appeal against the decision of 12 April 2002 refusing to revise for official error the decision of 20 February 1998 and (b) because the correct ground for supersession was not a change of circumstances as identified by the decision-maker but ignorance of a material fact, namely payment of the service charge and (c) the supersession decision should have taken effect from 14 March 2002, the date of application for the supersession (see the primary rule in section 10(5) of the 1998 Act which was not varied by any of the provisions of regulation 7 of the regulations) (paragraphs 79 to 81).

The Tribunal of Commissioners substituted its own decision that the decision made on 20 February 1998 was to be superseded  with effect from 14 March 2002 by  taking the service charge into account.",1,138,255,,

The claimant, aged 57, claimed widow's benefit on 5 September 2000 under sections 36 to 38 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 in respect of her long-term partner who died on 4 February 2000. The claimant and her partner had discussed marriage but decided against it, regarding it as unnecessary as they were committed to one another without it. The condition of entitlement to widow's benefit was that the claimant must be ""a woman who has been widowed"". The claim was refused on 7 September 2000 as it had not been established nor could it be presumed that she and her partner had ever been married, so she could not be his widow. The claimant appealed, arguing that she could still qualify by a presumption of marriage through long cohabitation, or alternatively, that by virtue of the European Convention on Human Rights (""the Convention""), entitlement to a widow's pension should be extended to longstanding unmarried partners. On 4 November 2002, the tribunal dismissed her appeal, deciding that any presumption of lawful marriage from long cohabitation as analysed in R(G) 1/00 Chief Adjudication Officer v. Bath had been rebutted by compelling evidence that the parties had never been married and had made up their minds not to do so. It was impossible to construe the widow's benefit provisions in a way which included the claimant. Leave to appeal was granted by the tribunal chairman. The presumption aspect was not pursued before the Commissioner. Instead, it was argued that the tribunal erred by holding that it was impossible as a term of statutory construction to construe  ""widow"" to include the claimant even after accepting that the Human Rights Act 1998 (""the HRA"") required them to do so. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	as the original decision rejecting her claim was made prior to commencement of the HRA, the tribunal were restricted by section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 to the state of the facts and United Kingdom law in force when that decision was given for the reasons explained in CDLA/1338/2002 and in accordance with the decision of the House of Lords in Wilson v. First County Trust (No. 2) [2003] UKHL 40, [2003] 3 WLR 568 and was not required or empowered by section 3 of the HRA to alter the interpretation of sections 36 to 38 in order to create an entitlement that did not otherwise exist (paragraph 13);

2.	even if the appeal had not failed on that ground, the arguments on the effect of the HRA would be rejected for the same reasons as given in an unreported Commissioner's decision CG/1259/2002. In that decision, it was held that references in sections 36, 37 and 38 of the 1992 Act to a ""woman who has been widowed"" and to that woman's ""late husband"" required there to have been a marriage, actual or presumed, between the claimant and her late partner and that no other reading was possible. This was primary legislation and there was no power to make a declaration of incompatibility at this level under section 4. Moreover assuming, without deciding, that Article 1 of Protocol 1 or Article 8 of the Convention were engaged, the difference in treatment between married and unmarried couples could not be accepted as unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14.

The claimant had suffered serious multiple injuries in an accident. His remaining disabilities included a painful claw foot. He was refused higher rate of mobility component. An examining medical officer reported that on a good day the claimant would be able to walk 200 yards before the onset of severe discomfort and on a bad day a few yards. He would take 20 minutes to cover both those distances.
An appeal tribunal accepted that the claimant had a severe disablement which affected his mobility. However the majority dismissed his appeal on the basis that the level of pain he suffered did not increase when he walked and he therefore did not fall within the terms of regulation 12(1)(a)(ii) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	regulation 12(1)(a)(ii) requires that walking which cannot be accomplished without severe discomfort is to be disregarded (paragraph 9);

2.	although it is only discomfort related to the physical act of walking which is relevant to higher rate mobility component under regulation 12(1)(a)(ii), there is no requirement that such discomfort must first arise or must increase after walking has commenced (R(DLA)6/99 Hewitt v. Chief Adjudication Officer; Diment v. Chief Adjudication Officer CA, considered) (paragraph 7);

3.	if the tribunal were satisfied that the claimant suffered from a physical disablement which affected the physical act of walking and which caused the claimant severe discomfort even when not walking, any walking which the claimant was able to accomplish despite the discomfort was to be disregarded (paragraph 10).

The Commissioner considered the evidence, made fresh findings of fact and awarded the claimant higher rate mobility component.",1,91,,,

Prospective claim - whether Secretary of State entitled to disallow claim before renewal date

Regulation 13C of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 provides for renewal claims for disability living allowance to be made up to six months in advance of expiry of an existing award and to be treated as made on the renewal date subject to the condition that the claimant satisfies the requirements for entitlement on the renewal date. In the first two cases, the Secretary of State disallowed the claims.  A tribunal allowed an appeal in part in the first case and another tribunal dismissed an appeal in the second case.  On further appeals by the claimants, it was argued that the Secretary of State had not been entitled to disallow the claims before the renewal dates for the reasons given in C12/03-04(DLA).  It was also argued that the tribunals' reasoning on other issues in the two cases was inadequate.  In the third case the Secretary of State allowed the renewal claim prospectively but, on appeal, the tribunal had purportedly applied section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 by refusing to have regard to the actual condition of the claimant at the renewal date but taking into account those effects of a recent amputation that they considered could reasonably have been anticipated.  On appeal by the claimant, reliance was placed on CDLA/3848/2001, where the Commissioner had held that regulation 13C effectively created an exception to section 12(8)(b) because a decision made prospectively on a renewal claim required a prediction as to what the claimant's circumstances would be on the renewal date and the claim subsisted up to the renewal date. 

Held, allowing the first and third appeals and dismissing the second appeal, that:

1.	section 8(2)(a) of the 1998 Act, providing that that a claim ceases to subsist when the decision is made, applies in the case of a decision made prospectively just as it applies in any other case (paragraph 14);

2.	the express effect of section 8(2)(b) is to prevent the Secretary of State from taking account of an anticipated change of circumstances when making a prospective decision on a renewal claim, and consequently a tribunal is prohibited by section 12(8)(b) from taking account of any change of circumstances occurring between the date of decision and the renewal date so that the tribunal's decision in the third case was erroneous in point of law: CDLA/3848/2001 (and the suggestion in R(IB) 2/04 that a renewal claim requires prediction) should not be followed (paragraphs 13, 15, 18 and 36);

3.	the power to make an award and the power to disallow a claim are both implicit in the duty to decide a claim, imposed by the 1998 Act, and there is a further implied duty to determine a claim without undue delay (paragraphs 16 and 22) and, consequently, the Secretary of State has the power to disallow a renewal claim prospectively, although he may defer a decision where there are grounds for anticipating that there is likely to be a significant change of circumstances: C12/03-04(DLA) should not be followed (paragraphs 16, 22 to 26);

4.	The tribunal's decision in the first case was erroneous in point of law on other grounds but the tribunal's decision in the second case was not (paragraphs 30 and 33).",1,283,53,,

Incapacity - personal capability assessment - activity 13: continence - whether person wearing an ileostomy bag has ""no voluntary control over bowels""

The claimant suffered from Crohn's disease. He had an operation (ileostomy) to create an opening from his intestines through his abdomen to divert the flow of faecal waste into an externally fitted bag. Although a person would have no control over the flow of waste from his body into the bag after an ileostomy or a colostomy, it was possible to lead an otherwise normal life if the bag was efficient and the person had complete control over emptying it. The claimant emptied his bag every two hours and replaced it every second day. He completed a personal capability assessment questionnaire on 14 August 2002. On 27 January 2003, he was examined by a departmental doctor who awarded 3 points for the bending and kneeling descriptor but chose the descriptor ""No problem with continence"" in relation to the continence descriptor. On 13 February 2003, the original decision awarding incapacity benefit was superseded and benefit stopped as the claimant only had an aggregate score of 3 points.  The tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal on 14 May 2003. The claimant sought leave to appeal to the Commissioner on the ground that the tribunal had erred in the way that it had treated the continence descriptor. Leave to appeal was granted by the District Chairman. It was argued on behalf of the claimant that it was incumbent on the Commissioners to follow the obiter dicta of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Perry v. Adjudication Officer (reported as an appendix to R 8/99 (IB)) which considered the same point in the context of an identical statutory provision and concluded that a person fitted with a colostomy bag necessarily falls within descriptor 13 because he has no voluntary control over his bladder.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the extent to which obiter dicta should be followed depends on the circumstances in which the legal comment was made. As the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Perry had the benefit of full argument and made it clear that it was giving guidance on a potentially controversial point to prevent further unnecessary adjudications, its comments, albeit obiter, were hardly less persuasive upon Commissioners than the ratio of a Northern Ireland Court of Appeal decision. A Commissioner or a Tribunal of Commissioners should follow such dicta unless there were quite exceptional circumstances to the contrary (paragraph 30);

2.	An ileostomy bag played no part in assisting a person's control over the urge to expel waste from his body. Ileostomy and colostomy bags and incontinence pads mitigated the consequences of incontinence but did not affect a person's capacity to perform the activity in issue (paragraph 36). A person wearing an ileostomy or colostomy bag falls within descriptor 13(a) (paragraph 37);

3.	CIB/14210/1996 which concluded that a claimant who had his bladder removed and had a urostomy bag could not satisfy descriptors 13(b), (f) or (g) because he had no bladder to control, was wrongly decided. There was no rational basis for distinguishing between a case where the claimant has no bowel or bladder and where a claimant had a malfunctioning bladder or bowel.

The Tribunal set aside the decision of the appeal tribunal and substituted their own decision that the claimant was entitled to 15 points under descriptor 13(a).",1,161,,,

The claimant's husband was charged with offences against children and bailed with a condition of residence away from the matrimonial home. The claimant claimed income support. A decision-maker decided that she had not been ""abandoned"" by her husband for the purposes of paragraph 8(3)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, which provides for housing costs to be treated as ""existing housing costs"", to the advantage of the claimant, where a claimant has been abandoned by his or her partner. The claimant appealed. She told the tribunal that, had she found out before the police that her husband was committing offences against children, she would have excluded him from their home, or would herself have left with their children, because she would have feared for the safety of the children. The tribunal dismissed her appeal, relying on R(IS) 12/99 for the proposition that abandonment required a deliberate withdrawal by the spouse of his society and financial support from the claimant. Here the police had removed the need for her to leave or to force him to leave. Therefore there was neither an abandonment nor a constructive abandonment. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed her appeal, distinguishing R(IS) 12/99 and applying R(IS) 2/01, and holding that the husband's behaviour amounted to constructive desertion. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the term ""abandoned"" in paragraph 8(3)(b) is intended to bear the same meaning as ""deserted"" has in matrimonial law as between married couples and to cover cases of ""constructive abandonment"" (paragraph 19);

2.	imprisonment can constitute the necessary element of physical separation for abandonment as can a bail condition (disagreeing with the reasoning in R(IS) 12/99), but desertion in matrimonial law also requires an intent on the part of the deserting party to desert the other (paragraphs 20 and 21);

European Union Law - woman over the age of 60 not entitled to incapacity benefit - whether breach of Directive 79/7

The claimant was a woman who attained pensionable age when she reached 60 on 3 May 1997. She became entitled to a retirement pension at a reduced rate. From June 1997 she commenced working for about 30 hours a week. However, on 8 March 2001, when she was 63, she became incapable of work. She claimed incapacity benefit from 30 September 2001. Her claim was disallowed pursuant to section 30A Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, because she was over pensionable age when she became incapable of work and made her claim. It was also the case that she would not have satisfied the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit. As a woman over pensionable age, she was not able to pay contributions in the three relevant tax years, despite receiving an income upon which a man under 65 would have been liable for contributions.

The claimant appealed. She argued that a man in her position would have been entitled to incapacity benefit by reason of his age and would also have paid contributions compulsorily sufficient to establish that entitlement. The refusal of her claim was thus discriminatory on grounds of sex and contrary to EC Directive 79/7. An appeal tribunal dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.

The Commissioner gave a direction staying the appeal, on the grounds that:

1.	the ruling of the European Court of Justice in Secretary of State for Social Security v. Graham (reported as R(S) 2/95) referred only to women who became incapable of work before reaching pensionable age but was predicated on the unchallenged assumption that a woman over pensionable age was not able to pay the contributions necessary to give rise to entitlement to invalidity benefits and that that did not breach of Directive 79/7 as the relevant provisions fell within the derogation from the principle of equal treatment contained in article 7(1)(a) of the Directive (paragraphs 27-30);

2.	that assumption was now challenged in this appeal, on the basis that the derogation in Article 7(1)(a) does not allow for liability to contributions for benefits other than retirement pensions to be linked to pensionable age, where that link leads to a difference in treatment between men and women (paragraphs 33-38);

3.	it was not permissible to deem a woman to have paid contributions in circumstances in which a man must actually have paid them because that would place a woman in a more favourable position than a man (paragraph 39);

4.	the Commissioner had no power to make a ruling on the claimant's liability or entitlement to pay contributions, as the jurisdiction to make that decision lay with the Inland Revenue but, as the claimant had an arguable case, the appeal would be stayed to allow her the opportunity to take separate proceeding to enable her to pay the contributions she required (paragraphs 40-43);

The claimant's representatives subsequently notified the Commissioner that no such further proceedings were to be brought. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The tribunal were correct to hold that the claimant was not entitled to incapacity benefit from 30 September 2001, as she had not satisfied the relevant contribution conditions.",1,117,,,

Disablement benefit - prescribed disease A11 vibration white finger - diagnosis 

The claimant had made separate claims for disablement benefit (DB) for different prescribed diseases, which were refused, appealed and subsequently considered together on appeal by a tribunal. The two decisions of the tribunal were appealed to the Commissioner who gave this combined decision. (1) CI/5270/2002 was for A12 carpal tunnel syndrome; (2) CI/5271/2002 for A11 vibration white finger.

(1)	The claim for DB for A12 was on 6 March 2002. It was rejected by the Secretary of State on 25 May 2002. The claimant appealed to a tribunal who on 22 August 2002 diagnosed A12 and found that the claimant was suffering a loss of faculty and disablement. The claimant had previously made a claim for the same disease in 2001 which had been disallowed by the Secretary of State on 10 January 2002 because he was not found to have ever had the disease. This decision was never appealed and so became conclusive for the purposes of the 2001 claim. The tribunal accepted a submission by the Secretary of State that because of this previous negative decision they were unable to determine a date of onset for the disease earlier than 11 January 2002. The issue was whether they were so restricted.

(2)	The same tribunal on 22 August 2002 confirmed the rejection of the claim for A11 because they considered his evidence of the ""evolution"" and extent of the whitening he said he suffered was not consistent with prescribed disease A11. The claimant challenged the tribunal's decision as based on insufficient evidence and claimed he could show it was factually incorrect as he had subsequently obtained a vascular surgeon's report.  Before the Commissioner the Secretary of State argued that questions of how blanching had been caused, and in particular whether this was by vibration, had to be addressed as part of the question of diagnosis of disease A11 because of the presence of the phrase ""(vibration white finger)"" in the prescription. 

Held, allowing the appeal on (1) and dismissing the appeal on (2) that:

Regulation 9(1)(b) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations provided that the care component would not be paid for any period  during which a claimant was living in accommodation the cost of which was borne wholly or partly by public or local funds in pursuance of an enactment relating to persons under disability.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The claimant had been in receipt of invalidity benefit and was entitled to an adult dependency increase (ADI) to that benefit in respect of his wife, which was preserved by the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) (Transitional) Regulations 1995 when invalidity benefit was converted into incapacity benefit. Regulation 24(7)(b) of those regulations provided that entitlement to the ADI would cease if it was not ""paid or payable"" for 57 continuous days. His wife was awarded incapacity benefit in her own right with the result that the ADI was suspended by virtue of the Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979 (""the Overlapping Benefits Regulations""), which provide that where a personal benefit exceeds a dependency benefit, the dependency benefit ""shall not be paid"". The award of incapacity benefit to the claimant's wife ceased after a period of more than 57 days and the claimant requested re-instatement of the ADI. Eventually a decision was made in August 2001 purporting to disallow his ""claim"" for an ADI. Two further decisions were made in October 2001, the first purporting to revise the decision of 7 August and the second effectively, though not expressly, superseding the award of ADI on the correct regulatory grounds. The claimant appealed and a tribunal, after considering conflicting Commissioners' decisions, decided that ADI remained payable while not actually in payment owing to the Overlapping Benefits Rules and that consequently the transitional protection was never lost. The Secretary of State appealed on the grounds that such a construction was erroneous. A Tribunal of Commissioners was convened to resolve the conflict of opinion.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the August 2001 decision was so fundamentally flawed as to be beyond the powers of the Tribunal of Commissioners to correct it (R(IB) 2/04 followed) and the decision purporting to revise it fell with it, but the second October decision took effect as a valid supersession decision and was the only decision before the appeal tribunal and the Tribunal of Commissioners (paragraphs 18 to 24);

2.	the natural reading of regulation 10(2) of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations, looked at on its own, was that, in providing that ADI shall not be paid, the regulation had the effect that it was not payable and the context of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations as a whole supported that conclusion. (paragraphs 40 to 41 and 46);

CIB/27/1997 followed in preference to CIB/14383/1996.

3.	the protection afforded by regulation 16 of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations to ""entitlement"" for purposes other than the right to payment did not extend to payability, even though most of those regulation affected the right to payment and not entitlement; the term ""entitled"" was a conventional reference to the potential effect of the Overlapping Benefits Regulations as a whole (paragraphs 42 to 45).",1,167,59,,

The claimants in the three appeals, and in others which had been deferred or stayed pending their outcome, were widowers who had claimed widow's benefit under the legislation in force until 9 April 2001. It had been conceded by the Secretary of State that that legislation (section 36 to 38 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992) was in breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights taken with Article 8, as it discriminated against men. It was contended before the Commissioner that, from its coming into force on 2 October 2000, the Human Rights Act 1998 required the Interpretation Act 1978 to be read in a way which permitted the language of sections 36 to 38 be interpreted in a gender neutral way, so as to permit men, as well as women, to claim widow's benefit. 

Held, dismissing the appeals, that:

1.	it was impossible to interpret sections 36 to 38 in a gender neutral way, as the legislation showed a clear contrary intention. The decision on that question in R (Hooper) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 813 [2003] 1 WLR 2623 was binding on the Commissioner (paragraph 11);

2.	in respect of those claims which were decided before 2 October 2000, the decision-maker was precluded from considering the effect of the Human Rights Act because its provisions were not a circumstance obtaining at the time of those decisions (paragraph 12);		

Wilson v. First County Trust Ltd referred to.

3.	it followed that no man who claimed widow's benefit in respect of a spouse who died before 9 April 2001 was entitled under British social security legislation to any payment of widow's benefit (paragraph 2).

The claimant requested a claim form for income support by telephone on 23 October 2002. The claim form was sent out with the instruction that benefit could be paid from 23 October 2002 if the form was returned fully and properly completed by 25 November 2002 (i.e. within the one-month period for completing a claim provided for by regulation 6(1A)(b) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (""the 1987 Regulations"")). The claimant returned the form by hand on 22 November 2002 indicating that he wished to claim income support from 12 October 2002, but the claim form was not accepted as properly completed and supported by evidence until 31 December 2002. The claim was therefore allowed only from 31 December 2002. 

The claimant appealed to a tribunal, arguing inter alia that the prescribed time for claiming should be extended by one month by virtue of regulation 19(6) of the 1987 Regulations because he could not reasonably have been expected to make the claim earlier as a result of adverse postal conditions over the Christmas period, that being one of the circumstances prescribed in regulation 19(7) of the 1987 Regulations. The tribunal accepted the Secretary of State's submission that the time for claiming could not be extended to cover the period from 12 October to 30 December 2002 and dismissed the claimant's appeal. On his appeal to the Commissioner, the main question was whether, because of the rule in regulation 19(6) that the time for claiming could only be extended by a maximum of one month, the claimant could gain any practical advantage even if regulation 19(6) and (7) did apply.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	it was clear from R(IS) 3/01 and CIS/849/1998 that the maximum period of extension under both regulation 19(4) (three-month extension in prescribed circumstances) and regulation 19(7) should  be calculated backwards from the date of actual claim, not forwards from the first day of the period expressly claimed for (paragraph 14);
	
2.	 in appropriate circumstances a claim could be taken as including a claim for a period starting with the earliest date which would make the claim in time (paragraph 15);

3.	the question of reasonableness should be considered in relation to each separate potential period of claim prior to the date of actual claim, and so an unjustified failure to make a claim before the beginning of a period of claim should not prevent the operation of regulation 19(4) or 19(6);

4.	it followed that the appeal tribunal erred in law by failing to explain why the claimant's case on adverse postal conditions did not succeed (paragraph 20).

The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the claim made on 31 December 2002 was in time for the period beginning on 14 December 2002.",1,57,55,,

The claimant made a claim for incapacity benefit for a period starting three months before her actual date of claim. Her claim was refused on the ground that the first five days of that period were within six months of an earlier decision finding her capable of work and that therefore she could not be treated as incapable of work pending assessment under regulation 28 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations. On appeal she argued that she had developed a new disease or disablement or her previous condition had significantly worsened since the earlier decision, and that therefore she was entitled to be treated as incapable by virtue of regulation 28(2)(b)(i) or (ii). The tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State's decision, finding on the evidence that there had been no new disease or disablement or worsening of an existing condition. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the findings of the tribunal on the medical evidence that there was no new condition or worsening of an existing one were findings it was open to it to reach and there was no ground for not accepting them;

2.	the question of whether a person is incapable of work falls to be determined in respect of each day of claimed incapacity within the period of claim; the six-month period in regulation 28(2)(b) must therefore be run back from each such day in the period covered by the relevant claim;

3.	the date to be measured back to is that of a (still valid) determination of the Secretary of State on the claimant's capacity for work at some earlier time, not a tribunal decision confirming it on appeal;

4.	while days which fall within six months of such a determination cannot be treated as days of incapacity (unless a fresh disease or disablement or significant worsening of an existing one is shown), such days may nevertheless be days of incapacity and this question must be addressed by carrying out the personal capability assessment.

The Commissioner substituted his own decision that so long as prescribed medical evidence had been submitted the claimant was entitled to be treated as incapable of work for the period following the fifth day of her period of claim pending a personal capability assessment, and the case was remitted to the Secretary of State to redetermine the question of the claimant's entitlement.",1,166,,,

The claimant had appealed against a Secretary of State's decision which revoked entitlement to income support on the ground that she had been living together with a man who was in remunerative employment. The decision had effect retrospectively for nearly 14 years. It was established law that in such a case it was for the Secretary of State to satisfy the tribunal that the action taken was correct. In view of the difficulty and importance of the case, a tribunal chairman directed that the Department should arrange for a presenting officer to conduct the case at the hearing. However, the Department failed to do so and did not request a postponement. The claimant and her representative attended the hearing and the representative handed in a submission. Two investigating officers from the Department were also present, one of whom requested an adjournment to allow a presenting officer to attend. After it had been ascertained by telephone that no presenting officer could arrive within one hour, the chairman briefly adjourned and, without hearing any evidence or further submissions, allowed the appeal, stating in his statement of reasons that, while it was vital for a presenting officer to be present for justice to be done, it would not be fair and reasonable to grant an adjournment. The burden of proof on the Secretary of State implied, in his view, an obligation to conduct the proceedings in such a way to enable the tribunal to function. He had failed to do so and the burden of proof had not been discharged. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner. It was accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the local officers were at fault in the way they conducted the case. Nevertheless, it was submitted that the chairman had fallen into error of law in failing to discharge his inquisitorial or investigatory role.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the function of a tribunal in every case is to carry out a complete reconsideration and redetermination of the facts and merits of the decision under appeal (paragraph 26);

R v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex parte Moore [1965] 1 QB 456, R v. Medical Appeal Tribunal ex parte Hubble [1958] 2 QB 228, R(S) 4/82, CIB/4751/2002 [reported as R(IB) 2/04] and Kerr v. Department for Social Development (Northern Ireland) [2004] UKHL 23 followed.

2.	the practical options that were open to the chairman in this case were therefore to conduct a full hearing on the material, evidence and representations before him or to adjourn (paragraphs 27 and 28);

3.	the chairman's own note of the proceedings and statement  of reasons showed he had done neither, but instead proceeded to a decision in favour of the claimant  without going into the merits of the case at all. That was an error as  the evidence before him showed the need for a proper enquiry;

CI/1021/2001 followed.

4.	the duty of a tribunal to investigate the issues before it could legitimately involve questioning a claimant, even with probing questions, and there could be no question of bias or unfairness in the mere fact that it did so (paragraph 30);

5.	the Tribunal of Commissioners noted and approved an assurance by the Secretary of State that measures were to be taken to ensure the attendance of a presenting officer in any case where directed by a tribunal, or if the complexity of the case requires it whether or not such a direction has been given.

The claimant was a part-time student in receipt of income-based jobseeker's allowance (JSA). From the start of the academic session 1999-2000 he increased the amount of his academic work to the equivalent of a full-time student load. He applied for, and was awarded, a student loan. Two decisions that he was a full-time student and therefore not entitled to JSA were overturned by a tribunal; the claimant was to be treated as a part-time student. This was conceded and not at issue before the Commissioner. However, subsequently the Secretary of State had decided that he was not entitled to income-based JSA during term-time because the student loan was income to be taken into consideration in term-time and his income, so calculated, exceeded his applicable amount. A tribunal allowed his appeal against that decision, holding that a student loan was income only where defined as such in regulation 136 of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996, which applied only to full-time students. The Secretary of State appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	following an ""impressive line of authority"" (summarised in paragraphs 36 to 47) in relation to similar legislation in the context of other means-tested benefits, the correct approach to the categorisation of the loan was to consider its purpose. That was clearly to enable the claimant to meet his living expenses, and so the loan fell to be treated as income other than earnings (paragraphs 48 to 53);

Morrell v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (R(IS) 6/03)  (inter alia) followed.

2.	the loan was payable in respect of the academic session 1999-2000 and should be averaged over the 41 weeks of that session, including the Christmas and Easter vacations, producing a weekly income in excess of the applicable amount in the claimant's case (paragraph 55);

3.	the fact that the loan may not have been properly paid did not affect the position, as it should be treated as a loan properly paid until the Secretary of State for Education and Skills decided that there had been an overpayment (paragraph 64);

4.	an argument based on estoppel could not succeed, since estoppel is not available against a statutory decision-maker (paragraph 68);

The claimant appealed against a decision of a tribunal confirming an award of 12 points on the personal capability assessment. The sole matter in issue before the Commissioner was the tribunal's treatment of the activity of standing (activity 4 in the Schedule to the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 SI No. 311), upon which the tribunal found the claimant scored no points. The tribunal had found the claimant's statement that he could stand for one hour while doing the ironing incompatible with his having to sit down and that the movements the claimant made while ironing did not constitute moving around. It was common ground that the tribunal had fallen into error in as much as it considered whether the claimant could stand without having to move around, but had not properly considered whether the claimant could stand without having to sit down. Each of the descriptors under activity 4 contained the phrase ""cannot stand for more than [a period of time] before needing [to sit down] [to move around]"". The submission on behalf of the claimant was to the effect that standing meant standing stock still.  
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	it was necessary when the standing activity was in issue to consider both the requirement to move about and the requirement to sit down; CSIB/60/1996 followed;

2.	the quasi-involuntary movements that most people make in standing for prolonged periods did not count as moving around for the purposes of the assessment;  

3.	in considering the descriptors under activity 4 a tribunal should concentrate on how long a claimant could stand before needing or having to move around or sit down, usually because of pain;

4.	the tribunal had not fully considered whether during a session of one hour's ironing the claimant would need to move around or sit down because of his back pain.  

The Commissioner substituted his own decision on the evidence awarding a further 3 points for the activity of standing.",1,152,,,

The claimant in CDLA/5465/2002 had a number of physical conditions as well as learning difficulties. Her renewal claim for disability living allowance was refused and she appealed to a tribunal, which awarded her lower rate care component (as satisfying the ""cooking test"" criteria in section 72(1)(a)(ii) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992) and lower rate mobility component. The tribunal found that she did not satisfy the criteria of section 72(1)(a)(i) (requirement for attention for a significant portion of the day). She appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that the tribunal had not properly considered whether she required ""frequent attention throughout the day"" within the meaning of section 72(1)(b)(i). 

The claimant in CDLA/492/2004 had epilepsy, high blood pressure and dizziness. He appealed against a tribunal decision that, although he satisfied the day-time supervision condition of section 72(1)(b),  he did not satisfy the night-time criteria of section 72(1)(c)(i) for the highest rate, as he required attention at night only once or twice a week. 

Held, allowing the appeals, but substituting a decision to the same effect in both cases, that:

1.	in considering the proper approach to any section 72(1) requirements, the starting point must now be Moyna v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] UKHL 44, [2003] 1 WLR 1929, R(DLA) 7/03 (paragraph  7);

2.	in respect of each component, therefore, an exercise in judgment has to be made taking account of all relevant factors; in respect of none can a determination be made upon an arithmetical formula or by reference to an invariable benchmark (paragraph 9); 

3.	consequently a Commissioner cannot interfere with a tribunal's decision unless it failed to recognise the proper conceptual test line drawn by the law or, having recognised it, made a decision as to which side of the line the case fell that was ""outside the bounds of reasonable judgment"" (paragraphs 10 and 11);

4.	applying the above approach to CDLA/5465/2002, a failure to satisfy the lowest rate criteria in section 72(1)(a)(i) did not logically mean that the claimant would be bound to fail to meet the criteria for a higher rate of benefit; the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether the claimant satisfied the criteria of section 72(1)(b)(i), which had been expressly raised on her behalf in the appeal (paragraph 29);

5.	applying the above approach to CDLA/492/2004, the fact that attention was required only once or twice a week was one factor that the tribunal ought to have taken into account when considering whether the criteria had been satisfied, but it was not the only, necessarily determinative, factor (paragraph 40);

6.	in the context of section 72(1), the characteristic of frequency is not simply the number of times something occurs, but the rate at which it occurs (paragraph 12).

The Chief Commissioner took the opportunity to review the authorities and set out the correct approach to the section 72(1) requirements.",1,93,94,,

The claimant appealed against the local authority's determinations dated 26 and 28 July 1999. The effect of the determinations was to reduce his previous awards of housing benefit from 15 August 1994 to 24 August 1997 to nil. In consequence it was determined that a total of £18,254.25 benefit for those periods had been overpaid and was recoverable from him. It appeared that the claimant had been drawing housing benefit from other local authorities from other addresses as well as wrongly drawing income support and jobseeker's allowance by misrepresenting his actual level of income during the period in question. The claimant argued that under regulation 104 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, the amount of the overpayment should be reduced by any underlying entitlement he might have if all the true facts had been disclosed. The tribunal dismissed the appeal without hearing evidence after the claimant conceded that, as it was regulation 104 as it stood in 1999 which was applicable to him, the tribunal were bound by R v Wyre BC ex parte Lord (Potts J, 24 October 1997), which decided that no entitlement could arise as no fresh claim on the correct basis had been made to cover the period for which benefit had been withdrawn. The claimant intended to challenge the correctness of that decision by way of a further appeal to the Commissioner where it would not be binding. The local authority maintained that it had correctly applied the law to the circumstances of the case and declined to make any further submissions to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the appeal was brought pursuant to paragraph 6(3) and (6) of Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 and the transitional arrangements for housing benefit decisions and appeals in force from 2 July 2001 and was one against the original determinations of July 1999 (paragraph 5);

2.	the chairman was misdirected by ex parte Lord in the light of the Court of Appeal's decision  in Adan v London Borough of Hounslow [2004] EWCA Civ 101, R(H) 5/04 that ex parte Lord was wrongly decided. Regulation 104 did not require a fresh claim for a lesser amount or disclosing the correct circumstances to have been actually made before it can be determined what would have been the amount ""properly payable"" to deduct in arriving at the net recoverable amount (paragraphs 13 and 14);

3.	the onus was on the claimant to satisfy the tribunal that some identifiable amount of housing benefit was payable to him on the balance of probabilities after full disclosure of his actual means and all other circumstances (paragraph 16);

4.	all the actual income which the claimant had obtained, including wrongly obtained benefits, had to be included except where the claimant could show that the amounts were legally recoverable and  were being fully recovered from him (paragraph 19);

5.	the object of proceedings of this nature was to achieve the right result by a proper application of the law and a true determination of the claimant's entitlement.

[2005] EWCA Civ 535)",,"Residence and presence conditions - person subject to immigration control - whether declaration that sponsor ""able and willing to maintain and accommodate"" dependant relative constituted maintenance undertaking

The claimant was given leave to enter the United Kingdom for an indefinite period to join his nephew. In sponsoring his uncle's entry for the purposes of the Immigration Rules, the nephew had made a statutory declaration, stating that he was able and willing to maintain and accommodate the claimant. The claimant's claim for income support was refused on the ground that he was a ""person subject to immigration control"" defined by section 115(9) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to include a person who has leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom given as a result of a maintenance undertaking, and therefore not entitled to income support for the first five years of residence. Section 115(10) of the same Act defines ""maintenance undertaking"" as ""a written undertaking given by another person in pursuance of the immigration rules to be responsible for that person's maintenance and accommodation"". The Immigration Rules provide that the immigration authorities may require a sponsor to give an undertaking in writing to be responsible for the relative's maintenance and accommodation but there is no requirement for such an undertaking. The Commissioner, dismissing the Secretary of State's appeal against the appeal tribunal's decision allowing the claimant's appeal, held that an assertion or declaration that someone is able and willing to act in a particular way fell short of a promise or undertaking that he would or will act in a certain way. In his view an undertaking was a promise as to future conduct, whereas the declaration that the nephew had made was only a statement as to present ability and intention.  The Commissioner also stressed the seriousness of an undertaking by reference to the potential liability of an undertaking sponsor to pay back income support obtained by the dependent relative or to be found criminally liable for the offence of refusing or neglecting to maintain. He disagreed with the decision in CIS/47/2002, where the Commissioner on very similar declaratory language had found an undertaking to have been made out. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the language of the declaration was not sufficient to create an undertaking, as it had reference to current ability and intention and did not amount to a promise for the future (paragraph 47);

2.	since an undertaking is something to which the authorities will look, if necessary, for the purposes of gaining recoupment of any income support paid to the entrant, and may also involve the sanctions of the criminal law, one should not be too ready to assume that an undertaking has been given in the absence of reasonably plain language expressive of a promise (paragraph 48).",1,243,,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support and her applicable amount included housing costs under Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, initially including the full contractual rate of mortgage interest she was liable to pay. In October 1995 a new Schedule 3 was introduced providing for calculation of housing costs by reference to a standard rate of mortgage interest. Paragraph 7 of the Schedule provided, by way of transitional protection for existing claimants, for an ""add back"" to meet, initially, the shortfall between the housing costs payable in the benefit week after the new Schedule 3 came into force (the ""second benefit week"") and the amount applicable in the preceding week. Paragraph 7(3) of Schedule 3 provided for the add back to be subsequently reduced by the amount of any increase in housing costs. The standard rate decreased in stages until April 1997 and then increased in stages to a level higher than the initial rate. The claimant's contention, which was accepted by the appeal tribunal and the Commissioner, was that only increases above the level in the second benefit week operated to reduce the add back. The Secretary of State contended that any increase had that effect, and appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the natural interpretation of the language of paragraph 7(3) points to the conclusion that the comparison is with the applicable housing costs in the second benefit week rather than the immediately preceding benefit week (paragraphs 24 and 25);

2.	there is a readily understandable policy reason why the add back should be reduced by reference to a comparison with the second benefit week but no readily understandable policy reason why it should be reduced for every increase, which would cause additional hardship to claimants (paragraph 24);

3.	however, it flowed inexorably from that construction that any increase above the rate in the second benefit week operated to reduce the add back, even where there had previously been a reduction for an increase to the same level (paragraph 28).",1,174,,,

Recovery of overpayment - diminishing capital rule - whether each 26 weeks award of working families' tax credit is separate ""overpayment period"" for purposes of rule

The claimant and her husband had jointly appealed to the tribunal against decisions revising and revoking six awards of working families' tax credit (WFTC) for successive 26-week claim periods. Those decisions had each further determined that the overpayment of benefit for the relevant award period had been caused by misrepresentations about capital on each of the claim forms, and was recoverable: in the case of the first three from the claimant herself, and the last three from the claimant's husband. The tribunal rejected arguments that the capital in issue did not belong to the claimant or her husband and gave a decision leaving it unclear which of the claimant and her husband was being held liable for what amount, and on what basis. On appeal to the Commissioner by the claimant, it was not disputed that the overpaid benefit was in principle recoverable for misrepresentation or non-disclosure, but it was submitted that the tribunal had failed to take account of the provisions of regulation 14 of the Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations (the ""diminishing capital rule""), which provides for a notional reduction of overpaid capital at the end of each quarter starting on the first day of the overpayment period. It was conceded on behalf of the Board of Inland Revenue that the tribunal had erred in failing to make clear findings as to the basis on which the overpayment was being held recoverable and from whom. The Board's submission on the diminishing capital rule was that it would have made no practical difference in this case, since each 26-week award period must be considered as a separate ""overpayment period"" for the purpose of applying the rule. Thus there could never be more than one quarter's notional reduction of the actual amount of capital possessed by the claimant and her husband, before the calculation had to be started over again with a fresh claim and the rule could never operate in the claimant's favour.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	while the tests for recoverability on the alternative bases of misrepresentation or failure to disclose under section 71 Social Security Administration Act 1992 were not mutually exclusive, they were different; and the tribunal erred by failing to keep them separate, as well as by its lack of clarity of who was being made liable and for what amount (paragraph 10);

2.	it was consistent with the natural meaning of an ""overpayment period"" as defined in regulation 14(3) to treat the aggregate continuous period of the overpayments in this case as one overpayment period (paragraph 11);

3.	the principle behind the legislation about overpayments was restitutionary and not penal and to operate the rule as suggested by the Board with no reduction in recoupment of the benefit over the whole period would amount to imposing a penalty for the misrepresentations, over and above what was needed to restore to public funds the net extra benefit wrongly overdrawn: the principle was not affected by the continuous overpayment period for WFTC being made up of successive claim and award periods of shorter duration (paragraphs 12 to 14);

The claimant and his wife had separated and under the terms of the separation settlement the former matrimonial home went to his wife. She subsequently sold the former matrimonial home and bought another house. The claimant, who was at risk of homelessness, lodged in that house and paid rent for various periods between March 2001 and 2003. Their divorce was finalised at the end of 2002. In July 2003 the local authority refused housing benefit on the ground that the claimant should be treated as not liable to make payments in respect of the dwelling by virtue of regulation 7(1)(c)(i) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, which applies where a claimant's liability is to his former partner and is in respect of a dwelling which he and his former partner occupied before they ceased to be partners. The local authority decision-maker found that they had not ceased to be ""partners"" in March 2001, referring to the fact that the claimant's then wife had named him as her partner in her application for council tax benefit made at that time and that they had been paid income-based jobseeker's allowance (JSA) as a couple by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal. The tribunal allowed his appeal, accepting his evidence and that of his ex-wife, and finding that they had been living in separate households at the material time. The local authority appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that the tribunal's decision was perverse and citing R v. Penwith District Council ex parte Menear (1992) 24 HLR 115 as authority for the proposition that it was bound by the JSA decision.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal's decision was not perverse (paragraph 19);

2.	the effect of ex parte Menear was limited to requiring a housing benefit decision-maker to treat a person on income support or income-based JSA as having no income or capital and therefore automatically entitled, from the financial point of view, to housing benefit (paragraph 36);

3.	as the claimant contended that the DWP's decision as to his family status was wrong, the local authority had to reach its own conclusion on that issue, especially as it was unlikely that the DWP's position represented a considered view (paragraph 37);

4.	in cases where parallel decisions fell to be made by the DWP and a local authority, the local authority could regard the existence of a considered decision by the DWP as satisfactory evidence of a state of affairs, in the absence of anything to compel a contrary conclusion (paragraph 39).",1,129,218,,

All the claimants had relatively recent family origins in overseas Muslim countries and continuing personal ties with those countries. In each case the choice was made that the deceased should be returned to the country of family origin to be buried there in accordance with Muslim practice, although facilities for Muslim burials exist in the United Kingdom. Each claimed a social fund funeral payment, for which they met all the conditions save the condition that the funeral must be held in the United Kingdom. The claims were refused on that ground. The question on appeal was whether that condition was discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights taken with Article 8 or Article 1 of Protocol 1. The Commissioner held that the refusal involved indirect discrimination against the claimants as members of the group consisting of recent migrants, but that no substantive Articles of the Convention were engaged. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no relevant discrimination in this case, since there was no basis for identifying people who might elect for a burial abroad as a group sharing a personal characteristic within the scheme of the Convention or for assuming that recent migrants, as a group, are more likely to prefer a burial in their country of origin than in the country they have made their home (paragraphs 8 to 10);
2.	even if one were to accept that recent migrants have an identifiable status for the purposes of Article 14, any resulting grounds of discrimination would fall within the category of those which merely require some rational justification and would be well within the “margin of appreciation” allowed by Strasbourg jurisprudence (paragraphs 11 to 13);
3.	the decision of the European Court of Justice in O’Flynn v Adjudication Officer (C-237/94) [1998] ICR 608 (also reported as R(IS) 4/98) was based on the special legal status afforded by the EU Treaty to migrant workers from other Member States and there is no reason to infer that recent migrants from other countries (as a group) are subject to the same protections or that the State’s margin of appreciation in respect of them is subject to the same limitation (paragraphs 14 to 16);
4.	(obiter) the need for a decent funeral is a basic requirement of human dignity and so the funeral payment scheme demonstrates the State’s respect for family life and is within the ambit of Article 8 (paragraphs 21 to 26);
5.	(obiter) under the test enunciated in Stec and others v UK Application nos 65731/01 and 65900/01 (6 July 2005), which held that non-contributory benefits fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol 1-1, that Article would be engaged in this case; however that test was in conflict with other recent Strasbourg jurisprudence and the conflict might have to be resolved by the Strasbourg court in the future (paragraphs 27 to 29).

The applicant was the absent parent of two children in respect of whom a child support maintenance assessment was made in October 1995. In June 1998 a child support appeal tribunal allowed an application for a departure direction by the parent with care.  The applicant sought to challenge the tribunal decision by: (1) appeal to a Commissioner and then to the Court of Appeal, who dismissed his application for permission to appeal in June 2000 (both decisions are reported in R(CS) 2/01); (2) an unsuccessful application for review made in November 1998 and (3) an application for revision in April 2001 (revisions having replaced reviews with effect from 1 June 1999). He made no appeal against the decision on the first of those applications, but appealed against the refusal of revision to an appeal tribunal, who upheld the decision of the Secretary of State that the application had been out of time. The applicant appealed to a Commissioner, who dismissed his appeal and refused him permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The applicant then renewed his application to the Court of Appeal. By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal his application in April 2001 was treated as an appeal and the only issue of substance was whether the absolute time limit of thirteen months for appeals infringed Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in the case of a litigant in person faced with complex procedural legislation.

Held, dismissing the application, that:

1.	the applicant's right of access to the court had not been impaired as a time limit of 13 months adequately protected the essence of his right to go to a court (paragraph 23);

2.	the period of limitation pursued a legitimate aim of ensuring legal certainty and finality to all litigation (paragraph 24);

The claimant was a single person with no children and in receipt of income-based jobseeker's allowance. She took up a new tenancy on 11 March 2002 and claimed housing benefit on and became liable for rent from that date. She did not move into her new home until 20 March 2002 because she was awaiting a loan from the social fund for essential furniture. The local authority awarded benefit from 25 March 2002, being the Monday after she had moved, but refused to backdate the award to the commencement of the tenancy. The tribunal allowed her appeal, holding that she could be treated as occupying her new home from 11 March under regulation 5(6)(c )(ii) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. The local authority appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed the appeal on the ground that regulation 5(6)(c )(ii) could not apply because the claimant's applicable amount did not include a premium listed in that provision. The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the claimant was entitled to benefit from 18 March, holding that regulation 65(2) of those regulations applied notwithstanding that the claim for benefit had been made in the week preceding that in which the conditions of entitlement were first met. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the claim was to be treated as having been made on 20 March, that being the date on which the claimant first satisfied the conditions of entitlement to benefit (paragraph 18);

2.	the claimant did not fall within the exception provided by regulation 65(2) of the regulations to the general rule provided by regulation 65(1), because that exception only applies to new tenancies where the conditions of entitlement are met in the same benefit week in which liability to pay rent first arises and in the claimant's case, that liability had first arisen in the benefit week preceding that in which those conditions were satisfied (paragraphs 20-21);

3.	applying the general rule in regulation 65(1), that a person who makes a claim and is otherwise entitled to benefit, is entitled to benefit from the benefit week following the date on which is claim is made or treated as made,  benefit was payable from the 25 March (paragraph 19).",1,131,,,

It was argued on her behalf that the declaration was not an undertaking for the purposes of the Immigration Rules or regulation 21(3)(i) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 or section 115(9) and (10) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 because it was not contained on an official form (RON 112 or SET(F)) and therefore lacked the necessary degree of formality to be considered as an undertaking within the meaning of those provisions. It was also argued that the tribunal's decision that the undertaking was to last more than six months was perverse and, lastly, that there was no evidence to show that leave to enter had been granted on the basis of the undertaking.
Held, dismissing the application, that:
1.	the Commissioners' decisions CIS/2474/1999, CIS/47/2002 and CIS/2816/2002 were correctly decided. Whether an undertaking amounts to an undertaking for the purposes of the relevant legislation is a question of fact. In the present case, the undertaking fell within the relevant provision which was regulation 21(3)(i): ""an undertaking given by another person or persons in writing in pursuance of immigration rules within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971, to be responsible for his maintenance and accommodation"". There would have been no difference to the outcome of the appeal under the 1987 Regulations or under the 1999 Act. The document was sufficiently formal and definite to constitute an undertaking, contained an express undertaking that the claimant would be maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds and was drawn up by solicitors and witnessed (paragraphs 27-31); 
2.	there was evidence that the claimant's leave to enter was in fact granted on the basis of the undertaking paragraph 32);  
3.	the tribunal's finding that the undertaking was to last more than six months was an issue of fact and one which they were entitled to reach (paragraphs 36-37).",1,243,,,

The claimant's contract of employment required him to work 16 hours per week. His claim for disabled person's tax credit made on 8.6.01 was refused on the ground that he could not be treated as engaged in remunerative work. This was because under regulation 6(4)(c)(ii) of the Disability Working Allowance (General) Regulations 1991, the average number of hours worked over the 5 and 13 weeks immediately preceding the week of claim was less than 16 hours per week and so for the purposes of regulation 6(1)(a) of those regulations, he was not undertaking work for not less than 16 hours per week. The tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that but for the bank holidays that had occurred in the 5 week period immediately preceding the week of claim, he would have satisfied regulation 6(4)(c)(ii). He also argued that it was perverse that whilst absence from work by reason of bank holidays was not disregarded for the purpose of regulation 6(1)(a), under regulation 6(5)(c) such absence was disregarded in determining whether the claimant had worked not less than 16 hours in the week of claim or either of the two weeks immediately preceding the week of claim, for the purpose of the further condition in regulation 6(1)(c) for being treated as engaged in remunerative work. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal, holding that the focus of regulation 6(1)(a) was on the hours actually worked rather than on the contracted hours of work and applying regulation 6(4)(c)(ii) on that basis. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. He argued that as regulation 6(4)(c)(ii) permitted the use of an alternative length of time to enable the average hours of work to be determined more accurately, the Revenue ought to have adopted instead a period of three weeks in May 2001 when the claimant actually did average 16 hours work per week.                                                                                                                                                                                           
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	selecting the suggested three week period in May would distort the weekly average hours rather than enable the average to be determined more accurately and the Revenue could not be said to have reached a perverse decision (paragraph 12);

2.	the requirement of section 129(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 that a claimant is ""engaged and normally engaged in remunerative work"" was not to be taken as looking to both the factual and contractual positions nor was regulation 6(1)(a) to be taken as looking at the contractual position whilst regulation 6(1)(c) and 6(5) looked at the factual position. Regulation 6(1)(a) focuses on the hours actually worked. CTC/3593/2001 was approved (paragraph 13);

3.	regulations 6(1)(c ) and 6(5) were necessary to ensure that the current position at the date of claim was that the claimant had actually worked 16 hours in the week of claim or just before as well as having worked an average of 16 hours across previous weeks (paragraph 13).",1,106,,,

The claimant had been in receipt of income support at a reduced rate as an asylum seeker.  He was granted exceptional leave to remain on 9 July 2000 and on 24 August 2000 he claimed income support at the full rate, including a disability premium, backdated to 9 July 2000. On 30 August 2000 a decision-maker decided that he was entitled to increased income support only from 24 August 2000 and that he was not entitled to a disability premium because he had not been submitting medical certificates in support of a claim for incapacity benefit before 25 May 2000. On 13 September 2000 the claimant appealed, producing with his appeal retrospective evidence of incapacity for work. The appeal tribunal confirmed the decision and declined to deal with the disability premium, which they considered would have been the subject of a separate decision by the incapacity benefit section of the Benefits Agency. The Secretary of State supported the claimant's appeal to the Commissioner, submitting that the tribunal had erred in failing to deal with the disability premium, and that the claimant was entitled to a disability premium. 

Under the current form of paragraph 12(1)(b) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations (paragraph 12(1)(b)) the claimant's entitlement to disability premium depended upon deemed incapacity for work under regulation 28 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 for a minimum of 364 days. The condition for deemed incapacity was the production of evidence of incapacity in accordance with the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 (""the Medical Evidence Regulations""). It had been established in R(IS) 8/93 that retrospective medical evidence was acceptable for the purposes of regulation 2(1) of the Medical Evidence Regulations in its form before 13 April 1995 and specifically for entitlement to disability premium under the version of paragraph 12(1)(b) then in force. The question for the Commissioner was whether that legislation in its current form and regulation 28 could be satisfied by the production of retrospective medical evidence.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	It was clear from the wording of  regulation 2(1)(d) of the Medical Evidence Regulations that that regulation in its current form could be satisfied in respect of periods prior to the coming into existence or the putting forward of the evidence in question (paragraphs 13-14);

2.	there was nothing in the wording of the present form of paragraph 12(1)(b) to exclude the use of retrospective evidence (paragraph 15);

3.	regulation 28 could in its terms be applied to any period for which the question of deemed incapacity for work needed to be decided and retrospective evidence of incapacity was therefore acceptable where a past period was in issue (paragraphs 19-21);

4.	however, the evidence of incapacity was produced after the date of the decision under appeal to the tribunal and, since the physical production of evidence was the key circumstance for the purposes of regulation 28, both the tribunal and the Commissioner were prevented by section 12(8)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 from taking it into account (paragraphs 26-33);

5.	The Commissioner set aside the tribunal's decision and referred the case to the Secretary of State for consideration of a revision of the decision of 30 August 2000 under regulation 3(4A) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999.

Note: On 22 January 2004 the Secretary of State informed the Commissioner that the decision of 30 August 2000 had been revised, so as to increase the amount of income support entitlement from 24 August 2000 by the inclusion of the disability premium in the claimant's applicable amount. The Commissioner issued a final decision, dated 23 January 2004, to the effect that the appeal against the decision of 30 August 2000 had lapsed.",1,172,168,,

The claimant suffered from anxiety and from asthma. He claimed that the asthma prevented him from cooking a main meal and also that chronic anxiety about sustaining an asthma attack meant that he required guidance and supervision to enable him to walk out of doors. The tribunal rejected the claimant's arguments about the cooking test, although it did not address a statement from his GP that his anxiety led to problems with concentration and he should not in the GP's opinion be using a cooker or carrying hot pans, but accepted that the claimant's fear of a severe asthma attack caused him to need supervision out of doors. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal had a duty to assess all the evidence and to reach a reasoned view of which evidence it preferred and to explain the process by which it analysed the evidence when applying the statutory tests;

2.	with respect to the cooking test, not only were the claimant's physical abilities relevant but whether, through disablement, he lacked the concentration to carry out the necessary activities on a regular basis;

3.	the crux of entitlement to the lower rate mobility component was whether guidance and supervision would overcome the effects of a physical or mental disablement and enable a person to walk out of doors. A complication arose where the guidance and supervision resulted from chronic anxiety about sustaining an asthma attack.

4.	regulation 12(7) and (8) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 had been added in 2002 following the decision of a Tribunal of Commissioners in R(DLA) 4/01. The effect of the amendment was to limit the circumstances in which a claim may succeed where the impediment to walking arises because of fear or anxiety; it must for that purpose be established that the claimant's problems are symptoms of a mental disability and are so severe that he cannot take advantage of the faculty of walking out of doors without guidance or supervision (paragraphs 7 and 8);

5.	however, in regard to the asthma attacks, the quite different question to be asked was whether the claimant cannot reasonably be expected to venture outside without a companion most of the time because of the level of difficulty caused by an asthma attack (the test for lower rate mobility being distinct from the supervision test for the care component) (paragraph 9);

6.	guidance and supervision does not have to be related directly to the act of walking but it must be instrumental in allowing the claimant to go out of doors and exercise that faculty. (For the meaning of supervision, R(DLA) 3/04 cited with approval) (paragraphs 10 and 11).",1,90,,,

The claimant was the owner-occupier of a house for which he paid council tax. In September 2001 he went abroad on holiday, not returning for six months. The local authority terminated the claimant's award of council tax benefit, applying regulation 4C(3) of the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations 1992. That regulation, which was inserted into the 1992 regulations by regulation 4 of the Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Income Support (Amendments) Regulations 1995, provided for a person to be treated as ""occupying a dwelling as his home"" while he was temporarily absent for a period not exceeding 13 weeks, provided that certain conditions were met. In this case, it was undisputed that the claimant's period of absence was always likely to exceed 13 weeks, and so, on the application of the regulation by the authority, the claimant was treated after 13 weeks as no longer occupying the dwelling as his home and his award of benefit was withdrawn. The claimant appealed. He argued that under section 131 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 entitlement to council tax benefit depended on residence, rather than on any concept of the occupation of a dwelling as his home. The latter concept, he argued, was only relevant to housing benefit, arising as it did in both section 130 of the 1992 Act and regulation 5 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. On this basis, he argued that the terms of the primary legislation did not authorise the 1995 amendment to the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations and that regulation 4C(3) was therefore invalid. The tribunal dismissed the claimant's appeal. It found that section 137(2)(h) of the 1992 Act empowered the making of regulation 4C(3). The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, before whom the local authority supported his appeal. The Commissioner invited the Secretary of State to be joined as a party if he so wished and he was so joined. The Secretary of State submitted, inter alia, that the amendment to the regulations was authorised by section 137(2)(h) of the 1992 Act, and that the notions of occupation and residence were meant to be equivalent. The Commissioner held an oral hearing.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	The test of entitlement to Council Tax Benefit under section 131(3) and (11) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act and under section 6(5) of the Local Government and Finance Act 1992 is liability to pay council tax on a dwelling which is the claimant's sole or main residence and there is nowhere in the council tax statutory provisions any reference to the claimant having to occupy the dwelling as his home as a condition of entitlement (paragraphs 26 and 27);

2.	section 137(2)(h) of the Social Security and Contributions Act, which empowers the making of regulations as to when a person can be treated as occupying or not occupying a dwelling as his home, does not extend to council tax benefit where the only prescribed test is different, and the tribunal had erred in law in concluding that it did (paragraph 27);

3.	in those circumstances, regulation 4C(3) of the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations is of no effect (paragraph 26).

The Commissioner substituted a decision that the claimant did not lose his entitlement to council tax benefit by reason of his absence from his property between 27.9.01 and 19.3.02.",1,128,,,

The claimant, a single man then aged 67, was in receipt of retirement pension and income support. He suffered from arthritis of the spine and a number of other health problems and walked with a stick. On 3 October 2002 he made a renewal claim for housing benefit for the period 18 November 2002 to 16 November 2003 in respect of his assured tenancy (which he had inherited) of the property which he occupied (and in which he had been born) comprising two bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, the property being situated in what had become one of the most sought after areas of Manchester. Regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations in the form then applicable made provision for a local authority to reduce the eligible rent for housing benefit purposes to below the contractual rent if the dwelling was unreasonably large or the rent was unreasonably high. The authority applied to a rent officer to re-determine the claim-related rent and the rent officer determined this to be £70 per week (the same amount as had been determined in December 2001 when the contractual rent had been £92.31 per week). The claimant wrote to the authority giving details of his health problems, his restricted mobility and the network of support which he received in the area where he lived. The authority applied for re-determination of the rent officer's determination and the re-determining rent officer determined the market rent for the property to be £80 per week. The authority revised its decision so as to award benefit on the basis of a rent of £80 per week.

The claimant appealed to a tribunal. The tribunal accepted that the authority had in fact made its decision under regulation 11(2)(a) on the ground that the claimant occupied a dwelling larger than was reasonably required by him and that the authority, whilst accepting that the claimant was in a vulnerable category for the purposes of regulation 11(3)(a), had demonstrated that there was an active market in houses of an appropriate type in an appropriate place at the level of rent to which the claimant's rent had been restricted, the authority having relied in this respect on its own list of empty houses and the Manchester ""Homefinder"" which gave details of homes available for immediate letting. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	per Lord Bingham MR in R v Housing Benefit Review Board for East Devon District Council ex parte Gibson (1993) 25 HLR 487, regulation 11(3) is designed to make special provision for certain categories of vulnerable persons and the power in regulation 11(2) to restrict the eligible rent can only be exercised in cases where there is cheaper alternative accommodation available for the claimant which is ""suitable"" ((paragraph 16);

2.	regulation 11(6) provides that the authority shall take account of the nature of the alternative accommodation and the facilities provided having regard to the claimant's age and state of health (paragraph 18);

3.	whilst the authority identified a few of the many properties in ""Homefinder"" as being suitable for the claimant in terms of size and area it could not provide information about the accommodation other than that provided in the publication itself so that it had thereby failed to discharge the onus upon it to show that suitable alternative accommodation was available for the claimant (paragraph 19);

4.	accordingly the authority were not entitled to reduce the claimant's eligible rent on the ground that the claimant's dwelling was larger than was reasonably required (paragraph 19).	

The Commissioner substituted his own decision for that of the tribunal to the effect that the authority was not entitled to reduce the claimant's eligible rent under regulation 11(2) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987.",1,134,,,

The claimant was director of a limited company engaged in property development in the UK and Italy. A lease between the company and the landlord allowed the claimant to occupy his flat. The claimant suffered a severe stroke in March 1999, so that the company was unable to continue to do business. Payments of rent to the landlord were made by cheques drawn on the claimant's personal bank account. He made a claim for housing benefit and council tax benefit from 1 April 2001. Details of the claimant's bank accounts submitted to the local authority in support of the claim showed large irregular payments into the claimant's current account, as well as extensive use of overdraft facilities and credit cards.  The claimant explained that the main payments were received from his girlfriend in Italy. She wrote a letter saying that she had provided him with £22,375 financial support between April 2001 and May 2002. The local authority refused benefit on the ground that income from these payments, and the claimant's bank overdraft facilities and credit cards, had been used to discharge liability for rent. The claimant appealed on the ground that the monies were not a gift, and his girlfriend expected repayment. The appeal was disallowed. On appeal to the Commissioner, the local authority argued that the claimant was not liable for the rent and in the alternative that the monies from the claimant's girlfriend fell to be treated as income despite their irregular nature

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	for the purpose of regulation 6(1)(c)(ii) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (the Housing Benefit Regulations) (claimant to be treated, if reasonable, as liable to make payments if a person liable is not making them) the ""person"" can include a limited company and the other conditions of regulation 6(1)(c) were met  (paragraphs 26 to 33);

2.	for the purpose of regulation 40(6) of the Housing Benefit Regulations (voluntary payments not made or due to be made at regular intervals deemed to be capital), ""voluntary payment"" has the meaning given by Laws J in R v Doncaster Borough Council ex parte Boulton (1993) 25 HLR 195: a payment made without obtaining anything in return. Having found as a matter of fact that the monies were paid by way of loan, and that, although a lender would normally obtain something in return for making a loan - the right to repayment, in these circumstances there was no intention to create legal relations, the payments were voluntary and regulation 40(6) applied. (paragraphs 35 to 43);

3.	""income"" should be given its natural and ordinary meaning, so that the loans incurred by drawing down on the bank overdraft facilities, being  repayable on demand, did not amount to income (paragraphs 44 to 47); Leeves v Chief Adjudication Officer, R(IS) 5/99 applied.

The claimant on 9 January 2002 claimed Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC). The Inland Revenue requested further information from him and stated (which the claimant denied) that this was not supplied. On 22 April the Revenue disallowed the claim on the ground that the claimant had not established that he satisfied the conditions of entitlement. The claimant denied receiving notification of this decision.
On 11 September 2002 the claimant requested another WFTC claim form, which he subsequently completed and returned. The Revenue made an award of WFTC under this claim. At the same time the claimant submitted the information that had previously been requested and the Revenue treated this as an application for revision. On 25 November 2002 a decision was issued that purported to revise the decision of 22 April and award WFTC for the period 15 January 2002 to 15 July 2002. However the notification continued: ""This award cannot be paid. This is because your request should have been made earlier."" On 27 November 2002 the claimant appealed this decision.

The Revenue's submission to the tribunal described the appeal as an in-time appeal against the decision of 25 November and contended that the issue that the tribunal needed to consider was whether the decision-maker had rightly refused to exercise the power in regulation 4 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 to extend the one month time limit for an application for revision under regulation 3(1) of those Regulations. The tribunal apparently dealt with the case on that basis and rejected the appeal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	The decision of 25 November 2002 was in substance (and despite its wording) a decision not to revise the decision of 22 April 2002 (paragraph 11);

2.	The decision purportedly under appeal to the tribunal was the decision of 22 April 2002: an appeal following a refusal to revise is an appeal against the original decision, not against the refusal to revise - R(IB) 2/04 at paragraph 188 applied (paragraph 12). Further, a refusal to accept a late application for revision is not itself a decision capable of being appealed to an appeal tribunal (paragraph 16);

3.	On the footing (as found by the tribunal) that the claimant was duly notified of the decision of 22 April, the appeal against that decision was out of time. The time for appealing was not extended by regulation 31 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations because, since the time for applying for revision had not in fact been extended by the Secretary of State under regulation 4, the application for revision had not been made under regulation 3(1) (paragraph 14);

4.	There was no indication that either the Inland Revenue or a legally qualified panel member had considered using their powers to extend the time for appealing under regulation 32 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations, and in the absence of such an extension there was no valid appeal before the tribunal and its decision was therefore erroneous in law (paragraphs 19, 20 and 23);

5.	The tribunal could in no circumstances have had jurisdiction to consider whether the Secretary of State ought to have extended the time for applying for revision under regulation 4 : if the time for appealing the decision of 22 April had been extended, that appeal would have been bound to succeed. If not, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal at all (paragraphs 15 to 17).

The Commissioner remitted the appeal with directions that it should first be considered by a legally qualified panel member for determination (a) under regulation 31(4) whether the decision of 22 April was in fact sent to the claimant (if not, the appeal was in time); and (b) if so, whether the claimant's time for appealing should be extended under regulation 32.",1,251,,,

The claimant was awarded incapacity benefit by a decision on 20 December 2000 on deemed incapacity for work under regulation 28 of the Incapacity for Work (General) Regulations 1995. On 1 November 2001 he was assessed by an examining medical practitioner, who found problems sufficient to score more than the requisite 15 points to pass the personal capability assessment. It appeared that no copy had been retained of whatever decision or determination was made as a result. He was assessed for the second time in February 2003 and as a result a decision-maker decided that he was not entitled to incapacity benefit, superseding the original decision of December 2000 under regulation 6(2)(g) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. Regulation 6(2)(g) provides that an incapacity benefit decision can be superseded where there has been an ""incapacity determination"" (whether before or after the decision) and where, since the decision was made, the Secretary of State has received medical evidence following an examination for incapacity for work purposes by an approved doctor.

 The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal. It was submitted on his behalf that there must have been a decision in November 2001 superseding the decision made in December 2000 and it was that decision which should have been superseded in February 2003. The tribunal agreed and decided that the decision under appeal was invalid and that they could not correct the error.  The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that there had been no decision in November 2001, or, if there had been, that that made no difference to the existence or otherwise of the ground of supersession under regulation 6(2)(g). 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	if there was no superseding decision in November 2001, the original awarding decision was the current operative decision and the only one that could be superseded (paragraph 9);

2.	if there was a superseding decision in November 2001, the decision-maker of February 2003 would have superseded the wrong decision, but that was a defect which could have been corrected by the appeal tribunal under the approach set out by the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(IB) 2/04 (paragraph 11);

3.	it would make no difference to the question of whether the ground of supersession under regulation 6(2)(g) was made out which decision was being superseded, since a determination of (deemed or actual) incapacity would have been necessary to either decision and the appeal could properly have been decided on the basis that, whichever decision was being superseded, the ground under regulation 6(2)(g) was made out (paragraph 11);

4.	the Commissioner therefore did not need to decide the question of whether there ought to be a supersession decision on a claimant passing the personal capability assessment on its first application or merely a determination of incapacity (paragraph 12).	

The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal.",1,257,,,

The claimant’s claim for a Sure Start Maternity Grant was refused solely on the ground that she was caring for the relevant child under a residence order. Under regulation 5 of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 she would have been entitled to the Grant if she had had an adoption order. An appeal tribunal upheld the decision. She appealed to the Social Security Commissioner. The Commissioner rejected arguments that the reference in regulation 5 to adoption should be given a broad meaning to include a person who has a residence order for the baby in question. It had further been argued that her claim to Maternity Grant fell within the ambit of Article 8 of, or Article 1 of Protocol 1 to, the European Convention on Human Rights and that to exclude her would amount to discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention. That argument was also rejected. The Commissioner held that she had not assumed the full parental role and was not in an analogous position to a natural or adoptive parent. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary of State conceded, and the Court accepted, that the facts of the case came within the ambit of Article 8. The issue for the Court was whether there had been discrimination contrary to Article 14.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	whilst there were significant legal differences between an adoption order and a residence order, none of them had relevance to the purpose of a Maternity Grant, which was to ensure that children have a positive start in life by providing help to low income mothers with the costs associated with a new baby, and for those purposes the claimant was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to an adoptive mother (paragraphs 17 to 19);

2.	the status of persons with a residence order as compared with adoptive parents is a personal characteristic such as to count as a relevant ground for the purpose of Article 14, according to the test  set out in R (S) v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2004] UKHL 39, [2004] 1 WLR 2196 (paragraphs 21 to 28);

3.	administrative convenience cannot in itself be a sufficient justification for discrimination without some other justification as to why those in an analogous or relevantly similar situation are being excluded, and, in the absence of clear evidence that there would be seriously adverse consequences if those with residence orders were entitled to a Maternity Grant, there was no rational justification for the discrimination (paragraphs 29 to 30);

4.	it followed that the exclusion of the claimant from entitlement to a Maternity Grant was discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention (paragraph 31).

Tribunal practice - jurisdiction - whether right of appeal against refusal to give decision on a claim

In each case the claimant's local authority had purported to refuse to give a decision on a claim for housing benefit (and in three cases also council tax benefit) because the claimant had failed to supply the evidence requested, invoking regulation 76(2)(b) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (the HB Regulations) and identical council tax benefit provisions. All four claimants appealed. In CH/2155/2003, CH/3423/2003 and CH/3511/2003 the tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal. In CH/3600/2003 the tribunal held that it did have jurisdiction and that the claimant was entitled to benefit. The claimants appealed in CH//2155/2003, CH/3423/2003 and CH/3511/2003, and the local authority appealed in CH/3600/2003. The issues for the Tribunal of Commissioners were (1) whether a failure to provide evidence or information under regulation 73 of the HB Regulations rendered a claim defective and, if so, whether there was (a) a duty or (b) a power to determine such a claim; (2) whether a decision to refuse to decide a claim was appealable.

Held, allowing the claimants' appeals and dismissing the local authority's appeal, that:

1.	a failure to provide evidence or information requested after the receipt of a claim does not render the claim defective  (paragraphs 69 to 71);

2.	although not expressly created within the statutory scheme, a duty to determine claims for benefit must generally be implied into it, since to construe the provisions otherwise would, in the absence of clear statutory language, undermine the entire scheme (paragraphs 72 to 74);

3.	the power to make regulation 76 could not be implied into section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, on the ground that it was necessary in order to provide for cases where a decision was impossible because evidence or information had not been provided, since it was always possible for the authority to make a decision, drawing an adverse inference if necessary (paragraphs 76 to 85);  	
(Kerr v Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL 23, [2003] 1 WLR 1372, R1(04) (SF) applied.

4.	the proper construction of regulation 76(2) had the effect that the regulations allowed what was in substance a decision on a claim to be treated as not being such a decision, but the broad power under section 123(1)(d) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to make a housing benefit scheme did not authorise the Secretary of State to make a regulation having such an effect, and regulation 76(2) was therefore ultra vires (paragraphs 86 to 96);

5.	  it followed that the decisions of the  local authorities were to be treated as decisions that the claimants were not entitled to benefit and, as such, the decisions were appealable (paragraphs 100 to 103).

The Tribunal, having allowed the claimants' appeals against the decisions of the appeal tribunals, went on to consider the claimants' entitlement to benefit in CH/2155/2003 and CH/3423/2003 (deciding the former case against the claimant and the latter case in the claimant's favour) and referred the case in CH/3511/2003 to a differently constituted appeal tribunal.

The Inland Revenue requested further information from him and stated (which the claimant denied) that this was not supplied. On 22 April the Revenue disallowed the claim on the ground that the claimant had not established that he satisfied the conditions of entitlement. The claimant denied receiving notification of this decision.
On 11 September 2002 the claimant requested another WFTC claim form, which he subsequently completed and returned. The Revenue made an award of WFTC under this claim. At the same time the claimant submitted the information that had previously been requested and the Revenue treated this as an application for revision. On 25 November 2002 a decision was issued that purported to revise the decision of 22 April and award WFTC for the period 15 January 2002 to 15 July 2002. However the notification continued: ""This award cannot be paid. This is because your request should have been made earlier."" On 27 November 2002 the claimant appealed this decision.

The Revenue's submission to the tribunal described the appeal as an in-time appeal against the decision of 25 November and contended that the issue that the tribunal needed to consider was whether the decision-maker had rightly refused to exercise the power in regulation 4 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 to extend the one month time limit for an application for revision under regulation 3(1) of those Regulations. The tribunal apparently dealt with the case on that basis and rejected the appeal. The claimant appealed to a Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	The decision of 25 November 2002 was in substance (and despite its wording) a decision not to revise the decision of 22 April 2002 (paragraph 11);

2.	The decision purportedly under appeal to the tribunal was the decision of 22 April 2002: an appeal following a refusal to revise is an appeal against the original decision, not against the refusal to revise - R(IB) 2/04 at paragraph 188 applied (paragraph 12). Further, a refusal to accept a late application for revision is not itself a decision capable of being appealed to an appeal tribunal (paragraph 16);

3.	On the footing (as found by the tribunal) that the claimant was duly notified of the decision of 22 April, the appeal against that decision was out of time. The time for appealing was not extended by regulation 31 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations because, since the time for applying for revision had not in fact been extended by the Secretary of State under regulation 4, the application for revision had not been made under regulation 3(1) (paragraph 14);

4.	There was no indication that either the Inland Revenue or a legally qualified panel member had considered using their powers to extend the time for appealing under regulation 32 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations, and in the absence of such an extension there was no valid appeal before the tribunal and its decision was therefore erroneous in law (paragraphs 19, 20 and 23);

5.	The tribunal could in no circumstances have had jurisdiction to consider whether the Secretary of State ought to have extended the time for applying for revision under regulation 4 : if the time for appealing the decision of 22 April had been extended, that appeal would have been bound to succeed. If not, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal at all (paragraphs 15 to 17).

The Commissioner remitted the appeal with directions that it should first be considered by a legally qualified panel member for determination (a) under regulation 31(4) whether the decision of 22 April was in fact sent to the claimant (if not, the appeal was in time); and (b) if so, whether the claimant's time for appealing should be extended under regulation 32.",0,254,,,

The tribunal refused disability living allowance (DLA) after an oral hearing at which both the claimant and the Department were represented, and which the claimant attended with her husband. The claimant was seeking only the lowest rate of the care component. In her grounds of appeal she criticised the decisions of the tribunal and Secretary of State, and challenged the wording of the questions asked in the DLA claim form DLA1A in relation to the test of inability to prepare a cooked main meal (the ""cooking test"").

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the definitive interpretation of the cooking test was now that of the House of Lords in Moyna v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] UKHL 44, [2003] 1 WLR 1929, R(DLA) 7/03, which could be taken as endorsing and to some extent replacing the interpretation in R(DLA) 2/95 in confirming that the test required taking a broad view of the facts and making a judgment;

2.	in testing a claimant's abilities against the hypothetical test, a tribunal should look at all the evidence as to the claimant's ability to perform the activities involved in cooking, including direct evidence of actual difficulties with cooking and indirect evidence of other activities using the same bodily functions that are normally used in cooking; 

3.	there was no problem with the wording of the form DLA1A, as essentially it left it to the claimant to explain her or his own problems and for decision-makers to decide if the test is met;

4.	the tribunal based its conclusion on an overall view of the evidence, including the information on the claim form and, judged as a whole, its decision was an extremely thorough one on the facts.",1,97,,,

The claimant was accepted as incapable of work from 15 July 2002. Although she was not entitled to incapacity benefit because her contributions record was insufficient, she received contribution credits. She failed to submit medical statements after the one that covered the period to 17 August 2002 had expired. No further action was taken until she was sent an IB50 questionnaire and then examined by an examining medical practitioner (EMP) on 30 April 2003. On 9 May 2003, it was decided that she was not entitled to contribution credits from and including 18 August 2002 because she did not attain the required number of points under the personal capability assessment (PCA). The decision did not explain why the date 18 August 2002 had been selected. The claimant appealed. The appeal tribunal disallowed the appeal and confirmed the decision of 9 May 2003 after a paper hearing. Leave to appeal was granted by the Commissioner because the tribunal failed to explain how a decision given on 9 May 2003, which was made under the power of supersession or possibly revision, could take effect from any date earlier than 9 May 2003. Furthermore as this appeared to be the first actual application of the PCA to the claimant, the Commissioner wished to know whether the proper ground of supersession should have been a relevant change of circumstances (in the carrying out of the PCA) rather than the ground under regulation 6(2)(g) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (see paragraphs 122 to 127 of the Tribunal of Commissioners' decision in R(IB) 2/04).

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal erred in law by failing to explain the effective date of its decision, failing to identify any ground of supersession on which the existing decision could be altered and by adopting 18 August 2002 as the effective date. On the facts found by the tribunal, the effective date of the superseding decision should have been 9 May 2003 based on regulation 6(2)(a)(i) of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations (paragraph 8);

2.	 the principles stated in CIB/1031/2000 and CIB/3106/2003 applied equally to a case where regulation 28 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations did apply at the beginning of a claim or period, but a necessary condition for its operation ceases to operate (paragraph 11); 

3.	ceasing to satisfy a condition for the application of regulation 28 by not sending in medical evidence after 17 August 2002 is not a change of circumstances that justified a superseding decision removing entitlement to incapacity credits. That particular change of circumstances only showed that the claimant could not be treated as incapable of work in accordance with the PCA. The relevant change of circumstances was the carrying out of the PCA in which it was determined that the claimant was not incapable of work (paragraph 17);

4.	the effect of the PCA can relate back to the period when the deeming of regulation 28 did not apply. So if the claimant passed the PCA (eg by winning at the rehearing before the new tribunal), there would be no supersession from any date from 18 August 2002 onwards (paragraph 20);

5.	if the claimant failed the PCA, there would be supersession for relevant change of circumstances, but the decision could not take effect before 9 May 2003. For that ground to be made out through the carrying out of the PCA there would in the process have been an ""incapacity determination"". Regulation 7(2)(c)(ii) could potentially apply, but the conditions for making the decision take effect from the date of the change were not met. Thus the general rule in section 10(5) of the 1998 Act had to apply (paragraph 19).

The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal and referred the case to a differently constituted tribunal for determination.",1,257,,,

The father had an income from an occupational pension and also self-employed earnings. His full income tax personal allowance was exhausted in respect of his pension income. However, in calculating his income for assessment of child support maintenance, the Child Support Agency applied a notional tax liability, deducting the full relevant personal allowance from his self-employed earnings. A tribunal allowed his appeal. The mother (the parent with care) appealed to the Child Support Commissioner, with the support of the Secretary of State, who argued that the tribunal had erred in relying on paragraph 3(5) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (the MASC Regulations), and that paragraph 2A(3) (the relevant provision) had the effect that a notional tax liability must be applied.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the wording of the legislation, expressly referring to the deduction of an amount equivalent to any personal allowance ""applicable to the earner"" by virtue of the provisions of the relevant income tax legislation, implied that the Agency must in this situation have regard to the personal allowance actually awarded, not to any notional tax liability (paragraphs 24 to 25); CIS/12230/1996, on the construction of the similar (but not identical) regulation 39 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, distinguished (paragraphs 26 to 28);

2.	if this were wrong and a notional personal allowance should be applied, the same result would be reached by applying the disregard in Schedule 2, paragraph 2 to the MASC Regulations to the aggregate income so calculated (paragraphs 29 to 32).",1,32,,,

Care component  severe mental disablement  whether late development amounts to mental disablement

The claimant, who was aged six at the time of the decision under appeal, suffered from constipation and encopresis (faecal soiling), mainly during the day, and also bedwetting at night. Her claim for disability living allowance was disallowed by the Secretary of State. The tribunal dismissed her appeal, reasoning that night-time incontinence at her age was within the normal range of development and therefore she did not have attention or supervision needs substantially in excess of those of another child of the same age, as required by section 72(6)(b)(i) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. As to her day-time problems, the tribunal decided that they were behavioural, rather than the result of a physical or mental health disorder, and therefore the condition in section 72(1) was not met. On appeal to the Commissioner, it was argued on the claimant's behalf that the tribunal had erred in having regard to the fact that some children would be bedwetting at the age of six, when most would not. The Secretary of State argued that the tribunal had erred in failing to consider section 72(1) in relation to the bedwetting, when their reasoning clearly implied that the bedwetting was a developmental issue.

Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same practical effect, that:

1.	while the use of the word ""most"" in CA/92/1992 should not be taken as implying that the ""normal requirements"" for purposes of comparison in section 72(6)(b)(i) were those of a simple arithmetical majority of children, there came a point where the proportion of children who had the requirements was so small that the requirements could no longer be said to be normal, even though the total number of children affected might still be quite substantial (paragraph 10);

2.	however, section 72(6) came into play only where it was accepted that the child suffered from physical or mental disablement and, as a result, had attention or supervision requirements sufficient to satisfy at least one of the conditions of section 72(1), and so the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether there was evidence of a physical or mental health disorder causing the nocturnal enuresis (following CSDLA/552/2001, where it was held that enuresis is not in itself a disablement) (paragraphs 10 and 14);

3.	a young child's inability to perform functions due to immaturity is not disablement within the scope of section 72(1) and so, where there is no identifiable physical problem in an older child, it is necessary to distinguish between unexceptional developmental delay and delay due to some mental disorder (paragraph 15);

4.	the tribunal might have erred in finding that it was normal for six year olds to suffer from nocturnal enuresis, but their finding that it did occur in a significant number of cases where there was no physical or mental disablement, taken in conjunction with the lack of other evidence of physical or mental disablement in this case, had the effect that it could not be established on the available evidence that the claimant's nocturnal enuresis was caused by any physical or mental disablement (paragraphs 16 and 17);

5.	the claimant's enuresis did not, in any event, give rise to sufficient requirements for attention to satisfy the conditions of section 72(1) because any requirement for attention at night was reasonably avoided through the use of nappies and, while putting the claimant in nappies when she went to bed and bathing her in the morning were activities to be taken into account as day-time attention, they did not amount to the provision of attention for a significant portion of the day or frequently throughout the day (paragraph 17).",1,95,83,,

Recovery of overpayment – failure to disclose – claimant lacking capacity to understand materiality of fact – whether recovery of the overpayment was a breach of claimant’s human rights 
The claimant, who has severe learning disabilities, received an overpayment of benefit after her children were taken into care and removed from her home. Though able to read she was not capable of understanding the information provided to her by the Benefits Agency that she should report her children’s removal as a change of circumstances. The Secretary of State claimed an entitlement to recover the consequent overpayment under section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 on the ground that the claimant had failed to disclose a material fact. The claimant appealed to a tribunal which allowed the appeal. The Secretary of State’s appeal was upheld by a Tribunal of Commissioners. The claimant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal [2005] EWCA Civ 929 was dismissed and reported in R(IS) 9/06. The claimant applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the issues before the court were whether the recovery of the overpayment of benefit from her was: (1) a breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of discrimination) and Article 1 of Protocol 1 (protection of property); (2) a discriminatory act as it treated persons in similar situations differently; and (3) a failure to recognise the particular problems experienced by persons with learning difficulties. 

Held there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention read together with Article 1 of Protocol 1 because:
1.	insofar as the decision to recover the overpaid benefit was concerned there was no breach of Article 14. Only if the claimant’s possessions had been involved would Article 14 be engaged but they were not, as the claimant had no right to the overpaid benefit and there was no attempt to use her existing belongings to meet the debt. Unlike the case of Moskal v Poland [2009] ECHR 1286, the overpayment was caused by the claimant’s failure to report a change of circumstances (and was not an official error) and it would be perverse for claimants to acquire a right to overpaid benefit arising from their failure to report any changes. But the practice of reducing the claimant’s benefit so as to recover the overpayment might be an interference with the claimant’s possessions (paragraphs 33 to 43); 
2.	in deciding whether discrimination was justified a contracting State was entitled to a margin of appreciation which varied according to circumstances. In relation to general measures of economic or social strategy a wide margin is usually allowed to a State because national authorities are better placed than international judges to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds. Accordingly the ECtHR will generally respect the national legislature’s policy choice unless it was “manifestly without reasonable foundation”. A difference in treatment is only discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (paragraphs 54 to 56);
3.	the failure to treat the claimant differently from persons who understood the reporting requirement was justified. Claimants who failed to report a material fact of which they had no knowledge were not analogous or similar to claimants who failed to report a fact because they did not realise it was material. The first is a simple logical fact as you cannot report something you do not know whereas a failure to report something you fail to realise you should report depends on your cognitive capacity and moral sensitivity. The decision not to treat the claimant differently pursued the legitimate aim of ensuring the efficiency of the welfare system including the recovery of overpaid benefit. It was also proportionate, being in accordance with the doctrine of unjust enrichment and the efficient use of scarce public resources. Accordingly it was fair to other taxpayers while the claimant was not placed under an excessive financial burden by the recovery of the overpayment (paragraphs 57 to 62).



Recovery of overpayment – failure to disclose – claimant lacking capacity to understand materiality of fact – whether requirement that disclosure be reasonably to be expected 
The claimant, who had quite severe learning disabilities, was in receipt of income support. Her children were taken into care and removed from her home. The claimant, though able to read, was not capable of understanding the information on Form INF4 or in her order book that she should report their removal as a change of circumstances. The Benefits Agency continued to pay child-related benefit premiums for a substantial further period, and an overpayment resulted, which the Secretary of State claimed an entitlement to recover under section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 on the ground that she had failed to disclose a material fact. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which allowed the appeal. The Secretary of State appealed and the Chief Commissioner convened a Tribunal of Commissioners to hear the case as of special legal difficulty involving consideration as to the correctness of conflicting Commissioners’ decisions as to the nature of the duty to disclose a material fact.
Held by the Tribunal of Commissioners, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	section 71 does not purport to impose a duty to disclose, but rather presupposes such a duty, the actual duty in this case being in regulation 32 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, which provides for (a) a duty to furnish information and evidence pursuant to a request from the Secretary of State, and (b) a duty to notify the Secretary of State of any change of circumstance which the claimant might reasonably be expected to know might affect the right to benefit (paragraphs 30 to 32);
2.	in relation to the duty to furnish information and evidence pursuant to a request, whilst there is no duty to disclose that which one does not know, if a claimant was aware of a matter which he was required to disclose, there was a breach of that duty even if, because of mental incapacity, he was unaware of the materiality or relevance of the matter to his entitlement to benefit, and did not understand an unambiguous request for information, and a failure to respond to such a request triggered an entitlement to recovery under section 71 of any resulting overpayment (paragraphs 33 to 46);
3.	insofar as R(SB) 21/82 imported words from regulation 32 into the construction of section 71 in stating that the non-disclosure must have occurred in circumstances in which, at lowest, disclosure by the person in question was reasonably to be expected, that decision and subsequent decisions that have relied on it were wrongly decided (paragraphs 47 to 61);
4.	the form INF4 supplied to claimants contained an unambiguous request by the Secretary of State to be informed if a claimant’s children went into care and by not disclosing the fact to the Department, the claimant was in breach of her obligation under regulation 32, so that the Secretary of State was entitled under section 71 to recover the overpayment resulting (paragraph 62).
The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal it was additionally argued for the claimant that the recovery of an overpayment of benefit from a claimant who is incapable of understanding that there is something to report was in breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of discrimination) taken with Article 1 of Protocol 1 (Article 1P1) (protection of property).
Held by the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	recovery of an overpayment of benefit from a claimant who is incapable of understanding that there is something to report had no connection with deprivation of possessions and therefore Article 1P1 was not engaged; however, mental capacity was arguably at least as sensitive a personal characteristic, in relation to discrimination, as race or sex and if the alleged discrimination had been sufficiently related to Article 1P1, persuasive arguments as to justification would have been required (paragraphs 17 to 26, 52 to 53);
2.	there is no basis for the construction in R(SB) 21/82, the reasoning for which was unclear and which had not been subjected to further analysis in the Commissioner’ decisions that followed it; section 71 and regulation 32 make no such allowance and leave room for none and there is no basis in section 71 for imposing or requiring a moral obligation to disclose in addition to the legal obligation imposed by regulation 32 (paragraphs 36 to 40, 47 to 49).	
The claimant’s petition to the House of Lords for permission to appeal was refused. The European Court of Human Rights upheld the judgment on 14.02.12, application no. 36571/06

The claimant had been in receipt of income support from 1996 both on the basis of her incapacity for work and also as a lone parent. The award was superseded after the claimant admitted that she had a partner who was in remunerative work. As a result an overpayment of income support had been made which was recoverable from the claimant. On her behalf it was averred that she should have received a higher rate heating addition for supplementary benefit which would have led to a transitional addition to income support. It was also contended that she may have been entitled to a disability premium for an earlier period. This would give rise to an appropriate offset under regulation 13. All records held by the Department for Work and Pensions had been destroyed. The claimant appealed to a tribunal which dismissed the appeal concluding that the onus was on the claimant to establish an entitlement or additional entitlement relevant to the application of an offset. Previous awards had been made on the basis of information provided by the claimant and there was no evidence that such awards had been challenged, nor had the claimant now produced any evidence which supported the claimed entitlement. The onus did not lie on the Department when considering a potential underpayment. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the reference to the Public Records Act 1958 in CIB/378/2002 was in a different context to the present case. What constituted a ""public record"" was imprecisely defined as was the differentiation between documents which ought to be ""permanently preserved"" and those which were to be destroyed. The Act does not assist in the resolution of problems which result from missing documents (paragraph 39);  
2.	it did not seem reasonable to expect the Department to retain claim forms for ever to meet the possibility of a potential claim for offset. The decision of the Lords of Appeal in Kerr (AP) (Respondent) v Department for Social Development (Appellants) (Northern Ireland) 2004] UKHL 23, [2004] 1 WLR 1372, R 1/04 (SF) did not mean that contrary inferences should necessarily be drawn from the destruction of such forms. No presumptions ought to made by a tribunal about the existence or contents of such forms without evidence. It was for the tribunal to consider whether it was more probable than not that the circumstances for a deduction under regulation 13 existed at any relevant time (paragraphs 40, 41 and 42);
3.	it is clear from section 1(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 that it is for the claimant to establish that the conditions of entitlement are met and that the claimant must bear the consequences of ignorance. Therefore one who must pay benefit back because it has been demonstrated that she should never have had it, necessarily has the same task in establishing a similar entitlement to offset against a proven debt. The onus of proof lies on the Department to establish an overpayment of benefit but the onus is on the claimant who seeks a deduction by way of offset (paragraphs 46 to 48).",1,232,,,

The claimant, who suffered from dizzy spells and osteoarthritis, applied for both the mobility and care components of disability living allowance. Both the adjudication officer and the appeal tribunal refused to make an award. The Commissioner refused leave to appeal since the ground of appeal did not raise any proper issue of law. The claimant sought judicial review of the Commissioner's determination by petition to the Outer House of the Court of Session.

Held, refusing the petition, that:

1.	there were three criticisms contained in the petition: (i) that the Commissioner had refused leave where the appeal tribunal had failed to have proper regard to the statutory test on virtual inability to walk, and that this was a ground of appeal contained in the notice of application to the Commissioner; (ii) that the Commissioner had failed to grant leave where the appeal tribunal had made obvious errors of law; and (iii) that in refusing leave the Commissioner erred in law in making his determination that ""the distance covered would be sufficient to negate any award"" (paragraph 29);

2.	in regard to the first criticism, the application to the Commissioner could not be read as containing an express ground that the tribunal had misdirected itself or otherwise misapplied the correct statutory test. The third criticism did not disclose a material error of law in that what was criticised was essentially a judgement by the Commissioner when considering the appeal tribunal's statement of reasons based on a purposive construction of the legislation and on his knowledge and understanding of social security principles and practice. (R (Anayet Begum) v. Social Security Commissioners and Cooke v. Secretary of State for Social Security, R(DLA) 6/01, cited with approval.) (paragraph 30);

3.	in regard to the second criticism, the appeal tribunal and the Commissioner were exercising an inquisitorial function. It was not straightforward for a Commissioner, simply on a consideration of the documents, to determine whether there was a failure on the part of the appeal tribunal to ask all the questions which should have been asked. Guidance on the proper approach is contained in R (Anayet Begum) v. Social Security Commissioners (paragraphs 31 to 34);

4.	it was not a valid criticism of a decision-maker, having an obligation to make findings and give reasons, that the decision does not canvass all relevant possibilities and demonstrate that they have been excluded when such issues have not been raised as issues before the decision-maker (paragraph 35);

5.	section 12(8)(a) of the Social Security Act 1998 states that an appeal tribunal need not consider any issue that is not raised by the appeal. While it is not necessary for an issue to arise that it be raised by a party, even if represented by a skilled representative, the issue must be one which obviously demands attention (paragraph 35);	

6.	on the basis of this analysis, the Court could not regard the Commissioner as having fallen into error of law when refusing to grant leave to appeal (paragraph 37).",1,66,,,

The claimant reached the age of 60 in 1997. In 1998 the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations 1998 (the 1998 Regulations) came into force, providing for payments to, inter alia, men over 65 and women over 60, who were in receipt of retirement pension and ordinarily resident in Great Britain. The claimant was resident in Great Britain at that time, but was not eligible for a payment as he was only 60. From 1999 he was ordinarily resident in France. On 19 December 1999 the European Court of Justice held in R v Secretary of State for Social Security ex parte Taylor (Case C-382/98) [1999] ECR I-8955 that winter fuel payments fell within the scope of Article 3(1) of Directive 79/7/EEC and that the discrimination between men and women which existed as to the age at which the winter fuel payments were payable could not be objectively justified. The 1998 Regulations were accordingly revoked and replaced by the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations 2000 (the 2000 Regulations), which gave entitlement to men and women who had attained the age of 60 in the qualifying week. The condition of ordinary residence in Great Britain was retained. In July 2002, after protracted discussion with the European Commission, the British Government acknowledged that winter fuel payments constituted old-age benefits within Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and were accordingly “exportable” to other Member States under Article 10 of that Regulation in the case of individuals who had become entitled to winter fuel payments before ceasing to be ordinarily resident in the UK. The claimant claimed winter fuel payments for the years 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 in November 2002, and applied for payments for 1997/1998, 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 in December 2002. His claims for the winters of 1997/1998 to 1999/2000 were met because there was no time bar prescribed in the 1998 Regulations. His claims for 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 were refused on the ground that the claims were not made within the time prescribed by the 2000 Regulations, namely before 31 March 2001 and 31 March 2002 respectively. The claimant appealed and an appeal tribunal upheld the decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner allowed his appeal, holding (following Fantask A/S v Industriministeriet (Case C-188/95) [1997] ECR I-6783 and other authorities) that Community law on the effective enjoyment of Community rights required the UK Government to allow a reasonable time following the agreement of July 2002 in which claims for the two years in question could be made, since it was virtually impossible or excessively difficult to make a claim before the date of that agreement. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the Deputy Commissioner was correct in holding that the jurisprudence requires that the procedural rules for the implementation of European law must comply with the principle of equivalence, ie the national time limit must apply equally to national claims as to Community-based claims; and with the principle of effectiveness, ie it must not make reliance on Community law virtually impossible or excessively difficult (paragraph 25; 

2.	the imposition of a reasonable time limit will not fall foul of those principles and is an application of the principle of legal certainty which protects both the individual and the administration (paragraph 25; 

3.	the application of Emmott v Minister of Social Welfare (Case C-208/90) [1991] ECR I-4269, which held that a Member States was precluded from relying on national procedural rules relating to time limits for bringing proceedings so long as it had not properly transposed a Directive into its domestic legal system, should be confined to very exceptional circumstances, where in some unconscionable way the State had obstructed the exercise of the individual’s judicial remedy or contributed to his failure to exercise it, thus breaching the principle of effectiveness which underpins this jurisprudence ((paragraph 50;

4.	a potential claimant is presumed to know the law and (agreeing with the Advocate General’s opinion in Fantask) cannot be considered not to have notice of a requirement of European law merely because it has not been implemented; and the claimant’s position is all the weaker when his rights flow from a Regulation which is directly applicable, rather than a Directive (as in Fantask) which needs transposition into national law (paragraphs 46 to 47;

5.	hence it was not virtually impossible or excessively difficult for the claimant to make a claim before the date of the agreement and the time limits for the claim were lawful (paragraph 48.

A decision was made, following a medical examination, superseding the claimant's award of incapacity benefit on the ground that he was not incapable of work under the personal capability assessment. Paragraph 25 of Schedule 1B to the Social Security Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (the 1987 Regulations) includes among the prescribed categories of persons who can be entitled to income support a person who has made and is pursuing an appeal against a decision embodying a determination that he is not incapable of work. The claimant claimed income support a few days after receiving the decision on his incapacity, but made his appeal against that decision some two weeks later. The Secretary of State awarded income support, but only from the date that the appeal was treated as made. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which held, citing CIS/2075/2002, that the legislation implies that a claimant is entitled to income support in respect of the period between the incapacity decision and the appeal. The Secretary of State appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	there is nothing in the legislation which implies that, once a valid appeal is made, the claimant should be considered to have fallen within that category from the effective date of the superseding decision; the words ""but only for the period prior to the determination of his appeal"" merely indicate that paragraph 25 ceases to apply when the appeal has been determined (paragraph  12.1};

2.	it does not follow from the purpose of the legislation, namely to enable claimants to protect their benefit position pending appeal without having to apply for jobseeker's allowance, that it is necessary to imply that there is entitlement to income support in respect of the whole period between the date of the decision on incapacity and the date of the appeal against that decision (paragraph 12.2);

3.	there is no automatic provision in regulation 19 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 for backdating of a claim in such circumstances, which suggests that there is no automatic backdating of any of the other conditions of entitlement (paragraph 12.3);

4.	because the time for appealing can be extended for up to a year where there are reasonable prospects of success, such an implication would appear to admit the possibility of entitlement to income support arising retrospectively for up to 13 months after the date of the decision on incapacity, and in circumstances where the appeal could have been brought much earlier (paragraph 12.4);

5.	regulation 4ZA(4) of the 1987 Regulations and regulation 19(6) and 19(7)(d) of the Claims and Payments Regulations protect a claimant who appeals as soon as practicable from losing benefit entitlement (paragraph 12.5).

The decision-maker had calculated the interest on the maximum loan limit, which had the effect of allowing him more interest than he was actually paying. The tribunal had held that only the minimum payment calculated on the current outstanding balance was to be taken. The absent parent contended that the ""planned payment"" calculated on the original balance should be taken.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal was right to direct that the monthly amounts to be used in calculating his exempt and/or protected income under Schedule 3 were limited to the minimum monthly payments he was contractually obliged to pay to his mortgage lender;

The claimant was receiving income support for himself and his family. He completed on the Inland Revenue website an on-line application form for child tax credit and transmitted it to the Inland Revenue. The on-screen information stated that he would receive an award or rejection by post to sign and return to the Inland Revenue to ""complete the application process"". He subsequently received a TC602 letter containing details of the amount awarded and a declaration with spaces for signature by him and his wife. The claimant then obtained advice on the basis of which he decided not to sign and return the TC602 notice, as he would be better off by retaining entitlement to income support as his income then exceeded his applicable amount. Nevertheless, payments of tax credit were started and his income support award terminated. The claimant appealed against the income support decision, arguing that he had only made a preliminary application, which would not be completed until he signed the TC602 letter, so that the Board had no authority to make an award of child tax credit. The tribunal made no findings as to whether the on-line application was a valid claim, but mistakenly treated the TC602 letter as issued pursuant to section 14(2) of the Tax Credits Act 2002, and decided that the failure to postpone making an award until the claimant had replied to the TC602 letter did not render the award of child tax credit invalid. It dismissed the appeal, stating that the Secretary of State had no option but to terminate the award of income support under regulation 7 of the Social Security (Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit) (Consequential Amendments) Regulations 2003 (the Consequential Amendments Regulations), which had the effect of treating a claimant as having child tax credit if entitled to it, whether or not it was actually received. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	had the tribunal properly addressed the issue, it could only have concluded that the claimant and his wife claimed child tax credit and were validly awarded it, as the legislation clearly authorises the making of a claim by electronic communications (paragraphs 21 and 22);

2.	while the information on-screen after his form was submitted and in the TC602 letter was ambiguous, it was plain from the terms and lay out of the website that when the claimant submitted the application form by clicking the relevant instruction he was making a claim for child tax credit (paragraphs 25 to 27);

3.	once a decision has been made on a claim, it cannot be withdrawn, at least where the award is for a definite period (following R(U) 2/79 and R(U) 7/83) (paragraph 28);

4.	the effect of regulation 7 of the Consequential Amendments Regulations is to deem a claimant's income to include the amount equivalent to that contained in the operative award of child tax credit, even though strictly the question of entitlement for the tax year 2003/2004 is not decided by the Board until after the end of that year (paragraph 31).",1,273,111,,

The claimant's claim for income support was rejected on the ground that her income exceeded her applicable amount. Her income consisted of a state retirement pension, which was payable gross of tax but on which she was liable for a small amount of tax. She appealed, contending that her income for income support purposes should be computed after tax, giving her entitlement to income support. Her appeal was dismissed by an appeal tribunal, holding that on a strict construction retirement pension did not fall within the disregard under paragraph 1 of Schedule 9 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 of  ""any amount paid by way of tax"" on ""other income"" under regulation 40 of those Regulations, because the liability to pay the tax did not arise at the time of receipt. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State contended that the disregard applied only where the tax had already been paid.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the Secretary of State's construction would produce the result that certain types of income other than earnings were to be calculated gross of tax, whereas all other income is calculated net of tax, which the draftsman could not have intended (paragraph 19);

2.	it would also produce a difference in treatment between income support claimants who are in receipt of pension income, depending purely on whether the income was subject to deduction of tax at source, which could not be the intended outcome, given that the two claimants' level of financial need was in principle the same (paragraph 20); 

3.	on the Secretary of State's construction the only circumstance in which paragraph 1 of Schedule 9 would apply at all was where tax was deducted by the payer, and if that had been the draftsman's intention, he would have used the words ""amount deducted by way of income tax"" as he did in providing for calculation of earnings of employed earners in regulation 36 (paragraph 21);

4.	deduction of tax by the payer is not the same thing as payment of tax to the Inland Revenue and the Secretary of State's construction would therefore be straining the language used in paragraph 1 of Schedule 9 (paragraph 22);

5.	paragraph 1 is not concerned with the time at which tax is paid; it applies to tax which, at the date of the benefit decision, either has been paid or is to be paid on the pension income attributable to the benefit weeks in question, and where that tax is an annual sum, regulation 32(1) provides for calculating the weekly amount of the payment (paragraphs 24 and  25).",1,176,,,

The claimant received incapacity benefit and an occupational pension. Section 30DD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provides that, where the amount of occupational pension ""payable"" to a claimant exceeds a threshold, his or her incapacity benefit is to be reduced by half the excess amount but does not specify whether the amount of pension to be taken is the amount gross or net of tax. In calculating the reduction of occupational pension in the claimant's case, the decision-maker used the gross weekly amount of pension. The claimant's appeal to a tribunal was unsuccessful. On appeal to the Commissioner, he argued that the amount of pension net of tax should have been used in calculating the reduction. The Secretary of State argued that on the literal construction of section 30DD the reference to ""a pension payment payable"" was to the gross amount.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	on a literal construction of section 30DD both meanings contended for were possible and it was therefore necessary to decide which of the two possible meanings Parliament intended (paragraph 23); 

2.	no assistance could be derived from considerations of ""symmetry"" between the tax treatment of the pension and that of the incapacity benefit, since the tax treatment was different for the different rates of incapacity benefit (paragraphs 23 to 25);

3.	an examination of the legislative context of Section 30DD was equally unhelpful, since there was no uniform practice of taking payments of pension or other income as either gross or net (paragraphs 37 and 38);

4.	the most reliable guide to the meaning of Section 30DD was R(U) 8/83, of which Parliament must be taken to have been aware when it enacted section 30DD. Although that case dealt with different wording, referring to pension payments which ""are made"", that difference of wording could not affect the amount of money that is in issue (paragraphs 39 to 41);

5.	therefore, following R(U) 8/83, the decision-maker was correct in using the gross amount of pension in calculating the abatement of the claimant's incapacity benefit (paragraph 42).",1,171,,,

In September 2000 a housing benefit review board (HBRB) upheld a determination of the local authority refusing the claimant's claim for housing benefit. In December 2000 the claimant wrote a letter requesting that the HBRB decision be set aside pursuant to regulation 86 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. In July 2001 a new regime came into effect and the claimant's application was considered by an appeal tribunal, which dismissed it. The claimant then requested a review of the HBRB's decision under regulation 79(1) of the revoked 1987 Regulations on the ground that the decision was based on a mistake as to a material fact and, when that was refused, for a supersession under the new regime on the same ground. The authority refused this request, on the ground that supersession did not operate retrospectively and could not therefore assist the claimant, who had left the tenancy in issue in July 2001. Revision operated retrospectively, but was not possible, except in case of official error, where more than 13 months had passed since the decision in issue. The claimant appealed against the refusal of supersession to another tribunal, and then told the tribunal that he had made a request before July 2001 for a review of the HBRB decision, which the authority had not determined. The tribunal referred the case back to the authority, which then appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner referred the case back to a tribunal with directions to make findings as to whether the claimant had made written representations as required by regulation 79(2) of the 1987 Regulations. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal all the preceding arguments were abandoned and with the agreement of the appellant a  new argument put forward that the original determination of the authority should be revised on the ground of official error.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

The legislation does not provide a right of appeal against a refusal to revise on the ground of official error (following the decision of the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(IS) 15/04) (paragraphs 10 to 13).

The claimant was separated from her husband, who remained in the matrimonial home. Her claim for income support was refused on the basis that she had capital of a value equal to half the value of the property after deducting the mortgage and the presumed costs of sale. She appealed and the tribunal dismissed the appeal on the ground that the matrimonial home was not ""on the market for sale"", apparently, though not explicitly, applying paragraph 26 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. That paragraph provides for there to be disregarded any premises where the claimant is taking reasonable steps to dispose of them, for a period of 26 weeks from the date on which he first took such steps, or such longer period as is reasonable in the circumstances. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was argued on her behalf that the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 10 might be applicable. Paragraph 4(b) provides for there to be disregarded any premises occupied in whole or in part by the former partner of a claimant as his home, but the disregard does not apply where the former partner is a person from whom the claimant is ""estranged or divorced"".

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	""estranged"" is a term used in respect of both people who are still married and people who have never been married and has a ""connotation of emotional disharmony"" (following R(SB) 2/87) (paragraph 12);

2.	separation does not necessarily imply estrangement but the question is whether the parties have ceased to consider themselves to be a couple and not whether, despite that, they continue to maintain friendly relations (paragraph 12);

3.	it was quite clear that the claimant in the present case was estranged from her husband and therefore she was not entitled to have the value of her interest in the matrimonial home disregarded under paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 10 (paragraph 14);

4.	however, the tribunal erred in its consideration of paragraph 26 of Schedule 10 because it took too narrow a view of the phrase ""reasonable steps to dispose of those premises""; such steps could include the bringing of ancillary relief proceedings within a divorce suit or making arrangements for a former partner to buy the interest of the claimant (paragraphs 15 and 16);

5.	the claimant's capital was valued on the wrong basis, as the value of the claimant's share would not necessarily have been half the open market value of the whole property  (following R(JSA) 1/02) (paragraph 17).

The claimant entered into a tenancy agreement for a flat on 12 February 2004. She claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit on 17 February 2004, stating that she intended to move into the flat on 15 March 2004. On 15 March 2004, following adaptations to meet her disability needs, her furniture was moved into the flat, but the claimant was in hospital and did not move in until 9 August 2004. She was however liable for rent from mid-February 2004 and for council tax from 15 March 2004. By section 130(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (the 1992 Act) one of the conditions of entitlement to housing benefit is that the claimant is liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling which he occupies as his home. Regulation 5(1) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 provides that a person shall be treated as occupying as his home the dwelling ""normally occupied as his home"", but that phrase is not defined. Subsequent paragraphs modify that rule in certain circumstances, including delay in moving into a new home and temporary absence.

The local authority refused the claimant's claim for housing benefit in respect of the flat on the ground that she was not occupying the flat as her home and refused council tax benefit on the ground that she was not in occupation of the flat. After she went to live in the flat she was awarded housing benefit and council tax benefit from 16 August 2004. Subsequently she was awarded housing benefit from 19 July 2004, four weeks earlier than the initial award, under regulation 5(6). Meanwhile she had appealed to an appeal tribunal, which on 7 July 2004 had dismissed the appeal, holding that she could not be said to have moved in until she was personally in occupation. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The local authority submitted that in order to normally occupy a dwelling, a claimant must spend at least one night there.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	from 15 March the claimant was occupying the flat as her home in the normal sense in which that expression is used (paragraphs 10 and 21(4));

2.	in regulation 5(1), the word ""normally"" is used to deal with the case where there is more than one possible dwelling which might be treated as the claimant's home, and is not directed to any question of length of occupation of a single dwelling (paragraph 21(2));

3.	the expression ""move in"" occurs only in subsequent paragraphs of regulation 5 which modify the general rule by spelling out the boundaries within which, in certain circumstances, a claimant can be treated as occupying the dwelling as his home for housing benefit cases (paragraph 14);

4.	the claimant had moved into the flat for the purposes of regulation 5(6) when she removed all her furniture from her previous home and moved it into the new flat (paragraph 16);

5.	whatever the general meaning of ""the dwelling normally occupied as his home"" in regulation 5(1), when the claimant was temporarily absent from the property, she had to be treated as if she was there to the extent that she fell within one of the provisions of paragraphs 8B and 8C, but could not otherwise be treated as occupying it as her home during her absence (paragraphs 17 to 19);

6.	the claimant fell within paragraph 8B(a) of regulation 5 because she did intend to return to occupy the dwelling as her home. The word ""return"" in this context required that she should previously have occupied the dwelling, but that occupation could be by her agents who moved her property into the dwelling and did not have to be by her personally (paragraph 21). She was therefore to be treated as occupying the property as her home from 15 March, and also, by virtue of regulation 5(6) for a period of four weeks prior to that date, that is from 16 February;

7.	The claimant was resident in the flat from 15 March 2004 and therefore entitled to council tax benefit from that date (R(H) 4/05 followed) (paragraphs 23 and 24).",1,131,,,

The claimant was seriously disabled by arthritis in her back and knees and her mobility was severely restricted. She needed drinks to be brought to her during the day but could drink unaided. She also had attention needs in the morning and evening. Her claim for attendance allowance was refused by the Secretary of State and, on appeal, by a tribunal, on the ground that her need for attention in connection with her bodily functions was insufficient to meet the condition of “frequent … throughout the day” set out in section 64(2)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Both the Secretary of State and the tribunal took the view that the need for drinks to be brought to her could not be counted as attention in connection with the bodily function of drinking. The Commissioner allowed her appeal, finding that the tribunal had inadequately reasoned its decision on the facts and holding that the bringing of drinks to her could be counted as attention in connection with drinking and was reasonably required on a number of occasions throughout each day. He found that her total attention needs thus met the statutory definition. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the question of what in law constituted attention in connection with bodily functions for the purposes of section 64(2)(a) was a question of law for the court to decide, to be distinguished from questions of fact involving exercise of judgment, such as whether such attention was required frequently, on which a Commissioner’s decision could be overturned only if perverse (Moyna v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] UKHL 44, [2003] 1 WLR 1929 (R(DLA) 7/03), Mallinson v Secretary of State for Social Security [1994] 1 WLR 630 (R(A) 3/94 considered) (paragraph 8); 

2.	it was clear from the relevant authorities that the phrase “requires from another person … frequent attention in connection with his bodily functions” is to be read as a whole and that the words “attention” and “functions” denote a requirement of a close and intimate nature created by the disability beyond the normal run of domestic assistance (R v National Insurance Commissioner ex parte Secretary of State for Social Services [1981] 1 WLR 1017 (Packer’s case), Woodling v Secretary of State for Social Services [1984] 1 WLR 348 (R(A) 2/80), Mallinson v Secretary of State for Social Security [1994] 1 WLR 630 (R(A) 3/94), Cockburn v Chief Adjudication Officer [1997] 1 WLR 799 (R(A) 2/98) followed)  (paragraph 17);

3.	assistance with carrying drinks to a person has none of the characteristics of service of a close and intimate character and is not capable of constituting “attention” (paragraphs 18 and 23).

The Court remitted the case to a differently constituted appeal tribunal for the questions of fact to be considered again.

The claimant, who was an ""absent parent"", applied for a departure direction to meet the costs incurred in maintaining contact with his daughters once a month under the terms of a court order. As he lived in London and the children lived in Wrexham, those costs included overnight accommodation as well as travel. His application was refused on the ground that the expenses did not fall within the prescribed description of special expenses as required by section 28F(1)(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 as amended (""the 1991 Act""). Regulation 3(1) of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996 (""the 1996 Regulations"") provided that ""where any amount is required to be determined for the purposes of these Regulations, it shall be determined as a weekly amount and, except where the context otherwise requires, any reference to such amount shall be construed accordingly"". When converted to a weekly figure, the claimant's travel costs did not exceed the threshold of £15 a week set out in regulation 19(2) of the 1996 Regulations. His appeal to an appeal tribunal was rejected, as was his application for leave to appeal to a Child Support Commissioner. 

On his application to the High Court for judicial review of the refusal of leave, it was not disputed that the allowable expenses were limited to travel costs by regulation 14(1) of the 1996 Regulations. It was argued by reference to regulation 3 of the 1996 regulations and what would be fair (or ""just and equitable"" using the language of section 28F(1)(b) of the 1991 Act) for the monthly expenses to be treated as weekly expenses, and also that the refusal of the departure direction was in breach of Article 3, Article 6 (in conjunction with Article 14), Article 8 and Article 1 of the First Protocol.

Held, dismissing the application, that:

1.	regulation 19 of the 1996 Regulations set a threshold for the amount of special expenses in respect of which a departure direction could be given.  It followed that if that threshold were not met no departure direction could be given (paragraph 24);

2.	regulation 3 of the 1996 Regulations provided that the sum of £15 referred to in regulation 19(2)(a) was a weekly sum. It followed that the claimant failed to satisfy the threshold set by regulation 19 (paragraphs 25 and 26);

3.	neither regulation 3 nor the general proposition as to what is fair or just and equitable founded an argument that the allowable parts of the claimant's monthly expenses should be treated as weekly expenses (paragraph 27);

4.	the claimant's circumstances fell well short of the standard set for a breach of Article 3 by reference to the guidance in Pretty v. United Kingdom (paragraph 30);

5.	as the claimant did not satisfy section 28F(1)(a) of the 1991 Act, the ""just and equitable"" requirement in section 28F(1)(b) was not triggered (paragraph 32);

6.	there was force in the claimant's assertions that his ineligibility for a departure direction was not fair or just and equitable (paragraph 39), but even assuming Article 8 and Article 1 of the First Protocol were engaged and Article 8 was infringed, any infringement of his rights was justified as the child support regime was a proportionate response to a pressing social need.

Each of the three claimants had come to the United Kingdom (UK) with a view to settling permanently. They all claimed income support within a short period after arrival. The Secretary of State disallowed their claims on the ground that they were not habitually resident in the UK at the date of the decision. The claimants appealed. In CIS/3280/2003 a tribunal allowed the claimant’s appeal. In CIS/1124/2004 and CIS/1840/2004 the tribunals dismissed the appeals. The Secretary of State appealed in CIS/3280/2003 and the claimants appealed in the other two cases.

Held by the Commissioner, allowing all three appeals, that:

1.	in the light of Nessa v Chief Adjudication Officer [1999] 1 WLR 1937 (also reported as R(IS) 2/00) and R(IS) 6/96, a likelihood of remaining habitually resident is a requirement for the establishment of habitual residence in addition to a completed period of residence, but the strength of the likelihood of remaining is itself relevant when considering the length of the required period of residence and the strength of that likelihood may be demonstrated by, among other considerations, the reasons for choosing to come to the UK rather than to stay in, or go to, any other country (paragraph 15);

2.	where a claimant is likely to remain in the UK permanently or for a substantial period of time, the conventional period that must have elapsed between his arrival and his establishing habitual residence is between one month and three months, but those are not rigid limits and a shorter or longer period may be required in some cases (paragraph 16);

3.	where a claimant shows an intention to take up prolonged residence in the UK and the only reason for not awarding income support is that the claimant has not yet resided in the UK for a long enough period, the Secretary of State is entitled to make an advance award from the date on which habitual residence is likely to be established and, if he does not do so, a tribunal may make an award from that date (paragraph 25);

4.	in CIS/3280/2003, the tribunal’s decision was erroneous in point of law because it was not clear that it had regarded a present intention to remain resident and a past period of residence as being two separate requirements, but a decision could be substituted and, on the facts, a period of residence of one month had been sufficient to establish habitual residence (paragraphs 29 and 30);

5.	in CIS/1124/2004, the tribunal had erred because it had regarded three months’ residence as the minimum period sufficient to establish habitual residence, but a decision could be substituted and, on the facts, habitual residence had been established by the date of claim (paragraphs 31 and 32);

6.	in CIS/1840/2004, the tribunal had erred in law because it had not considered whether the Secretary of State could have made an advance award, but a decision could be substituted and, on the facts, a period of residence of two months had been sufficient to establish habitual residence (paragraph 34).

The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal in case CIS/1840/2004. He submitted that an advance award could not have been made by the Secretary of State because (relying on R(DLA) 4/05) to do so would have entailed the type of prediction or speculation forbidden by section 8(2)(b) of the Social Security Act 1998 (which precludes entitlement to benefit on the basis of circumstances not obtaining at the time of the decision), having regard to the retrospective nature of the requirement that there have been an appreciable period of actual residence before habitual residence is established.

Held by the Court, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the provisions for making an advance award under regulation 13 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 may apply to cases in which a claimant has a settled intention to reside in UK and where the only issue is as to the length of period of actual residence necessary to establish habitual residence (paragraphs 27, 39, 44);

2.	regulation 13 does not require the certain prediction that the conditions of entitlement will be fulfilled at a future date, but rather a judgment as to the likely continuance of circumstances obtaining at the time of the Secretary of State’s decision that will give rise to entitlement to benefit at the projected date if they do continue (CIS/459/1994, R(DLA) 3/01 and R(DLA) 4/05 approved) (paragraphs  31 to 34, 41, 44).

The claimant had been in receipt of national insurance credits. The personal capability assessment (PCA) was applied to him and following a report from a medical adviser, he satisfied the PCA. Preceding the examination by the medical adviser, he completed a questionnaire for incapacity benefit and was examined by a second medical adviser who considered that none of the claimed descriptors was satisfied. As a result, a decision-maker superseded the earlier decision awarding credits. The tribunal refused the claimant's appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State supported the appeal on one ground only: the standard of reasoning required when addressing the evidence which supported the original award.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Howker v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 1623, R(IB) 3/03 was that, with respect to any of the regulations in the Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996 which were held to be invalid, then the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) (General) Regulations 1995 required to be read as if the 1996 changes had not been made. However, the decision in Howker did not undermine the application of a valid PCA. Accordingly there was no error in the tribunal's approach to the effect of Howker (paragraph 32);

2.	an adjudicating authority had to decide whether the effect of a particular amendment made by the 1996 Regulations was potentially adverse to the claimant. In each case, a tribunal must carry out a legal reasoning process as to whether a particular amendment could be categorised as ""neutral"" (paragraph 29). The tribunal was entitled to hold that the decision-maker was wrong to apply certain descriptors in their amended form and if yes, correct the process (paragraph 31: R(IB) 2/04 followed);

3.	although a ground for supersession had automatically arisen under regulation 6(2)(g) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, this did not mean that an adverse supersession was similarly automatic. The totality of evidence, including prior medical assessments, was relevant. However, a tribunal's statement assumes an informed reader and, in the context of all the information before the tribunal and its reference to the previous medical papers, its reasoning was adequate (paragraphs 36 to 39);

4.	a tribunal's analysis of the evidence was not rendered erroneous because it did not point out in a formulaic way that even if it was wrong in one of the factors on which it had relied, nevertheless the remaining factors justify why it did not judge the claimant's evidence to be credible (paragraph 43).",1,148,,,

The claimant was a private tenant in receipt of housing benefit from the respondent Council. On 22 July 2003 he moved into a residential care home on a trial basis with the intention of returning to his rented accommodation if the residential accommodation did not suit his needs. On 25 August 2003 the claimant’s daughter-in-law wrote informing the Council that the claimant had become a permanent resident in the home on 19 August, and that the tenancy of his property would expire on 3 September. On 29 August 2003 the Council (a) superseded and terminated the Claimant’s entitlement to housing benefit with effect from 19 August 2003 and (b) decided that there was a recoverable overpayment of £28.47 in respect of the period 19 to 24 August 2003. Regulation 5(7B) and (7C) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 provides that a person who enters residential accommodation on a trial basis shall be treated as occupying the dwelling normally occupied as the home for up to 13 weeks. The claimant died on 7 September 2003. His appointee appealed against the decisions of 29 August 2003, contending that as the claimant had remained liable for rent on his former property until 3 September 2003, entitlement to housing benefit should have continued until then. The tribunal accepted that contention and allowed the appeal. The Council appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner decided that the supersession should have taken effect only from 25 August 2003, the first day of the benefit week following the date on which the relevant change of circumstances had occurred. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	paragraph 7B, which prescribes the conditions which have to apply before paragraph 7C comes into effect, requires that the intention to return to the dwelling normally occupied as the home must be present at the moment the claimant enters the residential accommodation (paragraphs 13 to 15);

2.	paragraph 7C is a deeming provision and treats the claimant as occupying his home despite being absent, and he is therefore treated as still occupying his old home even though he has manifested the intention of not returning to it after his right to exclusive possession has ended by operation of his notice to quit (paragraphs 16 to 17);

3.	the deceased remained entitled to housing benefit until the notice to quit expired (paragraph 18).

The claimant claimed industrial injuries disablement benefit for prescribed disease A11 (vibration white finger). It was accepted that he had the disease, but his claim was refused on the ground that his work in the bedding industry did not involve “the use of hand-held percussive metal-working tools”. The issue was whether the rammer used by the claimant was a “metal-working tool”. The tool was an automatic staple gun used to drive a staple over a metal spring and a metal band into a wooden bed base. The Commissioner held that the tool met the definition, as it was a tool for working with metal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the true meaning of the compound adjective “metal-working” is “a tool that works metal”, not “a tool that works with metal” and therefore the rammer did not come within the definition of those tools which may properly be described as metal-working tools (paragraphs 5 to 7);

2.	the obiter dicta in Secretary of State v Davis [2001] EWCA Civ 105 (reported as R(I) 2/01), was not authority for widening the definition, since that decision was concerned with the scope of the occupation, not the use of an identified tool (paragraphs 8 to 10).

The claimant was widowed on 23 May 2000 and on 4 July 2000 posted a claim form for widow’s benefit, which did not arrive at the relevant office of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). She was ill and did not pursue the matter until October 2001, when she sent a further claim, which was received by the DWP on 29 October. The Secretary of State awarded benefit from 29 July 2001, relying on Regulation 6(1)(a) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, which provides that a claim is made on the date on which it is received in an appropriate office. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which upheld the Secretary of State’s decision. On her further appeal, the Commissioner held that, because her original claim form had probably been mishandled by the Royal Mail, it had not been received by an appropriate office of the DWP and the claim was therefore not made until the second claim form was received. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The issue was whether the claim was made or treated as having been made by her original July 2000 claim or by her later claim. The claimant argued that regulation 6(1)(a) was ultra vires section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (the 1992 Act). The claimant further argued that section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 applied to regulation 6(1). That provides that, unless a contrary intention appears, a document required to be served by post will be deemed to have been received in the ordinary course of posting if properly addressed and posted.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	regulation 6(1) was not ultra vires the 1992 Act because, whether or not it was authorised by section 5(1) of that Act, the plain and unequivocal language of section 189(5) was wide enough to permit a regulation such as regulation 6(1) (paragraphs 17 to 26, 40, 42 to 44);

2.	Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 deals with the serving of documents and the date of deemed service and has no application to regulation 6(1), which does not have any provision for dealing with the date of service of a claim and is only concerned with the date a claim is made. Even if section 7 had applied, its application would have been excluded because of the clear contrary intention in the wording of regulation 6(1) defining the date of claim as the date it was received (paragraphs 29 to 32, 46).

The non-resident parent had income from dividends from his own company as well as earnings from employment as a director of that company and other earnings. Dividend income is not specifically mentioned in the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000, which lists the categories of income that count for the calculation of ""net weekly income"" under the reformed child support scheme introduced by the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000. The Secretary of State calculated the child support maintenance for which the non-resident parent was liable excluding the dividend income. The parent with care appealed. The tribunal found that in this case the dividends were genuine and the non-resident parent had not arranged his financial affairs in order to reduce his child support maintenance. However, it allowed the appeal, holding that dividends, while not counting as other income within the definition in paragraphs 14 to 16 of the Schedule, came within the definition of ""earnings"" in paragraph 4(1) of the Schedule as ""remuneration or profit derived from employment"". It suggested that Parliament had intended to exclude dividends on shares of unrelated companies but not dividends on shares of companies controlled by the non-resident parent. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	although the tribunal was right to say that the dividends were not other income within paragraphs 14 to 16 of the Schedule, it went wrong in law in defining what counted as earnings under paragraph 4 (paragraph 9);

2.	if payments are truly paid as dividends on shares in a company they must be regarded as derived from the ownership of the shares and the company's decision to pay a dividend, rather than from being an employee or holding the office of director, and therefore cannot count as income under paragraph 4, whether paid on shares in ""unrelated"" companies or on shares in a company by which a non-resident parent is employed or of which he is a sole or controlling director (paragraph 9).

The Commissioner confirmed the Secretary of State's maintenance calculation.
The Commissioner went on to add some brief comments on the possibility of a variation being made in circumstances like those of the present case on the basis of diversion of income under regulation 19(4) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000.

Note: Regulation 19 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 was amended by SI 2005/785 with effect from 6 April 2005 to provide a new head of variation relating to income from a company or business the amount of which the non-resident parent has the ability to control.",1,32,,,

Child support maintenance assessment - departure direction - whether taking a company car is a diversion of income

The parent with care was a partner in a firm of solicitors. He applied for a departure direction from the formula assessment of child support maintenance and the Secretary of State referred the application to an appeal tribunal. The parent with care asked the tribunal to require the absent parent to produce information which he had declined to supply to the Secretary of State. The tribunal stated that, though it could make a direction, it had no power to enforce it, and instead drew an adverse inference from the absent parent's failure to co-operate. The tribunal made a departure direction on three grounds. The absent parent appealed to the Commissioner against the tribunal's departure direction. The issues for the Commissioner were whether the tribunal had been correct in (i) drawing an adverse inference from the absent parent's non-co-operation with the Secretary of State and (ii) treating the taking of a company car instead of cash as a diversion of income.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the tribunal had erred in failing to use its power to make a direction, as it was possible that the absent parent, being a solicitor, would have complied with directions from a tribunal (paragraph 8);

2.	the tribunal could have exercised its power to summon the absent parent as a witness, and the absent parent might have complied, or, if he had not, the parent with care could have sought a penalty from the courts (paragraph 9);

3.	adverse inference does not operate in the absence of evidence, but as an additional consideration in the processes of assessing the probative worth of the evidence as a whole and of drawing inferences from the evidence available (paragraph 20);

4.	the use of adverse inference is appropriate only where it is clear that the party's lack of co-operation is indicative of an inability  to answer the opposing case (paragraph 25);

5.	in taking the benefits of a company car, which was outside the formula assessment, instead of cash, which was within the formula assessment, the absent parent had diverted income to another purpose for the purposes of regulation 24(b) of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996 (paragraph 34).

The claimant, who was in receipt of a retirement pension, ceased to be resident in Great Britain before 5 January 1998, when the first winter fuel payment scheme was introduced. Had he been ordinarily resident in Great Britain at that time, he would have been entitled to a payment. In July 2002, the British Government acknowledged that winter fuel payments constituted old-age benefits within Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and were accordingly “exportable” to other Member States under Article 10 of that Regulation in the case of individuals who were entitled to winter fuel payments before ceasing to be ordinarily resident in the UK. In 2003 the claimant made late claims for 1997/98 and succeeding years. His claims were rejected on the ground that he was not ordinarily resident in Great Britain on any of the qualifying dates. He appealed to an appeal tribunal, which upheld the decision. He appealed to the Commissioner. The principal question before the Commissioner was whether the claimant could acquire entitlement to winter fuel payments by virtue of Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, which provides that old age benefits shall not be subject to any reduction, modification, suspension, withdrawal or confiscation by reason of the fact that the recipient resides in the territory of a Member State other than that in which the institution responsible for payment is situated, or whether his lack of entitlement before he ceased to be ordinarily resident in Great Britain was fatal to his case.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	 there was no legal basis for the claimant’s arguments that his residence on a British registered boat or in Gibraltar was to be treated as residence in Great Britain (paragraphs 16 to 19);
2.	Article 10 does not have any bearing on the acquisition, as opposed to retention, of a right to benefit save where the benefit in issue is linked to a benefit already in payment and therefore cannot have the effect of disapplying a residence condition that is legitimately a condition of entitlement to the benefit in issue. The statement to the contrary in Caisse régionale d’assurance maladie Rhône-Alpes v Giletti and others (joined cases C379-381/85 and C93/86) [1987] ECR 955 is no longer good law, following the introduction in 1991 of Article 13(2)(f) under which a person who has ceased employment becomes entitled to claim benefits from a Member State to which he has moved so that it is logical that Article 10 should be construed so as not to permit the claimant also to qualify for new benefits in the Member State where he formerly lived, and later cases including Harris v Secretary of State for Social Security (reported as R(DLA) 2/99) and Movrin v Landesversicherungsanstalt Westfalen (Case C-73/99) [2000] ECR I-5625 should be followed in preference (paragraphs 34 to 38);
3.	winter fuel payments are a free-standing old age benefit, not a supplement to a retirement pension even in the case of a person actually entitled to a retirement pension, because there is no structural link (Harris followed; Movrin distinguished) and R v Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Taylor (Case C-382/98) [1999] ECR I-8955 would have been decided differently had the Court regarded winter fuel payments as mere supplements to other benefits (paragraphs 41 to 52).

In June 2001 an interim maintenance assessment (IMA) was imposed on the absent parent because the Secretary of State considered he had not provided sufficient information following a request for a review by the parent with care. In June 2002 the absent parent informed the Secretary of State that he had decided to cease self-employment and claim benefit. In September 2002 his solicitors informed the Secretary of State that he had ceased self-employment and asked for the IMA to be cancelled, but did not mention benefit. In March 2003 the Secretary of State refused to cancel the assessment on the ground that the relevant information had not been supplied. The absent parent appealed. The tribunal found that income-based jobseeker's allowance (JSA) had been awarded from July 2002, but with some gaps between that date and March 2003. It held that sufficient information had been provided to enable the IMA to be superseded, cancelled the assessment and made an assessment of the minimum amount with effect from 30 July 2002, referring the periods of non-receipt of JSA to the Secretary of State to supersede the tribunal's decision if necessary. The Secretary of State and the parent with care appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State submitted (correctly) that, by virtue of section 43(1) of the Child Support Act 1991, the absent parent was in fact exempt for most of the period at issue from the requirement to pay the minimum amount of child support maintenance, but was liable for the same amount in place of child support maintenance by virtue of section 43(2). The main issue for the Commissioner was whether that liability could be imposed directly and retrospectively, or only by deductions from the relevant benefit for a prospective period. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	(following Secretary of State v Harmon and other cases R(CS) 4/99, [1999] 1 WLR 163) in deciding whether a parent was paid a prescribed benefit for child support purposes, the question was only whether the benefit was actually paid, not whether it was lawfully paid and even if that principle were ultimately decided to be wrong, there were no sufficiently specific allegations in the present case to justify any enquiry as to lawfulness (paragraphs 13 and 14);

2.	the liability to make a payment in place of child support maintenance arises independently of the mechanism for payment established under section 43 (CCS/16904/1996 followed) (paragraph 12); it followed that the Secretary of State or an appeal tribunal could, if the rules on the effective dates of superseding decisions allowed it, make a decision on supersession effective from a past date that there was a liability to make payments in place of child support maintenance (paragraph 17);

3.	although the tribunal was wrong to hold that the absent parent had provided sufficient information about his JSA claim in his letter in June 2002, the effect of regulation 8D(8) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 was that the Secretary of State was to be treated as having received that information on the first day in respect of which JSA was payable and, by virtue of regulation 23(12) of those Regulations, that was the effective date of the superseding decision (paragraphs 18 to 20);

4.	the absent parent had argued before the tribunal that he had provided sufficient evidence, since June 2001 and independently of the effect of the award of income-based JSA, for the IMA to be cancelled and the tribunal should have recorded a conclusion on his specific contentions (paragraph 26);

5.	the tribunal had erred in failing to deal adequately with the whole period at issue in the appeal, specifically in the light of the information they had about the breaks in the award of JSA and the birth of a child to the absent parent and his partner (which would have had the effect that his maintenance assessment would be nil) (paragraphs 23 to 24 and 27 to 29).

The claimant was receiving incapacity benefit on the ground of incapacity for work. In January 2003 he started doing a small amount of part-time work. Regulation 16 of the Incapacity for Work (General) Regulations 1995 provides that a person shall be treated as capable of work for any week during which he does work unless that work meets the conditions of regulation 17. It was not disputed that the work done by the claimant met the conditions of regulation 17, at least for the first 26 weeks, apart from the requirement to notify the Secretary of State within 42 days of starting work. The claimant had not done this because he had not understood from the information provided by the Department that he had to. He eventually notified the Department on 27 August. His benefit entitlement was taken away by a departmental decision of 28 August 2003, effective retrospectively from 9 January 2003 and the resulting overpayment was determined to be recoverable. He appealed against the overpayment decision to a tribunal, which dismissed his appeal, holding that he had not made the disclosure reasonably to be expected of him in all the circumstances, applying the test consistently applied and understood by Commissioners and tribunals for many years following R(SB) 21/82. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The two issues before the Commissioner were (1) whether the Secretary of State had shown a relevant ""failure"" by the claimant to disclose a material fact and (2) if so whether the payments had been made ""in consequence of"" that failure and ""would not have been made"" but for that failure.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	(following CIB/3925/2003) the information provided by the Department was not such as to render it reasonable for the claimant to be expected to meet the notification requirement, nor, if a more stringent test applied as suggested by CIB/4348/2003, was the form of requirement unambiguous; there had therefore been no failure to disclose and the overpayment was not recoverable (paragraphs 13 to 16);

2.	if, contrary to the holding in 1, there was a relevant failure to disclose, it was doubtful whether benefit payments made for the first 42 days of working could be regarded as made in consequence of the non-disclosure, since the requirement was only to give notice by the end of that period (CIB/3925/2003 distinguished on this point) (paragraph 20);

3.	in any case, the failure relied on was not having disclosed the work from the outset on  9 January or as soon as possible thereafter; and there was no payment which ""would not have been made"" if that disclosure had been made, so no benefit paid during that period was recoverable (paragraph 21);

4.	however, it could not be assumed that benefit would have continued in payment after the end of the 26-week period, at which point the legislation  required the production of further evidence, so if there had been a failure to disclose, benefit overpaid  after the 26-week period would be recoverable (paragraphs 23 and 24).",1,227,229,,

The claimant claimed housing benefit for her tenancy of a house. She produced a tenancy agreement and stated that she was not related to the landlord or his partner. Housing benefit was awarded for a year and again on her renewal claim, on which she produced a further tenancy agreement and again stated that she was not related to the landlord or his partner. The Council discovered that the registered proprietors of the property were the claimant's mother and the mother's partner. The Council decided that the tenancy was not on a commercial basis within the meaning of regulation 7(1)(a) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, that she was not entitled to housing benefit, and that all the housing benefit that had been paid was overpaid and recoverable. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which allowed her appeal. In its statement of reasons the tribunal said that the fact that the agreement was properly drawn up was important because in CH/3008/2002 the Commissioner had observed that it would be hard to imagine that a tenancy created by law was not commercial. The tribunal went on to consider the factors said to point in favour of non-commerciality, but gave reasons for taking the contrary view. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the statement in CH/3008/2002 that a statutory tenancy cannot, at the point when it arises, be non-commercial is wrong, since the statutory periodic tenancy arising under the Housing Act 1988 has essentially the same terms as those of the preceding fixed term tenancy and arises simply by reason of the termination of the previous contractual tenancy, so that if that contractual tenancy was not on a commercial basis, then it is likely that the statutory one will also not be so (paragraph 15);

2.	on any view the tribunal in this case clearly misunderstood what was said in CH/3008/2002, as the Commissioner there in referring to a ""tenancy created by law"" was referring to a statutory periodic tenancy, but the tribunal appeared to have taken the reference to be to any tenancy contained in a formal agreement (paragraph 16);

3.	it was impossible to be sufficiently confident that the tribunal's misunderstanding of CH/3008/2002 had not influenced the outcome and the decision had to be set aside as erroneous in law (paragraph 17).

The claimant claimed a social fund funeral payment for his father's funeral. The Secretary of State refused his claim on the ground that he did not meet the ""qualifying benefit"" conditions in regulation 7(1)(a) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987. It was accepted that he met all the other conditions. The issue for the tribunal and the Commissioner was whether he satisfied the alternative condition in regulation 7(1)(a)(ii). This applies where a claimant for council tax benefit meets the conditions of entitlement for an award of alternative maximum council tax benefit in respect of the claimant for the funeral payment. The claimant was living as a non-dependant in the household of his cousin, who was liable for council tax. The claimant was not in receipt of any of the qualifying benefits listed in regulation 7(1)(a)(i), but his cousin would have been eligible for alternative maximum council tax benefit based on the claimant's income as a resident of the dwelling, had the cousin not been in receipt of council tax benefit under the main provisions. The tribunal confirmed the decision of the Secretary of State that the claimant did not satisfy regulation 7(1)(a)(ii), as there was no award of alternative maximum council tax benefit to his cousin.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	whereas regulation 7(1)(a)(i) refers to an award, regulation 7(1)(a)(ii) refers to the conditions of entitlement being fulfilled, and therefore does not require an award of alternative maximum council benefit to have been made;

2.	the cousin's underlying entitlement to that benefit in respect of him was therefore sufficient for the claimant to satisfy 7(1)(a)(ii);

3.	the claimant was therefore entitled to a funeral payment.

The claimant was in receipt of incapacity benefit and had an income from student lodgers. Regulation 16 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 provided that a claimant should be treated as capable of work, and therefore not entitled to incapacity benefit, on each day of every week during which he does any work, subject to exemptions set out in regulation 17. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner against the decision of an appeal tribunal that her earnings from self-employment exceeded the limit for exempt work set out in regulation 17. The Commissioner calculated the claimant’s earnings on a week-by-week basis rather than averaged over a one-year (or shorter) period as would have been required by the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996. He held that the Computation Regulations did not govern the calculation of the claimant’s earnings, since those regulations were for the calculation of earnings for the purposes of Parts II to V of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and regulations made under those parts of that Act and it was Part XIIA of the 1992 Act that provided for regulations to be made concerning capacity for work and under which the Incapacity for Work Regulations were made. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the Computation Regulations applied.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

It is Part II of the 1992 Act which by section 30A sets out incapacity for work as the essential ground of entitlement to incapacity benefit, while Part XIIA simply provides for the making of provision ancillary to Part II, and so the Computation Regulations apply to calculations for the purpose of that entitlement (paragraph 15).

The claimant had suffered from schizophrenia for many years and had difficulty in coping on his own. Towards the end of 2001 he inherited a sum of money that substantially exceeded the capital limit for housing benefit. He informed the local authority and his award of housing benefit was terminated. In May 2002 he made a further claim for housing benefit, stating that his capital had decreased to below the capital limit. Housing benefit was paid for five months, but then the local authority made enquiries and decided that he had deprived himself of capital totalling £68,845 for the purpose of securing entitlement to housing benefit. He therefore had to be treated as possessing capital in excess of £16,000 under regulation 43 Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 for the purposes of his claim from May 2002, with the result that there was no entitlement and he was legally liable to repay the amount already paid to him for that period. He appealed and his representative produced evidence of his psychiatric condition to the tribunal indicating that he was unlikely to have fully appreciated the potential implications of his behaviour. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that he was capable of managing his own affairs and of realising he was spending his money imprudently, and that a significant operative purpose of his expenditure was to secure entitlement to housing benefit. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the correct test to be applied in determining whether the claimant is shown to have deprived himself of capital for the purpose of securing entitlement to housing benefit is the well-established one applied on similar wording in the main social security legislation, namely whether the securing of such entitlement is shown to have been a “significant operative purpose” of the claimant’s relevant actions in disposing of his capital (paragraphs 20 to 23);

2.	the test of a claimant’s purpose in depriving himself of capital is a subjective one, depending on the evidence about the particular claimant in question and the tribunal had erred in concluding that because a person is not completely incapable of managing his affairs or of realising he was spending his money imprudently, it follows as a matter of course and without further analysis that all such spending is done for the purpose of securing entitlement to benefit (paragraph 13);

3.	the tribunal had also erred in failing to provide any breakdown or analysis of the actual amounts or occasions in respect of which the claimant was being found as a fact to have (a) deprived himself of capital and (b) done so for the purpose of obtaining benefit (paragraphs 15 to 18).

European Union Law - free movement of workers - discrimination by nationality 

The claimant was born in the United States and had dual Irish and American nationality. As part of his college studies, he spent one semester in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1978. In 1980 and 1981 he returned there for a stay of approximately ten months, during which he did part-time and casual work in pubs and bars and in sales. He went back to the United States in 1981. He subsequently worked in the United States and in Africa. He returned to the UK on 31 May 1998 in order to find work there in the social services sector. On 8 June 1998 he claimed income-based jobseeker’s allowance (JSA), which was refused, on the ground that he was not habitually resident in the UK. He appealed to an appeal tribunal, which upheld the refusal, stating that he could not be regarded as habitually resident in the UK since (1) he had not been resident for an appreciable time and (2) he was not a worker for the purposes of Regulation No 1612/68, nor did he have a right to reside in the UK pursuant to Directive 68/360. He appealed to the Commissioner, who referred the case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on questions of European law.

Held by the European Court of Justice that:
	
1.	a person in the circumstances of the claimant was not a worker for the purposes of Title II of Part I of Regulation No 1612/68, but it was for the national court or tribunal to establish whether the term “worker” as referred to by the national legislation at issue was to be understood in that sense (paragraphs 26 to 33);

2.	a person in the claimant’s position did not have a right to reside in the UK solely on the basis of Directive 68/360 (paragraphs 34 to 44);

3.	in view of the establishment of citizenship of the Union and the interpretation in the case-law of the right to equal treatment enjoyed by citizens of the Union, a habitual residence requirement can be justified only if it is based on objective considerations that are independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the national provisions (paragraphs 63 to 66); 

4.	it is legitimate for the national legislature to wish to ensure that there is a genuine link between an applicant for an allowance in the nature of a social advantage and the geographic employment market in question, and a residence requirement is, in principle, appropriate for the purpose of ensuring such a connection, although it must not exceed what is necessary in order for the national authorities to be able to satisfy themselves that the person concerned is genuinely seeking work in the employment market of the host Member State and its application by the national authorities must rest on clear criteria known in advance (paragraphs 67 to 72).

The Commissioner then issued his decision (not reproduced), holding that:

1.	the claimant’s position in 1998 was to be “compared with that of any national of a Member State looking for his first job in another Member State and therefore did not fall within the true meaning of the term “worker” in regulation 85(4)(a) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996;

2.	the residence test in the JSA legislation and in Article 10a of Regulation 1408/71 is justified by objective considerations independent of the nationality of the claimant and proportionate to the legitimate aim in the making of the JSA legislation, subject to the proviso that it cannot be applied to deny entitlement to benefit beyond the date at which the relevant national authority has become satisfied of the genuineness of the claimant’s search for work (paragraphs 31 to 47, reproduced at paragraph 44 of the Court of Appeal’s decision).

The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held by the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	the proper interpretation of the ECJ’s judgment was that, in the context of an application for an allowance in the nature of a social advantage, a requirement of a “genuine link” with the employment market may (subject always to questions of justification and proportionality) be legitimately imposed by a Member State in addition to an “actively seeking work” requirement (paragraphs 66 to 77);

2.	it followed that there was, in principle, scope for a residence test which imports factors which may be irrelevant to the question whether the search for work is genuine and it was clear from the ECJ judgment that in the context of JSA, the habitual residence test in regulation 85(4) is not incompatible with Community law (Swaddling v Adjudication Officer [1999] ECR I-1075 (also reported as R(IS) 6/99) and Nessa v Chief Adjudication Officer [1999] 1 WLR 1937 (also reported as R(IS) 2/00) cited) (paragraphs 78 to 85);

3.	a habitual residence test as the sole means of establishing the requisite “genuine link” between an applicant for JSA and the UK employment market is fully compatible with Community law and the proviso imposed in paragraph 45 of the Commissioner’s decision is not to be applied (paragraphs 86 to 88).

The claimant was receiving income support on the basis of incapacity for work. It was discovered that she had been working and a decision was made on behalf of the Secretary of State that she was to be treated as capable of work for a number of specified past periods. On the basis of that decision, which was not produced to the tribunal, a decision was made that she was not entitled to income support for specified periods and was entitled to reduced income support for other periods. Income support paid in excess of entitlement was determined to be recoverable because she had failed to disclose the material fact that she had been working. The claimant appealed the income support decisions to a tribunal and an appeal tribunal dismissed her appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the fact that a claimant no longer falls within one of the categories prescribed by Schedule 1B to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 for entitlement will not usually be a ground for superseding a decision awarding income support unless, on a balance of probabilities, he or she does not fall within any other prescribed category (paragraph 16);

2.	the circumstances prescribed by paragraph 8 and regulation 6(4)(a) of Schedule 1B (disabled workers) are such that decision-makers and appeal tribunals will usually need to give express consideration to it in cases where a claimant has been in receipt of income support on the basis that he or she is incapable of work and that benefit is then stopped on revision or supersession because the claimant is engaged in work which is not ""exempt work"" (paragraph 22);

3.	where the evidence suggests that another prescribed category may be relevant, then in the exercise of their inquisitorial jurisdiction, the tribunal must consider that possibility irrespective of whether it is also raised by either of the parties (Kerr v Department for Social Development (R 1/04 (SF)), R(IS) 11/99, CIS/1997/2002 followed) (paragraphs 25 to 28);  

4.	in the absence of evidence of the precise terms of the original decision of the incapacity benefit decision-maker it would be difficult for the Secretary of State to show that the income support decision had been correctly superseded (paragraphs 30 to 35).

The claimant was the leasehold owner of a flat in a complex of sheltered accommodation. The leaseholders were obliged to pay a service charge which covered services in respect of the buildings, gardens and ground as well as personal and communal services provided by the ground landlord. By paragraph 17 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 service charges are eligible housing costs subject to certain deductions, which include any amount for repairs and improvements, as defined in paragraph 16(2) of that Schedule, to the building of which the dwelling forms a part and any charges not connected with the provision of adequate accommodation. The claimant’s claim for income support included an amount representing 20 per cent of the salary bill and staff advertising costs of the management company. The decision-maker disallowed those costs on the ground that it had not been demonstrated that that proportion of the costs was connected with the provision of adequate accommodation. The claimant appealed and an appeal tribunal allowed her appeal, accepting the estimate of 20 per cent based on job descriptions of the staff. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner. At issue before the Commissioner was the correct apportionment of salary and administration costs and also whether the part of the service charge attributable to the reserve fund for future maintenance was eligible or excluded as falling within paragraph 16(2).
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no adequate evidential basis for the tribunal’s finding that 20 per cent was the proportion of staff costs attributable to provision of accommodation. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate assessment of that proportion, it was necessary to establish the number of hours per week spent by the employees in providing those services (paragraphs 27 and 28);
2.	Kerr v The Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL 23 (also reported as R(SF) 1/04) did not relieve the claimant from the duty to provide evidence of what service charges were deductible and was not authority for the tribunal to award benefit in default of proper investigation by the Secretary of State (paragraphs 29 and 30);
3.	in the absence of sufficiently detailed evidence of the amount of time devoted by staff to accommodation-related services the tribunal should have adjourned the hearing for the claimant’s representative to supply the Secretary of State with the necessary information about staff activity (paragraph 30);
4.	the cost of repairs or improvements to the fabric of the claimant’s own dwelling or the building of which it forms part were not deductible under paragraph 17(2) from the service charge (paragraphs 36 and 41);
5.	none of the contingencies itemised in the reserve fund schedule corresponded to the paragraph 16(2) list of what was deductible in terms of paragraph 17(2) and in any case what was deductible was the current or recent capital cost of works described in paragraph 16(2) incurred within the time prescribed by paragraph 16(1), not the claimant’s current contributions to a reserve against such capital costs in the future (paragraphs 39 to 43).
The Commissioner directed the Secretary of State to re-assess the claimant’s housing costs in the light of paragraphs 27 to 47 of his decision.

In 1998 the claimant was awarded the lowest rate of the care component of disability living allowance for life by a decision of an appeal tribunal (Decision 1). In December 2003 a decision was made (Decision 2) superseding Decision 1 on the ground of a change of circumstances, namely a deterioration in the claimant’s condition following a stroke, and awarding the higher rate of the mobility component and the middle rate of the care component until October 2005. In February 2004, following receipt of a report from the claimant’s consultant, a decision was made (Decision 3) superseding Decision 2 on the ground of ignorance as to material fact and removing entitlement to the higher rate of the mobility component and the middle rate of the care component with effect from 19 February 2004. The lowest rate of the care component was left on foot, but only until 2 October 2005. The claimant appealed. The appeal tribunal disallowed her appeal against Decision 3, and also removed entitlement to the lowest rate of the care component with effect from the date of its decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The question for the Commissioner was whether the tribunal could properly remove the award of the lowest rate of the care component, which had been made by Decision 1, without considering whether there was a ground to supersede Decision 1 which would lead to that result. The Secretary of State submitted that the tribunal did not need to be concerned with Decision 1 because that was not under appeal to it.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

The tribunal’s decision was erroneous in law in failing to consider whether there were grounds to supersede Decision 1 for the following reasons:

1.	if the mistake of fact had been a ground for a revision of Decision 2 rather than a supersession, it would have been clear that the question for the Decision 3 decision-maker (and therefore the tribunal on appeal) was what decision should have been made instead of Decision 2 (paragraph 16);

2.	(following R(IB) 2/04) a decision can only be superseded if there is a ground for supersession and that ground forms the basis of the supersession decision in the sense that the original decision can only be altered in a way which follows from that ground (paragraph 19);

3.	supersession on the ground of ignorance or mistake of fact has a very close affinity with revision and the effect of superseding Decision 2 on that ground is in substance to require the Decision 3 decision-maker (or tribunal on appeal from Decision 3) to ask what decision should be made instead of the mistaken Decision 2; unless the answer to that question is that Decision 1 ought to be superseded so as to remove even that award, then the award which had been made by Decision 1 should be left on foot (paragraph 20);

4.	it would be anomalous if a revision were more advantageous to the claimant in this respect than a supersession  (paragraph 21).

The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for determination.

Tribunal practice – evidence of children

The claimant, who was 12 years old, made a claim through her appointee for disability living allowance, identifying her disabilities as learning difficulties and behavioural problems. The claim was refused and she appealed. The appeal tribunal adjourned the hearing and gave a direction requiring the claimant to attend. Representations were made in response to the direction, supported by evidence from a clinical psychologist, stating that it would be inappropriate and potentially damaging for the claimant to attend the tribunal and that the Director of Social Services would be unlikely to give permission for her to attend. The child did not attend the adjourned hearing. The tribunal considered evidence from the claimant’s foster carer, her school and a clinical psychologist, and found that she did not need substantially more supervision than another child of her age. They dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State supported the appeal on the basis that the tribunal had failed to establish whether the claimant had a disability since there was no medical diagnosis of general or specific learning difficulties. Both section 72(1) (care component) and section 73(1)(d) (lower rate mobility component) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 require the claimant to be “so severely disabled physically or mentally” that certain consequences follow. A Tribunal of Commissioners was directed to consider the meaning of that phrase, particularly as applied to children with learning difficulties, and also the proper approach to children giving evidence in proceedings before appeal tribunals. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	conceptually and in ordinary language “disability” is distinct from “medical condition” and is entirely concerned with a deficiency in functional ability, ie the physical and mental power to do things (paragraph 35);

2.	the provisions of sections 72 and 73(1)(d) cannot require that “so severely disabled” means “having a serious medical condition” since otherwise they could not achieve their purpose of correlating entitlement to care needs (paragraph 36);

3.	if there had been an intention to require proof of a diagnosed or diagnosable medical condition, then the provisions could have made this clear, as they do in other benefit contexts (paragraph 37);

4.	for the relevant provisions to apply, the claimant must lack the physical or mental power to perform or control the relevant function and where it is not in the claimant’s power to avoid certain behaviour he will be “disabled” within the terms of sections 72 and 73(1)(d) (paragraphs 38 to 39);

5.	it is clearly apparent from the language of the provisions itself that the severity of the disability is to be measured solely by reference to the prescribed consequences, and that there is no room for any free-standing test of severity (paragraph 41);

6.	the tribunal’s power to require the attendance of a child to give evidence should be exercised with great care and caution having regard to the welfare of the child and the possible unreliability of the child’s evidence (tribunal Benchbook commended and additional guidance given) (paragraphs 52 to 58);

7.	in the present case the approach of the tribunal in summonsing the child to give evidence and then in drawing an adverse inference from the fact that she did not attend was inappropriate and unlawful as breaching the claimant’s right to a fair hearing (paragraphs 59 and 60).

The Commissioners remitted the case for rehearing by a differently constituted tribunal.

The claimant attained the age of 60 in July 2000 and, had he claimed in time, would have been entitled to winter fuel payments in respect of the winters 2000 onwards. The time limit for each winter was 31 March in the following year. However, the claimant did not make any claim until July 2004. A decision was made that he was not entitled to a winter fuel payment in respect of the winters 2000, 2001, 2002 or 2003, on the ground that his claim was too late. The claimant appealed. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, holding that there was no discretion to waive the time limit by which a claim had to be made. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Regulation 4(1) of the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations gives the Secretary of State a power to make a payment within the same time limit to a person who appears from official records to be entitled, without a claim having been made. The issue for the Commissioner was whether the tribunal had jurisdiction to consider whether the Secretary of State should have exercised that power.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

(following CIS/2337/2004, CIS/4792/2002 and CIS/4856/2002) the tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on whether the Secretary of State should have exercised his discretion to make a payment, since under section 12(1) of the Social Security Act 1998 a tribunal only has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against certain ""decisions"" of the Secretary of State and there was no decision, before

In 1999, on reaching the age of 60, the claimant claimed and was paid a Category A state retirement pension based on her own national insurance contributions, which was at less than the full rate. On 8 January 2002, her husband became 65, and claimed and was paid a Category A state retirement pension based on his contributions. That had the effect that the claimant fulfilled the conditions in section 48A of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (the 1992 Act) for entitlement to a Category B pension. Section 51A of the 1992 Act provides that, where there is entitlement to both Category A and Category B pension, the Category A pension will be increased to the level of the Category B pension. Section 43 of the 1992 Act gives the claimant in those circumstances the right to choose whether to receive the Category B pension or the increased Category A pension. The claimant claimed an increase to her pension in March 2004. The increase was awarded from three months before the date of that new claim. The claimant contended, on appeal to the tribunal, that she was not required to make a fresh claim in order to obtain an increase in her Category A retirement pension, and so should have been awarded the increase from 8 January 2002, the date on which she had fulfilled the conditions of entitlement. The tribunal dismissed the appeal. 

The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State relied on Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Nelligan (R(P) 2/03), where the Court of Appeal held that a married person who is entitled to a Category A pension by reference to his or her own contributions, but who subsequently becomes entitled to a Category B pension under section 48A of the 1992 Act by reference to a spouse's contributions, must make a separate claim for the Category B pension. However, that case did not deal directly with the position where a claimant elects, or is awarded in default of election, a Category A pension increased under section 51A.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	a claimant's entitlement to an increased Category A pension depends on entitlement to the Category B pension, for which, as was held in Nelligan, a separate claim must have been made (paragraph 11);

2.	the fact that there is no separate claim form does not prevent a claim being made on whatever form is prescribed (paragraph 12);

3.	technically the correct method of awarding an increase of a Category A pension under section 51A is by way of supersession, but the date from which such a supersession operates would be, at the earliest, the date of the relevant change of circumstances, that being the date of entitlement to an increased Category A pension, which requires a claim for Category B pension to have been made  (paragraph 12).",1,262,,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support and housing and council tax benefit. He married a woman of Thai nationality whose leave to remain in the United Kingdom was subject to a condition that she neither worked nor had recourse to public funds. She had been wrongly advised not to apply for a national insurance number. The claimant himself had a national insurance number and was a British national. The claimant notified the fact of his marriage to the local authority, and in due course the authority issued a form to the Department for Work and Pensions for allocation of a national insurance number to the claimant’s wife. She indicated that she did not at that stage wish to have a national insurance number. The authority then terminated the award of housing and council tax benefit on the ground that the claimant’s wife did not meet the condition of section 1(1B) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which requires that a national insurance number be allocated or that an application be made for a national insurance number, accompanied by sufficient information for one to be issued. Section (1)1A applies that requirement to both the claimant and “any other person in respect of whom [the claimant] is claiming benefit”, but that term is not defined. The claimant appealed and an appeal tribunal allowed his appeal on the ground that the claimant was not making a claim on his wife’s behalf, and that her national insurance number was irrelevant. The authority appealed to the Commissioner and the Secretary of State was joined as a party. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal, holding that where a claimant’s partner is not allowed by law to have recourse to public funds, she is not “a person in respect of whom he is claiming benefit” for the purposes of section 1(1A) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 in relation to a claim for housing benefit and that the requirement of section 1(1B) does not have to be satisfied in relation to her. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as a matter of ordinary language, benefit is claimed “in respect of” a person if the benefit claimed is referable in some way to that person, and it is so referable on a claim to housing benefit by a member of a couple, since the partner is taken into account in the quantification of the benefit to the extent that the outcome is the same whichever member of the couple makes the claims (paragraphs 28 to 32);
2.	the above applied equally where a claimant was on income support and there was no separate housing benefit calculation, because the calculation for income support would take account of the claimant’s partner in the same way (paragraphs 33 and 34);
3.	even though the claimant’s partner was taken into account in the calculation of benefit, her status as a person from abroad meant that this did not lead to any increase in the amount of benefit actually paid and so there was no recourse to public funds (paragraph 40);
4.	it followed that the national insurance number requirement had to be satisfied in respect of the claimant’ partner as well as himself (paragraph 42);

The claimant was convicted of the manslaughter of his wife on the ground of diminished responsibility and the court imposed a hospital order. As her widower, he was entitled to additional graduated retirement benefit, unless precluded by the forfeiture rule. The Secretary of State referred to the Commissioner under section 4(1) of the Forfeiture Act 1982 the questions whether the forfeiture rule applied and, if so, whether its effect should be modified.  In R(G) 3/84 a Commissioner had held that the forfeiture rule did not necessarily apply in a case where a hospital order had been imposed following a conviction for manslaughter based on diminished responsibility. 

Held that:

1.	the forfeiture rule applied in all cases where a Commissioner was satisfied that the claimant was guilty of manslaughter, even if the claimant had been acquitted in a crown court: Dunbar v Plant [1998] Ch 412 applied; R(G) 3/84 not followed; (paragraph 15);

2.	(obiter) it might be possible for a Commissioner to be satisfied that a finding by a crown court that a person was guilty of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility was, on the facts of the case, inappropriate and that a finding that he was not guilty by reason of insanity would have been more appropriate (paragraph 16);

3.	when deciding whether the forfeiture rule should be modified, the culpability of the claimant was the paramount consideration but, in the present case, while the claimant's culpability was low, the forfeiture rule did not act harshly and its effect would not be modified (paragraph 17).",1,298,,,

The claimant was in receipt of income support as a lone parent. In July 2003 the Secretary of State made a decision that she had been living with a Mr F as husband and wife. The claimant did not appeal against that decision. No decision was made to alter her entitlement to income support for past periods but in November 2003 a decision was made that as a result of the July decision a recoverable overpayment had been made between 1992 and 1997. The claimant appealed against that decision. The appeal tribunal found that she had been living with Mr F as husband and wife. It identified the July 2003 decision as defective, but held, relying on R(IB) 2/04, that it could remedy the defects and proceed on the basis that there had been a valid supersession. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the July 2003 decision did not purport to alter the claimant's entitlement to income support at all, but was simply one building block that might, with other determinations, have built to a decision altering her entitlement (CIS/1720/2004 followed) (paragraph 9);

2.	that decision could not therefore satisfy the condition in section 71(5A) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 that there must be a valid revision or supersession decision as a basis for a decision that an overpayment is recoverable (paragraph 10);

3.	as a mere building block, the July 2003 decision was not strictly a decision at all and in itself was not defective, but had so little connection to the legal powers to alter the claimant's entitlement  as to be incapable of correction by the tribunal so as to have that effect (paragraph 13);

In 1994, on reaching the age of 60, the claimant was awarded a Category A state retirement pension based on her own national insurance contributions, which was at less than the full rate. In October 1999, her husband became 65 and was also awarded a Category A state retirement pension based on his contributions. The claimant then became entitled to elect whether to receive a category B retirement pension by reference solely to her husband’s contributions or a category A retirement pension increased by reference to her husband’s contributions. However, it was necessary for her to make a separate claim for either of these benefits (Secretary of State v Nelligan [2003] EWCA Civ 555 (R(P) 2/03), applied in R(P) 1/05). The claimant claimed an increased category A retirement pension on 25 October 2001. The prescribed time for claiming retirement pension of any category was three months beginning with any day on which, apart from satisfying the condition of making a claim, the claimant is entitled to the retirement pension. The increased pension was therefore awarded from 25 July 2001. The claimant appealed against the application of the time limit on the grounds that she had not been advised of her entitlement. The tribunal dismissed her appeal. On her appeal to the Commissioner it was argued on her behalf that the three months time limit was contrary to Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (non-deprivation of possessions) and that the fact that the claimant had not been advised of her right to claim an increased pension constituted discrimination contrary to Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of the First Protocol.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	(following Carson and Reynolds [2003] EWCA Civ 797, [2003] 3 All ER 577) Article 1 of the First Protocol does not apply where the reason why the claimant was not entitled to a pension was that she did not satisfy the conditions of entitlement under domestic law (paragraphs 12 and 13;

2.	there was no evidence that the claimant was not informed of her entitlement as the result of any form of discrimination which could found the basis of a complaint under Article 14 and even if there had been such evidence, it was difficult to see what remedy the Commissioner could have granted under the Human Rights Act 1998 (paragraph 14).

The claimant was illiterate but had no other disability. His wife completed his claim form for income support in his presence. The section of the form relating to partner’s income was left blank through an oversight. The claimant took the form to the local benefits office, where a member of staff confirmed it had been completed correctly and the claimant then signed it beside the declaration that the information on the form was correct and complete. Income support was awarded on the basis of that information but was subsequently determined to have been overpaid because his wife’s retirement pension had not been taken into account. A decision was made that the overpayment was recoverable from the claimant because he had misrepresented, by signing the declaration, that the information given was complete. His appeal against that decision was dismissed by two appeal tribunals. On his second appeal to a Commissioner it was argued on his behalf that the overpayment was not recoverable because (a) the claimant was under a disability, namely illiteracy, and mistook the nature of the document so that the doctrine of non est factum applied to relieve him of liability (b) it was not possible for there to be an innocent misrepresentation by omission and the case was one of innocent failure to disclose (c) (citing CIS/222/1991) there was an ambiguity in the claim form as presented and therefore a duty on the adjudication officer to investigate further, and the failure to investigate was the cause of the overpayment rather than any misrepresentation on the part of the claimant. It was accepted by the Secretary of State that the misrepresentation was innocent.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	even if the doctrine of non est factum applied to social security, which was doubtful, there was no evidence that the form was fundamentally different from the form the claimant thought he was signing and he could reasonably have taken precautions to ascertain its contents and significance (Lloyds Bank plc v Waterhouse [1993] 2 FLR 97 followed) (paragraphs 9 to 23);

2.	there is a difference between acting deliberately and acting dishonestly or fraudulently and it is possible for a claimant to make an innocent misrepresentation by omission (paragraphs 30 and 31);

3.	the language of the declaration signed by the claimant could not be read other than as a guarantee that the form had been completed in a way that accurately set out all details that might affect entitlement to the benefit claimed and hence as a misrepresentation and not a failure to disclose (Chief Adjudication Officer v Sherriff (reported as R(IS) 14/96) followed) (paragraph 39);

4.	in the present case there was no ambiguity or contradiction in the information in the claim form as there was in CIS/222/1991, but simply an incompleteness which did not require further investigation by the adjudication officer before deciding the claim and (following Duggan v Chief Adjudication Officer (reported as the Appendix to R(SB) 13/89)) any failure to investigate by the decision-maker did not relieve the claimant of responsibility for the overpayment (paragraphs 42 to 47).",1,231,234,,

The claimant appealed against a supersession decision on his capacity for work following a medical examination by an approved doctor who produced an electronic IB85 report. The claimant challenged the validity of the report as evidence on the ground that it was not signed. The tribunal dismissed his appeal. The Commissioner granted leave to appeal in the light of the decision in CIB/3984/2004, where it was held that an unsigned electronic medical report which was challenged was only competent evidence if it was certified in accordance with section 7 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000.

Held dismissing the appeal, that:

2.	in proceedings to which the strict rules of evidence apply, section 7 allows an electronic signature to be authenticated by means of a certificate in the prescribed form; however, it does not lay down a procedure which is to be used in every case where the authenticity of an electronic document or of electronic data is in dispute (paragraphs 9 and 10);

3.	however, even assuming that the electronic form IB85 did contain an electronic signature, section 7 has no application to tribunals constituted under the Social Security Act 1998, since the strict rules of evidence do not apply to proceedings before those tribunals (paragraph 11).",1,148,,,

The three claimants were former long-term hospital patients who were placed in nursing homes under arrangements whereby the health authority channelled payments via the local authority to the homes to make up the fees that the claimants could not pay through disability living allowance and income support. The claimants appealed against decisions to maintain the suspension of the payment of the care component of disability living allowance under regulation 9 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991, which provided for suspension where accommodation was provided by a local authority under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948. The tribunal allowed the appeals on the ground that it was more probable than not that the claimants’ accommodation was provided under powers contained in provisions other than Part III of the 1948 Act. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioners and argued that if, as had been suggested in the evidence before the tribunal, the payments made by the health authority to the local authority were made under section 28A of the National Health Service Act 1977, the subsequent payments made by the local authority to the nursing homes must have been made under Part III of the 1948 Act and that, in any event, the other powers identified by the tribunal had not been available to the local authority. The health authority was invited to make submissions on the appeals and conceded that at all material times it had been responsible for the care of the claimants because of their substantial nursing needs.  It argued that it had not made payments to the local authority under section 28A of the 1977 Act but had merely used the local authority as a conduit for payments to the nursing home under sections 3 and 23 of that Act. The Tribunal of Commissioners raised the question whether regulations 8 and 12A of the 1991 Regulations had to be considered.  Those regulations provided for the suspension of payment of, respectively, the care component and the mobility component of disability living allowance where the claimant was being “maintained free of charge while undergoing medical or other treatment as an in-patient – (a) in a hospital or similar institution under the NHS Act of 1977 …”.  The health authority argued that the claimants were not being “maintained” in the nursing homes because the health authority paid only the nursing costs and the nursing homes charged the claimants for their accommodation an amount they could pay from their benefits.

Held, allowing the appeals, that:

1.	the tribunal had erred in not considering the relationship between section 28A of the 1977 Act and Part III of the 1948 Act and in not considering the limited extent of the alternative powers it had identified (paragraphs 47 to 54);

2.	as the responsibility for providing the accommodation remained with the health authority, the arrangements for the accommodation were not made by the local authority under Part III of the 1948 Act but by the health authority under sections 3 and 23 of the 1977 Act and so regulation 9 of the 1991 Regulations did not apply (paragraph 61);

3.	however, regulation 8 had to be considered because a nursing home could be a “hospital”, a person who had severe learning difficulties and was consequently receiving nursing care was “undergoing medical or other treatment” and the words “under the NHS Act 1977” qualified the words “maintained free of charge while undergoing medical or other treatment as an in-patient” rather than describing the “hospital or similar institution” (paragraph 64);

4.	where regulation 8 was capable of applying, it required that a claimant was to be treated as “maintained free of charge … under the NHS Act 1977” if any part of the total cost of accommodation and nursing was met under the 1977 Act, subject to specified exceptions (paragraph 72);

5.	regulation 8 could not apply if nursing care provided under the 1977 Act was merely incidental or ancillary to the provision of accommodation so that the need for nursing care would be consistent with accommodation being provided by a local authority under Part III of the 1948 Act, but it did apply where the amount of nursing care provided implied a duty on a health authority also to make accommodation available under the 1977 Act (paragraph 75);

6.	in the present cases, the health authority had a duty under the 1977 Act to arrange for accommodation to be provided to the claimants free of charge and, therefore, regulation 8 required payment of the care component to remain suspended and, subject to transitional provisions which applied to two of the claimants, regulation 12A required payment of the mobility component to be suspended as well (paragraphs 81 to 84).

The claimant was employed for three days a week in seasonal employment. Each new contract was discrete and he applied for employment each year His contract of employment for 2002 was terminated on 2 November 2002 and he claimed jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). Regulation 52(3) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (the Regulations) provides that a person is to be treated as in remunerative work, and hence not entitled to JSA, during a period for which certain earnings, including holiday pay paid not more than four weeks after termination of employment, are taken into account. The decision-maker obtained information from his employer that he was entitled to 12.2 days holiday pay and decided that they were to be attributed to his working days only, disentitling him until 25 December 2002. The claimant appealed. He produced evidence to the tribunal that he had in fact been paid 11.115 days holiday pay on 29 November 2002, but the tribunal proceeded on the basis of the entitlement notified by the employer of 12.2 days (to be rounded up to 13 under regulation 94(5) of the Regulations) and decided that the holiday pay was to be taken into account over a period of four weeks and one day. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner the Secretary of State raised the issue of whether, irrespective of the holiday pay issue, the claimant should be considered as remaining in remunerative work under regulation 51 of the Regulations, as he remained within a “recognisable cycle of work”. However, the main issue for the Commissioner was the period over which the holiday pay should be calculated under the provisions of regulation 94(2)(a) of the Regulations.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	(following (R(JSA) 5/03) the claimant was not to be considered as remaining within a “recognisable cycle of work” under regulation 51 as there was no express arrangement or longstanding practice to found an expectation that he would resume employment in the following year (paragraphs 9 to 11);

2.	regulation 52(3) clearly refers to earnings that are paid, not to which there is an entitlement, and the tribunal had erred in taking into account the employer’s calculation of his holiday pay rather than the amount he actually received (paragraph 21); 

3.	regulation 94(2)(a) provides for the calculation of a weekly amount by applying the formula in regulation 97(1)(b)(iv) of the regulations, and to calculate that by reference to the claimant’s working days produced a result that was artificial, less workable and harsh in its effect (following CJSA/3438/1998 in preference to CJSA/4508/1998) (paragraph 22);

4.	the claimant was therefore to be treated as in remunerative employment for 12 consecutive days until 9 December 2002.

The claimant was a Dutch national who had not worked in any Member State of the European Union. She came to the United Kingdom in August 2003 and claimed income support 11 weeks later. Her claim was refused on the ground that she was not habitually resident in the United Kingdom. She appealed and an appeal tribunal dismissed her appeal. She appealed to the Commissioner, who raised the question of whether she was entitled to the benefit of Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 on special non-contributory benefits and a test of (habitual) residence under which length of residence could not be a conclusive factor (Swaddling v Adjudication Officer (Case C-90/97) ECR [1997] I-1075, R(IS) 6/99). The claimant stated she had been in receipt of the equivalent of child benefit and possibly income support in the Netherlands. Those benefits were payable in her case on the basis of legal residence only. The main question on the appeal was whether entitlement on that basis brought her within the personal scope of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 as an employed or self-employed person subject to the social security legislation of the Netherlands (Article 2(1)). Article 1(a)(ii) of the Regulation includes in the definition of “employed or self-employed person” any person who is compulsorily insured under a social security scheme, provided the person can be identified as an employed or self-employed person by virtue of the manner in which the scheme is administered or financed. It was argued for the claimant, citing Sürül v Bundesanstalt für Arbeit (Case C-292/96) [1999] ECR I-2685 and other authorities, that that test had been overtaken by the need to apply fundamental principles of EC law to the increasing prevalence of non-contributory benefits. It was further argued that the domestic habitual residence test discriminated against the claimant on the ground of nationality.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	as “insured” in Article 1(a) must include a situation where qualification for benefit depends on residence, the claimant was compulsorily insured for the contingencies of family benefits and old-age benefits under social security schemes for all residents but the question remained whether she could be “identified as an employed or self-employed person by virtue of the manner in which the scheme is administered or financed” (paragraphs 12 and 13);
2.	taking account of the contexts and of the specific references to the conditions mentioned in Article 1(a), none of the apparently very broad statements of principle in the authorities cited deprived the proviso to Article 1(a)(ii) of its force and effect. Merely having been subject to the social security legislation of one or more Member States did not necessarily bring a person within the personal scope of Regulation 1408/71 and the existing personal scope continued to apply (paragraph 15);
3.	the making of contributions as an employed person to a scheme and entitlement depending to some extent on having made contributions are important factors in applying the proviso to Article 1(a)(ii), without ruling out other ways of identifying a person as an employed (or now self-employed) person and there was nothing in the administration or financing of the Dutch social security scheme to identify the claimant  as an employed or self-employed person (Brack v Insurance Officer (Case 17/76) [1976] ECR 1429, Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie d’Eure-et-Loir v Tessier (Case 84/77) [1978] ECR 7 considered) (paragraph 21);
4.	the domestic habitual residence test met the test of proportionality, so any discriminatory effect was objectively justified (Collins v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Case C-138/02) (now reported as R(JSA) 3/06) and R (on the application of Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing (Case C-209/03) followed) (paragraphs 30 and 31);
5.	the tribunal’s judgment in weighing up all the factors relevant to the domestic habitual residence test was well within the area of reasonableness given to it (paragraph 34).

A maintenance assessment under the old child support scheme was in force in favour of the mother. She had the assessment cancelled and waited 13 weeks before applying for a maintenance calculation under the new scheme, introduced by the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, which would give her a higher rate of maintenance. The father applied for a maintenance assessment within the 13-week period. If this application were accepted, maintenance would be calculated under the old scheme under the phasing-in provisions for the new scheme. The father’s application had not been processed before the mother’s application was received. The Secretary of State calculated the maintenance liability under the new scheme by reference to the mother’s application, relying on paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 3 to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculation Procedure) Regulations 2000, which provides that, where applications under the new scheme are received from both parents, that of the parent with care takes precedence. The father appealed to a tribunal, contending that his liability should have been calculated under the old scheme by reference to his application. The tribunal allowed his appeal, referring to paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 2, rather than Schedule 3, and holding that it applied only where two applications had been received “more or less” at the same time, because it was inequitable to apply it where the Secretary of State had failed to act on an application by the father received five weeks before the mother’s application. The mother appealed to the Commissioner. The Secretary of State supported the appeal, relying again on Schedule 3. The father relied on regulation 4(3), which refers only to Schedule 2, for the contention that the earlier application should take precedence. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it was unnecessary to decide which of Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 applied because, even if Schedule 2 applied, regulation 4(3) had no application in this case because it applied only to multiple applications by the same person and, due to the similarity between Schedule 2 and Schedule 3, they had to be given the same construction as each other (paragraph 12);
2.	it was clear that the policy intention of paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 2 was that the person with care should be able to make an application more advantageous to her than an undetermined application made earlier by the non-resident parent and therefore the tribunal’s qualification could not properly be implied into paragraph 3(2) of either Schedule (paragraph 13);
3.	if the Secretary of State had wished to provide that an application by a non-resident parent should be effective whether or not the person with care made a subsequent application, it would have been very easy so to provide but, as the legislation stood, the tribunal’s construction created anomalies rather than avoiding them (paragraph 14);
4.	the Child Support Agency had not been entitled deliberately to refuse to process the father’s application with a view to assisting the mother but, if it had done so, the remedy was not for the mother to be deprived of maintenance to which she was entitled but was for the father to obtain compensation from the Agency (paragraph 18).

The claimant applied for the interest on a loan to be included in the calculation of her income support. The Secretary of State decided that the loan was not for a qualifying purpose within paragraph 16 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, because it had been taken out for a purpose covered by paragraph 16(1)(c) but used for a purpose covered by paragraph 16(1)(a). A tribunal dismissed the claimant’s appeal. The issue before the Commissioner was whether a loan taken out for one qualifying purpose but used for another qualifying purpose was a qualifying loan under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 3.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the use of the word “purpose” in paragraph 16(1), by contrast with “purposes” in paragraph 15 strongly indicates that sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 16(1) are to be regarded as a single purpose (paragraph 14);

2.	provided both the initial purpose of the loan and the purpose for which it is used fall within paragraph 16(1), it is irrelevant that they are not the same (paragraph 15);

3.	the purposes for which the loan was taken out must be decided on all the evidence, and not just on the understanding of the lender (paragraph 18).

The Commissioner remitted the case to the Secretary of State to determine the extent to which the claimant was entitled to assistance with housing costs.

Tribunal practice - weighing evidence and fact-finding - function of appellate court

The claimant was in receipt of incapacity benefit. Following a personal capability assessment, a decision-maker superseded the award on the basis that the claimant no longer satisfied the test of incapacity for work. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, which considered a large body of evidence, including the claimant's oral evidence at the hearing, and upheld the decision to refuse incapacity benefit. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who held the appeal tribunal had made no error of law, and accordingly dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal it was argued on the claimant's behalf that the tribunal had failed in its duty to consider the case in sufficient detail, and that its decision was perverse in the light of previous favourable assessments of the claimant over seven years. Specifically it was suggested that the tribunal had misconstrued a letter from the claimant's GP, had failed to concentrate on the question of the pain he was said to suffer, and had asked the wrong question in relation to a hearing test. The court was invited to give guidance to tribunals on the proper weighing of evidence.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	in considering applications for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, Commissioners should bear in mind the guidance in Cooke v Secretary of State for Social Security [2002] 3 All ER 279, R(DLA) 6/01 and adopt a robust attitude to the prospect of success criterion; moreover the point of law sought to be raised should be identified in the application, which had not been done in this case (paragraph 2);

2.	all the points of law suggested  in the submissions in this case were questions of fact to be weighed by the tribunal and not matters for a Commissioner or court (paragraph 21);

3.	it was not the function of  the court to teach tribunals how to perform their function of weighing the evidence (paragraph 25);

4.	the tribunal's decision was supported by the evidence and was not perverse (paragraphs 24 and 34).",1,67,274,,

The parent with care appealed against the calculation of the non-resident parent’s maintenance liability, alleging that he had undeclared income. At the invitation of the Secretary of State and before the appeal was forwarded to the Appeals Service, the parent with care applied for a variation, repeating her allegations about the non-resident parent’s rental income and adding that he had a life-style inconsistent with his declared income. The Secretary of State then made a decision, worded as a rejection of the variation application under section 28B of the Child Support Act 1991. No new appeal was made following that decision, and the appeal against the maintenance calculation was forwarded to the Appeals Service. The tribunal allowed the appeal and agreed to a variation from the effective date of the maintenance calculation. The parent with care appealed to the Commissioner. Despite some procedural inconsistencies, the Commissioner accepted (paragraphs 21 to 22) the decision on the variation application as a rejection under section 28B. He identified a number of procedural matters with which the tribunal had failed to deal and in his decision explains the relationship between maintenance calculation and variation decisions under the reformed child support scheme and the powers of the Secretary of State and tribunals in such cases. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it would have been possible for the Secretary of State to treat the appeal as an application for a variation, but that power should be exercised with a greater degree of restraint in the child support jurisdiction than in the social security context (paragraphs 24 to 29);
2.	the tribunal’s choice of effective date implied that it implemented the variation by way of revision rather than supersession, but its failure to explain why it did so was an error of law (paragraphs 30 and 50);
3.	a decision under section 28B to reject an application for a variation made after a maintenance calculation decision is not a determination of the application and must be in the form of a decision to  revise or not revise or supersede or not supersede (paragraphs 33 to 36);
4.	a decision under section 28B in the form of a decision not to revise does not limit the scope of an appeal that has already been made (paragraphs 37 to 41);
5.	a tribunal has the power under section 20(8)(a) to substitute a decision based on a determination for a decision under section 28B and to substitute a supersession for a revision (R(IB) 2/04 followed) (paragraph 42);
6.	the tribunal erred in considering the parent with care’s evidence about the non-resident parent’s rental income as relevant only to a variation application, because it should have considered whether the properties were held by the non-resident parent as part of a trade or business (following R(FC) 2/92 and CCS/2128/2001), in which case they would fall within the main child support scheme as self-employed income (paragraphs 43 to 49).

The case came before the appeal tribunal on appeal by the parent with care. The key issue for the tribunal was whether the absent parent was living with Mr T as his partner. The parent with care provided evidence relating to Mr T and his relationship with the absent parent. The Child Support Agency masked parts of that evidence that would allow Mr T’s whereabouts to be identified and other parts that would not. Both parents attended the hearing of the appeal and gave evidence. The tribunal accepted the parent with care’s evidence and decided that the absent parent and Mr T were partners. It directed that her liability for child support maintenance be reassessed on that basis. The absent parent sought leave to appeal to a Commissioner. The Commissioner who granted leave to appeal raised the question of whether the masking of the evidence had prevented there being a fair hearing. Regulation 44 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, enacted under paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the Social Security Act 1998, allows a non-resident parent or a parent with care to elect that specified evidence must not be disclosed, ie (a) the address of the child, one of the parents, or a person with care of the child and (b) information that could reasonably be expected to lead to one of those persons being located.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the chairman of the tribunal has a duty to ensure that the parties have a fair hearing and that the regulation is implemented within its proper scope, as shown by the enabling legislation, which allows provision to be made for confidentiality  (paragraph 26);
2.	the information need not be kept confidential from the other parent in the proceedings if already known to that parent (paragraphs 30 and 31);
3.	there is no rule of law or practice that evidence can be withheld from the tribunal. It would be contrary to the very essence of the judicial process for a tribunal to come to a decision on an issue without seeing all the relevant evidence that was before it regardless of whether it was concealed from one of the parties by masking (paragraph 32);
4.	where masked papers are issued to the tribunal, the chairman should review the papers and  may direct that the parties and/or the tribunal be provided with unmasked copies of evidence relevant to the issues raised by the appeal (paragraphs 34 and 35);
5.	where evidence is properly masked under regulation 44 the chairman must ensure that there is a fair hearing despite the withholding of the evidence, by ensuring that each party has enough information to meet the other’s case (paragraphs 36 and 37);
6.	in the present case none of the masked evidence should have been withheld from the parties, but the chairman was still able to ensure a fair hearing and there was no breach of natural justice.

In both cases the claimants claimed entitlement to mobility component of disability living allowance on the basis of virtual inability to walk. In CDLA/2879/2004 the claimant contended that severe low back pain substantially limited his ability to walk. In CDLA/2899/2004 the claimant contended that severe vertigo and dizziness did so. In each case the appeal tribunal decided that the claimant was not entitled, on the ground in CDLA/2879/2004 that, even if there was something physically wrong with his back, there was no physical reason for the severe degree of pain that he experienced, and psychological problems might well be contributing to his walking difficulties, and in CDLA/2899/2004 on the ground that the claimant’s vertigo and dizziness did not have a physical cause, the implication being that these were psychological in origin. The claimants appealed to the Commissioner and the Chief Commissioner directed that, as the appeals raised issues of special legal difficulty on which there were divergent Commissioners’ decisions, they be dealt with by a Tribunal of Commissioners. Under section 73(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 a person qualifies for higher rate mobility component if he is suffering from physical disablement such that he is either unable to walk or virtually unable to do so and regulation 12 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 states that “a person is to be taken to satisfy that condition only in if his physical condition as a whole is such that … he is unable to walk … [etc]”. The submission for the claimants was that the restriction is to be defined in terms of the manifestation of the disability, while the Secretary of State contended that it is to be defined in terms of the cause of the disability, thereby restricting entitlement to the higher rate of the mobility component to cases in which the inability or virtual inability to walk has a physical (ie organic) cause.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that:

1.	in the absence of Harrison v Secretary of State for Social Services [1987] (reported as an Appendix to (R(M) 1/88)  the Tribunal of Commissioners would have considered the intention and effect of regulation 12(1)(a) to be that the inability or virtual inability to walk must be the result of an impairment of the claimant’s physical functional capacity and that it is not necessary for the claimant to show that the impairment has an identifiable physical cause (paragraphs 82 to 85);

2.	however, Harrison is binding authority that where a claimant suffers from physical symptoms or manifestations of a medical condition (whether that condition be physical or mental), it is necessary for him to show an identifiable physical cause for those symptoms or manifestations to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to higher rate mobility component of DLA under section 73(1)(a) of the 1992 Act and regulation 12 of the 1991 Regulations (paragraphs 86 to 101);

3.	in cases where a claimant’s inability or virtual inability to walk is caused by both physical and mental factors, the claimant is entitled to the higher rate of the mobility component if the physical disorder is a material cause – ie if its contribution to the inability or virtual inability to walk is more than minimal. The physical cause must be still current at the date of the decision-maker’s decision but it does not matter at what point in the chain of causation it comes (paragraphs 116 to 120);

4.	it may be that tribunals have in the past been too ready to conclude that the fact that no specific identifiable cause for lower back pain and dizziness has been found, despite extensive investigation, means that there is no physical cause (paragraphs 146 and 166);

5.	in CDLA/2879/2004 the tribunal had erred in assuming that where there is an underlying physical problem, any exacerbation of the pain by reason of psychological problems must be left out of account (paragraph 147);

6.	in CDLA/2899/2004 the tribunal had erred in failing to state what significance it attributed to medical opinions that the claimant was suffering from uncompensated peripheral vestibular disorder, in failing to consider, in the absence of a diagnosis of mental disorder, whether it was likely that the cause of the claimant’s physical symptoms was mental or psychological before concluding that those symptoms did not have an organic cause, and in failing to correctly identify the grounds for supersession of the existing award of higher rate mobility component (paragraphs 163 to 171).

Bereavement and death benefits – effect on entitlement when more than one surviving polygamously married widow 
Human rights – whether difference in treatment of polygamously married widows amounts to discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention
In all three cases all parties to the relevant marriages were born and all the marriages took place in what later became Bangladesh. All of the first marriages of the men were potentially polygamous and all of the second marriages of the men (to the claimants) were actually polygamous. All of the parties were domiciled in the place where the marriages took place and all of the marriages were legally recognised in the place of domicile. In each case the deceased husband had worked and had paid relevant national insurance contributions in the United Kingdom and, at the time of claiming, each claimant was resident in the United Kingdom. The appeals of the three claimants against decisions by the Secretary of State refusing widow’s benefits were heard by the same tribunal and dismissed on the grounds that in each case the claimant was polygamously married to her husband, that the marriages were recognised in English law, and that each marriage was actually polygamous at the date of the death of the husband in respect of whose contributions the claim to benefit had been made. The claimants appealed to the Commissioner. The Chief Commissioner directed that, as the appeals raised issues of special legal difficulty, they be dealt with by a Tribunal of Commissioners. It was agreed by the parties and accepted by the Commissioners that, following (Fuljan) Bibi v Chief Adjudication Officer [1998] 1 FLR 375 (also reported as R(G) 1/97), the cases were correctly decided under domestic law. The parties also agreed for the purposes of the appeal that the facts of the case came within the ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to respect for family life. The only issue before the Commissioners was whether the difference in treatment of monogamously married women and polygamously married women amounted to discrimination contrary to Article 14.  
Held, unanimously dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	(per the Chief Commissioner and Mr Howell) discrimination contravening Article 14 was not established in these cases because the factual difference of not having been the only surviving widow of a man was not a relevant distinction on grounds of status and failure to accord each claimant the same benefit in respect of her late husband as if she had been his sole widow did not raise any question of offending common human dignity and respect for the individual or the equal protection of Convention rights so as to require that factual difference to be excluded as “irrelevant” for Article 14 (paragraphs 57 to 59); 
2.	(per the Chief Commissioner and Mr Howell) if the failure to treat two situations alike is not discrimination because they are relevantly different, it must follow that no further justification or judicial evaluation of how differently the domestic law system happens to treat them is appropriate (paragraph 60);		
3.	(per Mr Levenson) there was difference in treatment on the basis of status, marriage being a legal status and marital status a personal characteristic, but discrimination contravening Article 14 was not established in these cases because it was legitimate in the current context of social and cultural life in the United Kingdom for the State to favour monogamy over polygamy, the methods chosen to do so were proportionate and the difference was not on a “suspect” ground of the kind envisaged by the House of Lords in Carson	[2005] UKHL 37, [2005] WLR 1369 (paragraphs 65 to 68 and 77 to 79).

The claimant was separated from his wife. At the time of his claim for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) his two children resided with him for roughly half the week, but the mother was in receipt of child benefit in respect of both children. The adjudication officer decided that the claimant was entitled to income-based JSA, but that the amount payable should not include any additional amount in respect of the children, because he was not in receipt of child benefit and was therefore not to be treated as responsible for them by the definition in regulation 77(1) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (the JSA Regulations). The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, which upheld the adjudication officer's decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner and the Court of Appeal, arguing that the statutory provisions linking increases in respect of children to receipt of child benefit favoured mothers over fathers and therefore contravened the anti-discrimination conditions in Directive 79/7/EEC. The Court of Appeal found that income-based JSA was within the scope of the Directive (see R(JSA) 1/05) but remitted the case to the Commissioner to consider the issue of discrimination. 
The Commissioner held that regulation 77 was indirectly discriminatory and not objectively justifiable in so far as (in regulation 77) it linked entitlement to increases in respect of children to receipt of child benefit, but held that the regulation was not indirectly discriminatory and/or was objectively justifiable in so far as it provided (in regulation 77(5)) that only one person could be eligible for the increases in respect of any child in any week and (in regulation 77(3)(a)) that, in the absence of a claim for child benefit, the person entitled to the premium should be the person with whom the child usually lives. The claimant again appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Secretary of State cross-appealed, arguing that the Commissioner's decision should be upheld on additional grounds.

Held, allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that:

1.	paragraphs (3)(a) and (5) of regulation 77 in the context of regulation 77 as a whole discriminate against men since they are inextricably linked to the discrimination against men in regulation 77(1) and prevent appropriate subsistence being paid to substantial minority carers (paragraphs  68 to 71, 100 and 152 to 155);

2.	in creating a scheme which forced parents to live substantially below subsistence level and failing to explore alternatives that might achieve his legitimate aim with the necessary balance of fairness and efficiency, the Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of establishing justification (R v Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith (Case C-167/97) [1999] ECR I-623 followed) (paragraphs 47, 63,113, 168 and 171)

3.	the effect of the Directive was that the offending parts of regulation 77 could not be applied to the claimant or to others in his position, although they remained applicable where they did not operate in a discriminatory fashion (paragraph 77);

4.	the Apportionment Act 1870 did not apply to the case and the result of the disapplication of regulation 77 was that the claimant was entitled under section 35 of the Jobseekers Act 1995 to the full increase to his income-based JSA in respect of the children (paragraphs 92, 125 to 26, 178 and 195 to 200).

The claimant was in receipt of income support. In May 2001 he claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit. The claim was incomplete and he re-submitted it in June 2001, with a covering letter, stating he no longer wished to claim housing benefit. In July 2001 an investigating officer from the local authority visited the claimant and questioned him about capital from the sale of his wife’s property. The claimant refused to answer any questions about his wife. Later the same day the claimant wrote to the investigating officer, withdrawing his claim. The local authority informed the Benefits Agency, which decided that he was not entitled to income support after the sale of the house and that income support paid since that date was overpaid and recoverable. The claimant appealed against the income support decisions and in December 2003 an appeal tribunal allowed his appeal, finding that the capital resulting from the sale of the house was exempt capital. The claimant informed the local authority of the tribunal decision and sought to have his claim of June 2001 reinstated on the ground that he had withdrawn the claim under duress. The local authority refused to reinstate his claim and the claimant appealed. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, holding that, by withdrawing his claim, the claimant had prevented it from being reconsidered after the outcome of his income support claim became known. The Commissioner granted leave to appeal because he considered it arguable that the tribunal ought to have considered whether (in the light of CJSA/3979/1999 and CDLA/1589/1999) the withdrawal of the claim following the investigation interview should be treated as a genuine expression of the claimant’s intention to do so. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	regulation 74 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 provides for the amendment or withdrawal of a claim by a claimant at any time before it is decided and therefore the effect of the covering letter sent by the claimant in June 2001 was to amend the claim so as to claim only council tax benefit (paragraph 8);

2.	the letter sent by the claimant following the interview with the investigating officer constituted an unambiguous and unequivocal notice of withdrawal of the remaining council tax benefit claim for the purposes of regulation 64 of the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations, which is in the same terms as regulation 74 of the 1987 Regulations (paragraph 8);

3.	although in some cases it will be possible to make a fresh claim which can be backdated to cover the period of a claim which has been withdrawn, the consequence of a genuine and effective withdrawal is, in the absence of any provision permitting reinstatement, to prevent any award from being made on the claim after the withdrawal took effect (R v Hampstead and St Pancras Rent Tribunal ex parte Goodman [1951] 1 KB 541; Boal Quay Wharfingers Limited v Kings Lynn Conservancy Board [1971] 1 WLR 1558; Rydqvist v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 947, [2002] 1 WLR 3343 followed (paragraph 9);

4.	although different considerations may apply in the case of claimants who are not fully able to manage their affairs or to understand the consequences of their actions, a claimant who is not subject to any such disability would normally have to establish that the withdrawal of a claim was induced by some factor such as threatening or overbearing behaviour, deception or similar improper conduct in order to show that notice of withdrawal of a claim was not a genuine expression of the claimant’s intention at the time when the notice was given and there was no evidence of any such conduct in this case (paragraphs 10 to 14).

The claimant entered a care home and initially paid her own fees. Following a change in legislation the local authority started paying part of the fees with the effect that attendance allowance was no longer payable to the claimant. Before that change in circumstances the claimant’s appointee was visited by an officer of the Pensions Service who advised her that alterations to the claimant’s benefits would take place when the local authority started paying the fees, without the need for any further action from her. The appointee did not inform the Disability Benefits Unit of the change of circumstances and an overpayment of attendance allowance resulted. The Secretary of State decided that the overpayment was recoverable from both the claimant and the appointee because the appointee had failed to disclose the change of circumstances. The appointee lodged an appeal. The appeal tribunal dismissed the appeal on the ground that disclosure should have been made to the Disability Benefits Unit and not to an officer of the Pensions Service. On appeal to the Commissioner the appointee argued that the duty to disclose had been qualified orally by the officer of the Pensions Service. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	where it is decided that an overpayment is recoverable from both a claimant and an appointee and the appointee appeals, the appeal should be taken to be an appeal made on behalf of both the claimant and the appointee unless it is clear that the liability of only one of them is in issue (paragraph 4);
2.	although R(SB) 21/82 was held in B v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 929, [2005] 1 WLR 3796 (also reported as R(IS) 9/06) to have been wrongly decided, the general principle expressed in R(SB) 21/82 that there could be a failure to disclose only where disclosure was reasonably to be expected is consistent with B, provided that it is accepted that disclosure is always reasonably to be expected if there is a statutory duty to disclose under regulation 32 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, and therefore most of the cases decided in reliance on that general principle, including that of the Tribunal of Commissioners in R(IS) 5/03, remain good law (paragraphs 10 and 11);
3.	while (following R(IS) 15/87) the duty to disclose information or a change of circumstances to the office administering the benefit concerned may be modified by an oral representation by an officer of the Department to the effect that further disclosure is unnecessary, in this case there had been no such modification because the claimant presumably knew that the Pensions Service did not administer attendance allowance and, in the absence of any discussion about attendance allowance, the claimant could not reasonably have thought that information would be passed to the Disability Benefits Unit (paragraphs 13 and 14);
4.	in cases where the Secretary of State seeks to recover an overpayment on the ground that there has been a failure to disclose a material fact, it is essential for the Secretary of State to produce evidence showing why the claimant was under a duty to disclose that fact, which usually involves showing why the claimant should have realised that the fact was relevant (paragraph 17);
5.	the tribunal erred in law in proceeding on the basis that there was a duty to disclose without investigating whether it was justified, because the appointee’s case that she had acted reasonably implied a challenge to the Secretary of State’s implied claim that she had breached a duty of disclosure (paragraph 18).

The claimant was in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance. He was referred for a 13 week Intensive Activity Period employment programme under regulation 75(1)(iv) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (the Regulations). The course commenced at 9.30 am on 21 March 2005. The claimant failed to arrive on time that day, arriving at some time between 10.30 am and 11.30 am. On his arrival he was informed that he was unable to start the course due to his lateness. A decision-maker imposed a sanction of a two-week fixed period of non-payment of benefit under regulation 69(1)(a) of the Regulations, on the ground that the claimant had failed, without good cause, to attend the course. The claimant appealed. The claimant’s evidence to the appeal tribunal, which was accepted, was that he had slept through his alarm on the day of the course because his grandmother had been taken to hospital the night before and he had got home late. The tribunal dismissed his appeal on the basis that his late arrival at the course amounted to a failure to attend the course, for which he did not have good cause. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the appeal tribunal had correctly identified that “good cause” is limited to the circumstances set out in regulation 73(2)(a) to (j) of the Regulations, and concluded that none of them applied to the claimant (paragraph 8);
2.	the tribunal was correct to construe the word “attend” as meaning “attend at the time prescribed by the course provider”. While other considerations might arise if the claimant had attended only a few minutes late, in this case the course provider was fully entitled to treat lateness in excess of one hour as not meeting the requirements of the course (Hinchley v Rankin [1961] 1 WLR 421 cited) (paragraphs 9 to 11).

The local authority imposed a restriction on the claimant’s rent under the old version of regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, which applied to her case by virtue of savings provisions. By regulation 11(3)(b) the restrictions did not apply to a claimant who is incapable of work for the purposes of one or more of the provisions of the Social Security Act 1975 or Part I of the Social Security and Housing Benefit Act 1982 or Part II of the Social Security Act 1986. Those Acts had been repealed and re-enacted in the Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and the provisions of that Act relating to incapacity for work were substantially amended in 1995. The claimant appealed against the local authority’s decision that she was not incapable of work. The tribunal found her incapable of work under the test that applied before the amendments. The local authority appealed to a Commissioner. The questions for the Commissioner were (i) whether incapacity for work was to be determined under the present law on incapacity for work or by the law in force when the regulation was enacted and (ii) whether the decision on incapacity for work fell to be made by the housing benefit decision-maker or the Secretary of State.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	by virtue of both specific consequential provisions and section 17(2)(a) of the Interpretation Act 1978, the references in regulation 11(3)(b) to the 1975, 1982 and 1986 Acts had to be read as references to the consolidating Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and when that Act was amended, section 13(1) of the amending Act provided that any reference in any enactment to any provision relating to incapacity for work should be construed as a reference to the corresponding new or amended provision (paragraphs 10 to 13);

2.	the effect of those provisions was sufficient for regulation 11(3)(b) to refer as to the future to the new incapacity for work regime (paragraph 14);

3.	the claimant’s incapacity for work therefore had to be determined by reference to the new law and not by reference to the law as it was before the 1995 reforms (paragraph 15);

4.	by regulation 11 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 the claimant’s incapacity for work had to be determined by the Secretary of State (paragraphs 17 to 19);

5.	a housing benefit claimant who is dissatisfied with the Secretary of State’s determination on incapacity will be able to appeal against it as a determination embodied in the housing benefit decision or against any determination on incapacity made in the context of a social security decision, and in either case the tribunal must be constituted, if appropriate, in accordance with regulation 36(2)(a)(i) of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations (paragraph 20).

Regulation 6(1A)(b) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (the Regulations) allows a claimant one month in which to submit a properly completed claim form from the first notification of intention to make “that claim”. Regulation 6(1A)(c) provides that a first notification is deemed to occur when the claimant gives notification of intention to make a claim in accordance with regulation 4(5) of the Regulations or submits a defective claim. The Secretary of State decided that the first notification in the claimant’s case was the date the claim form was requested and that therefore the delay had exceeded one month and the date of her claim was 31 August, the date the properly completed form was received. The claimant’s appeal was dismissed by an appeal tribunal and she appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	when regulation 6(1A)(b) refers to “that claim” it can only refer to the submission of a properly competed claim form  and the correct way to apply regulation 6(1A)(b) is to start with the receipt of a properly completed claim and work backwards (paragraph 13);

2.	regulation 6(1A)(c) sets out the circumstances in which a person is treated as notifying an intention to make a claim and its wording, when read into regulation 6(1A)(b), allows the claimant a choice to rely on one month from the date of notification or from the date of defective claim (paragraphs 16 to 17);

3.	the alternative interpretation would subvert the function of regulation 6(1A)(b), which was to allow a concessionary period of one month in which the claimant could get the claim form and accompanying documentation in order ((paragraph 18);

4.	in this case, the claimant could rely on regulation 6(1A)(c)(ii) and was to be treated as  notifying an intention to make a claim when she submitted her defective claim on 2 August, so that her claim was to be treated as made on that date (paragraphs 19 to 20);

5.	a notification of intention to make a claim under regulation 4(5) is not part of the process of making a claim and may be made by another person on behalf of the claimant (paragraphs 23 to 24).

Following an operation for bowel cancer, the claimant was awarded the higher rate of the mobility component and the highest rate of the care component from October 2000 on the basis that he was suffering from a progressive disease and his life expectancy was less than six months, and on evidence of mobility problems resulting from his medical treatment. Following a further operation he returned to work in November 2001. In January 2004 a decision-maker superseded the awarding decision, disallowing both components from November 2001 on the basis that there had been a change of circumstances in that he was no longer terminally ill and that there was evidence that he had no mobility or care needs. A decision was then made that there had been a recoverable overpayment of disability living allowance between November 2001 and February 2004 because he had failed to inform the DLA Unit that his needs had changed. The claimant appealed both decisions. The tribunal confirmed the supersession of the existing award in January 2004, finding that by that time there was evidence that he was no longer terminally ill. In relation to the period between November 2001 and January 2004, it found that he had no mobility or care needs which would entitle him to any award of disability living allowance, but concluded, following CDLA/1804/1999, that that was irrelevant so long as the special rules as to terminal illness applied, and therefore there was no material fact for the claimant to disclose. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	it was clear from the wording of section 73(9)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act that a terminally ill claimant will only be entitled to an award of the mobility component if, apart from the three months qualifying period, he would be entitled to it if he were not terminally ill and CDLA/1804/1999 was wrongly decided insofar as it held that section 73(12) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act gives deemed entitlement to mobility component to a claimant who satisfies the special rules as to terminal illness (paragraph 19);

2.	the claimant was therefore under a duty to disclose as a material fact the improvement in his walking ability from November 2001 and, had he done so, his award of the mobility component would have been superseded; however, on the balance of probabilities the award of the care component would have continued under the special rules for the terminally ill (paragraphs 20 to 21);

3.	there was therefore a recoverable overpayment from November 2001, but only of the mobility component and only to the date when the DLA Unit knew that the claimant had gone back to work (paragraph 24). 

The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal to determine the amount recoverable.

Applicable amount – severe disability premium – exclusion from entitlement where claimant residing with landlord – meaning of “residing with” 
The claimant lost her appeal against the withdrawal of the severe disability premium (SDP) on the ground that she “resided with” her sister and therefore did not satisfy the conditions of entitlement to SDP in paragraph 13(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 that she had no non-dependant with whom she was normally residing. She had previously received SDP when living in a hostel. In her appeal to the Commissioner the claimant argued that she was not “residing with” her sister as that expression meant living as a couple and she and her sister occupied separate households. Further she submitted that the tribunal’s decision was in breach of various Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and in particular that the definition of “non-dependant” in regulation 3 of the 1987 Regulations was discriminatory contrary to Article 14, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol 1, in providing that the exception for persons paying rent on a commercial basis did not apply to close relatives and she would have been entitled if she had lived with a stranger rather than her sister.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	(following Chief Adjudication Officer v Bate [1996] 1 WLR 814 (also reported as R(IS) 12/96) “resides with” should be given its ordinary and natural meaning and is not limited to people living as a couple (paragraph 18);
2.	(following R (Kadhim) v Brent Housing Board [2001] QB 955) while persons occupying separate bedrooms but sharing kitchen and living room will normally be residing with each other, the tribunal had erred in assuming that, because the kitchen and living room were shared, the claimant and her sister were necessarily residing with each other and it would be necessary for further findings of fact to be made as to the living arrangements (paragraphs 19 to 21);
3.	the exclusion from entitlement to SDP of close relatives where there is a commercial arrangement is not contrary to Article 14 since it is objectively justified on the ground that it is assumed that close relatives are likely to be willing to provide some domestic assistance (paragraphs 32 to 44).
The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal and remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal.

The claimant claimed housing benefit on the basis of liability to pay rent to her sister, who lived in the same house. Her claim was refused under regulation 7(1)(b) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 because the person to whom she was liable to pay rent also resided in the dwelling and was a close relative. The claimant appealed, contending that regulation 7(1)(b) infringed various provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and in particular was discriminatory contrary to Article 14, taken together with Article 8, because its effect was to treat her less favourably, by reason of her relationship with her sister, than any other person occupying the property in return for rent would have been treated. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, finding that the regulation concerned pursued a legitimate aim in seeking to eradicate abuse of the benefit system and any differential treatment arising bore a reasonable relationship of proportionality to that aim. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	where landlord and tenant are sharing the majority of the living accommodation in the residential unit, even where the claimant has exclusive occupation of her room, it is right to regard them, for the purposes of regulation 7(1)(b), as both residing in “the dwelling” in respect of which the claimant pays rent (R (Painter) v Carmarthenshire County Council Housing Benefit Review Board [2001] EWHC Admin 308 and CH/3656/2004 followed) (paragraph 13);

2.	the reasoning in Painter (supra) and Tucker v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2001] EWCA Civ 1646, relating to regulation 7(1)(c) and (d) respectively, is equally applicable to regulation 7(1)(b), which is justified as a reasonable and proportionate anti-abuse measure, and for that reason does not involve discrimination in breach of Article 14 (paragraphs 25 to 36).

The claimant suffered from chronic alcoholism and various other conditions. Following a medical examination at which he was intoxicated, he was awarded DLA consisting of the mobility component at the higher rate and the care component at the middle rate, for two years. His renewal claim was refused following a medical examination at which he was sober. He appealed and the appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that his problems were related directly to too much alcohol rather than conditions which might well have been the result of too much alcohol. The claimant appealed and the Chief Commissioner appointed a Tribunal of Commissioners to deal with the case as raising a question of law of special difficulty. The Tribunal of Commissioners had the benefit of expert written and oral evidence in respect of the effects of alcohol consumption and the nature of alcohol dependence. 
 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	physical symptoms or manifestations flowing from alcohol dependence alone do not result from an identifiable physical cause and in the light of Harrison and CDLA/2879/2004 (now reported as R(DLA) 4/06), it followed that a claimant is not entitled to higher rate mobility component if the only disability on which his claim is based flows from only such a cause (paragraph 19);

2.	if a separate medical condition arises from the excessive consumption of alcohol, then any disabling manifestations of such a condition can be taken into account in assessing entitlement to the care component and the lower rate of the mobility component of DLA, whether or not the ingestion is related to alcohol dependence (paragraphs 21 to 22);

3.	the transient and immediate effects consequent upon a person choosing to consume too much alcohol are not to be taken into account in determining entitlement to DLA because a claimant does not require the help contemplated by the legislation if he or she can reasonably be expected to avoid the need for attention or supervision by controlling the consumption of alcohol (paragraphs 23 to 25);

4.	alcohol dependency is a medical condition, not a disability, but there is a direct causal link between dependence on alcohol and intoxication (paragraphs 28 to 30);

5.	the diagnostic criteria for dependence show that it is inappropriate to think in absolute terms of choice or uncontrollable addiction; it is more helpful to think in terms of the degree of self-control that is realistically attainable in the light of all of the circumstances, including the claimant’s history and steps that are available to him to address his dependence (paragraphs 32 and 33);

6.	a person who cannot realistically stop drinking to excess because of a medical condition and cannot function properly as a result can reasonably be said both to be suffering from disablement and to require any attention, supervision or other help contemplated by the legislation that is necessary as a consequence of his drinking and so there is no reason why the effects of being intoxicated should not be taken into account in determining his entitlement to the care component of DLA (paragraph 33);

7.	there is also no reason why the possibility of the claimant’s taking advantage of professional assistance to control his alcohol consumption should not be taken into account (paragraph 36);

8.	the tribunal in this case was wrong simply to exclude from all consideration the effects of the claimant being drunk (paragraph 43).  

The Commissioners remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for rehearing.

The claimant claimed disability living allowance based mainly on pain and fatigue resulting from chronic fatigue syndrome. His claim was refused and he appealed to a tribunal. He was present and represented at the hearing of his appeal and the tribunal had several items of medical evidence before it. The record of proceedings stated that after 50 minutes the chairman had invited the claimant’s comments on the tribunal’s observation of his apparent lack of fatigue. The tribunal dismissed the appeal. The chairman stated as one of 12 reasons for the decision the tribunal’s observation of the claimant during the hearing. In the claimant’s appeal to the Commissioner, it was argued on his behalf that the tribunal had failed to explain the significance of the observations to the claimant and to seek further clarification.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	a tribunal may fail to comply with its inquisitorial function if it neglects to make appropriate inquiries in the light of an observation made during the hearing and the failure to allow a claimant to comment on observations may be a violation of the tribunal’s duty to ensure a fair hearing (CDLA/440/1995) (paragraph 13);

2.	a tribunal must not take observations into account unless they are relevant to an issue of fact that is before it and to the time of the decision under appeal and reliable as evidence of the claimant’s overall disablement (paragraphs 14 to 16);

3.	if a tribunal does take observations into account, it must assess their proper significance in the context of the evidence as a whole and that evidence may have to include the result of further inquiries into the issues of relevance and reliability. The extent to which further inquiries are appropriate may depend upon the significance that the observation is likely to have in the final deliberations (paragraphs 17 to 18);

4.	if an observation is used purely as confirmation of a conclusion that the tribunal would have reached anyway, there is no need for a tribunal to investigate it further or for the claimant to have a chance to comment on it. However, if an observation is one of the factors taken into account in reaching a conclusion, any failure in the tribunal’s inquisitorial duty or violation of the right to a fair hearing will mean that the decision is wrong in law (De Silva v Social Security Commissioner [2001] EWCA Civ 539 followed) (paragraph 19);

5.	in the present case the observations were relevant to the tribunal’s findings, the tribunal did not attribute to them an inappropriate significance, as it was clear that they were not a decisive factor in the tribunal reaching its conclusion, and the claimant and his representative were given sufficient opportunity to respond to them (paragraphs 21 to 28).

The claimant was married with three children. She and her husband separated in April 2003 but the husband moved back into the matrimonial home in October 2003. She made a single claim for tax credits with effect from April 2003. After the end of the 2003/2004 tax year the Inland Revenue decided that the claimant and her husband had not been separated in circumstances in which the separation was likely to be permanent and they therefore fell to be treated as a married couple as defined in section 3(5) of the Tax Credits Act 2002, so that she should have made a joint claim for tax credits. The claimant appealed. The tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	before concluding that a separation is unlikely to be permanent, the tribunal must consider why the separation has occurred and what indications there are that the couple may be reconciled and must conclude that there is at least a 50 per cent chance of a reconciliation. It is unlikely that such a reconciliation will occur before the parties have taken steps to deal with the problems that led to the separation in the first place, and have actually begun the process of arranging to live together again. A tribunal should be slow to differ from the claimant’s own genuine assessment of the likelihood of a reconciliation, although that is a subjective assessment and the tribunal is not bound by it (paragraph 18);
2.	on the facts of this case the likelihood initially following the separation was that the separation would be permanent (paragraphs 19 to 23);
3.	there was no evidence that the separation had ceased to be likely to be permanent before 1 October 2003 and the claimant was entitled to make a single claim and to receive tax credits on the basis of her single claim from 6 April 2003 to 30 September 2003 (paragraph 24).

The appeals were brought on behalf of former underground coal miners who were exposed to vibration from their work tools. Each had been found to suffer from vibration white finger, a prescribed disease for the purposes of industrial injuries disablement benefit (IIDB). Each contended that in his case the percentage disablement awarded by the appeal tribunal was too low, because the tribunal’s approach to the issue of percentage disablement resulting from this condition was wrong in law. There is no prescribed degree of disablement set out in Schedule 2 to the Social Security (General Benefits) Regulations 1982, but regulation 11(8) of those Regulations requires the Secretary of State or an appeal tribunal to have such regard as may be appropriate to the prescribed degrees of disablement set out in that Schedule. A Tribunal of Commissioners was directed to consider the correct approach to assessment of disablement in such cases.
Held, formally allowing the appeal in CI/535/2005 and dismissing the appeal in CI/1814/2005, that:
1.	in an exercise of judgment and evaluation such as is involved in the assessment in percentage terms of an individual claimant’s degree of functional disablement, there is inevitably a band within which an assessment would be reasonable, and the reasons why a particular percentage has been arrived at rather than a point or two higher or lower may be impossible to state with exact precision. In the present cases the tribunals had given adequate reasons by setting out the factual basis upon which the assessment had been made; namely what disabilities were taken into account by the tribunal in concluding that a particular percentage disablement was appropriate (paragraphs 44 to 51);
2.	it was clear that the tribunal in each case had (following R(I) 3/02) correctly taken into account, and reflected in its percentage assessment, all relevant sensorineural aspects of the claimant’s vibration-induced hand condition, and not just those involved in the episodes of blanching (paragraphs 52 to 55);
3.	the advice in CI/2553/2001 to have proper regard to judicial guidelines on assessment of damages did no more than direct the tribunal to take into account certain specific criteria referred to in those guidelines, namely the length and severity of the claimant’s attacks and symptoms, the extent and/or severity and/or rapidity of deterioration of his condition, and his age and prognosis. Such matters can be taken into account on the assessment of a person’s functional disablement without any express reference to the judicial guidelines. It was clear that both tribunals had taken these matters into account (paragraphs 56 to 58);
4.	there was no objective clinical diagnostic test for PD A11, and the Stockholm scale for measurement of sensorineural symptoms did not focus on the measurement of functional disability, so that there was no inconsistency between the tribunal’s acceptance of medical reports containing evidence of those measurements and the levels of functional disablement actually found to exist when that and all the other evidence about the practical loss of functional ability suffered by each claimant was considered and taken together (paragraphs 59 to 63);
5.	the claimants’ contentions against the percentage assessments of disablement therefore failed, although the Commissioners formally allowed the appeal in CI/535/2005 to the extent of varying the tribunal decision on the statutory “date of onset” of the disease and the related start of the disablement assessment period, to accord with the requirements of the legislation as explained in R(I) 5/04 (paragraphs 64 to 66);
6.	questions of assessment of an individual’s percentage level of functional disablement are primarily matters of factual judgment entrusted by the legislation to the specialist tribunals best qualified to decide them and it would be contrary to the intent of the legislation to attempt to construct a scale, or to set recommended or suggested percentage levels of assessment of disability from prescribed disease A11 or from any other prescribed disease where the legislation itself does not do so (paragraphs 67 to 78).

The Chief Commissioner directed that the appeal be heard by a Tribunal of Commissioners because it involved questions of law of special difficulty and, in particular, the questions whether regulation 101(2) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 was defective and whether Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Chiltern District Council [2003] EWCA Civ 508 (also reported as R(H) 2/03), which was followed in R(H) 3/04, was correctly decided and, if not, whether it was binding upon Commissioners. Regulation 101 had been amended with effect from October 2001 and again from April 2006.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the decision of the Court of Appeal in Chiltern was not material to the issues before the Commissioners, since either it construed regulation 101 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 in a way that was ultra vires, in which case it was no longer relevant because the legislation had been amended, or else it failed to draw the traditional distinction between recoverability and recovery, which was inconsistent with subsequent binding authority in the form of B v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, which does recognise the traditional distinction between decisions as to recoverability (which are appealable) and decisions concerned with recovery (which are not) (paragraphs 26 to 38);

2.	R(H) 3/04 remained authority for the proposition that an appeal against the exercise of a non-justiciable discretion is limited to points of law (paragraph 39);

3.	however, properly construed, the primary legislation in force from 1 October 2001 required secondary legislation to specify whether an overpayment is recoverable from another person in addition to the person to whom it was paid or instead of the person to whom it was paid so that no non-justiciable choice falls to be made within a decision as to recoverability (paragraphs 40 to 52);

4.	regulation 101 of the 1987 Regulations as in force from 1 October 2001 and re-enacted in regulation 101 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 until 9 April 2006 must be construed so that an overpayment is recovered from those mentioned in regulation 101(2) as well as the person to whom the overpayment was made, except where regulation 101(1) applies and it is not recoverable from the latter person and regulation 101(2)(b) as in force from 10 April 2006 must be read in the same way (paragraphs 53 to 58);

5.	a single decision as to the recoverability of an overpayment should always be addressed to all those from whom it is recoverable and, if the overpayment is not recoverable from the person to whom the overpayment was made, it should include a decision to that effect and be addressed to that person. Then, if there is an appeal, every relevant person is likely to be a party (paragraphs 59 and 60);

6.	if that is not done and a tribunal finds that an overpayment is recoverable from both the appellant and a person who is not a party to the proceedings, the tribunal should simply set aside the decision under appeal and leave the local authority to make a fresh decision (paragraph 61);

7.	in the present case the overpayment was clearly recoverable from the claimant, but was also probably recoverable from the landlord, and the local authority’s decision would be set aside (paragraph 65).

Tribunal practice – evidence – admissibility of documents from matrimonial proceedings in child support appeals
Revision and supersession – whether tribunal has power to make final decision on a reference of an application for a variation
The resident parent applied for a variation of the child support maintenance assessment made against the non-resident parent on the grounds of diversion of income and lifestyle inconsistent with income. The Secretary of State referred the application to a tribunal for decision under section 28D(1) of the Child Support Act 1991. The tribunal decided that a variation should be made on grounds of diversion of income. It re-calculated the child support maintenance as £89.79 a week, and identified £60 a week as the amount it was just and equitable to direct the non-resident parent to pay. In its statement of reasons the tribunal identified an error in its calculations and re-calculated the child support maintenance as £53.92 per week, but still identified £60 a week as the amount it was just and equitable to direct the non-resident parent to pay. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner with the support of the Secretary of State. Before the Commissioner, the Secretary of State argued that the corrected decision of the tribunal that the just and equitable amount to be paid was greater than the actual amount calculated was wrong in law. He also argued that a tribunal deciding on reference an application for revision or supersession of a child support decision on variation grounds had power only to decide if there were grounds for a variation, and must refer the revision or supersession decision back to the Secretary of State. Among other arguments, the non-resident parent argued that the resident parent had produced to the tribunal documents from family court proceedings between them in breach of the Family Proceedings Rules.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while it was arguable that the “just and equitable” provisions in section 28F of the Child Support Act 1991 and regulation 21 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 gave the Secretary of State and a tribunal power to reduce the actual weekly amount of child support maintenance to be directed as a result of a variation, it was beyond question that there was no power to increase the amount of child support maintenance above the amount identified as justified by one or more grounds for variation (paragraphs 12 to 14);
2.	the difficulties about the admissibility of court documents as evidence in child support appeals expressed in CCS/4438/2001 and CCS/3749/2003 could be obviated by the simple procedure for obtaining the formal authority of the relevant court used by the resident parent in this case (paragraph 18);
3.	a tribunal cannot fully perform its function of deciding whether there should be a variation in a case where there is a maintenance calculation in force and the application is for a revision or supersession, without deciding at the same time whether there are grounds for revision or supersession (paragraphs 29 to 32);
4.	however, a tribunal can, if that is the best way forward, take decisions in principle or on the available evidence, then refer any final aspect back to the Secretary of State, provided that if there is any disagreement at that stage between the Secretary of State and the other parties the matter must be referred back to the tribunal for formal decision (paragraph 33).
The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for hearing with directions.

The claimant lost his appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State that he was not entitled to incapacity benefit because he was not incapable of work. On appeal to the Commissioner, the claimant alleged that the medically qualified panel member sitting on the tribunal had refused to look at X-rays produced by the claimant at the hearing. There was no mention, either in the record of proceedings or the statement of reasons, of the claimant asking the tribunal to look at the X-rays or of the tribunal declining to do so. The Commissioner therefore directed the panel members, under regulation 20(2) of the Social Security Commissioners (Procedure) Regulations 1999, to state whether, and if so on what ground, the medically qualified panel member had refused to look at the X-rays. The legally qualified panel member accepted that the medically qualified panel member had declined to look at the X-rays.  The medically qualified panel member was unable to remember the particular hearing but said that his understanding was that no clinical examination of the appellant should be undertaken and that looking at X-rays could be interpreted as such. In addition he had no special expertise in the interpretation of X-rays. The Secretary of State, supporting the appeal, submitted that this approach was wrong.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	studying an X-ray is not prohibited by section 20(3)(a) of the Social Security Act 1998 which prohibits physical examination “of the person” and not of the evidence in the person’s case;
2.	a tribunal is not bound to consider X-rays if it lacks the expertise to analyse them but should consider whether to adjourn in the light of the relevance of the X-rays and the likelihood of their being helpful in relation to a live issue in the case and, if asked for a statement of reasons having refused to adjourn, should explain its approach; 
3.	if the tribunal declined to look at the X-ray evidence because it believed it was prohibited from doing so, it erred in law. If it declined because the medically qualified panel member did not feel qualified to express a view on the significance of the X-rays, either it erred in law in failing to consider adjourning so that an expert’s opinion could be obtained or its decision was erroneous in point of law because the chairman failed to explain the reason for not adjourning and a good reason could not be inferred.
The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal.

The claimant was in receipt of higher rate mobility and lowest rate care component of disability living allowance (DLA) and working 20 hours a week when she was awarded working tax credit (WTC) for the 2003/04 tax year. Her DLA stopped on 1 August 2003 and the Board of Inland Revenue (the Board) revised its decision, ending entitlement to WTC from that date on the ground that she no longer fell to be treated as engaged in qualifying remunerative work by virtue of Case C(a) in regulation 9(4)(a) of the Working Tax Credit (Entitlement and Maximum Rate) Regulations 2002, which enabled her to satisfy the requirements for the disability element in regulation 9(1)(c). The claimant’s appeal to a tribunal was dismissed. On appeal to the Commissioner, she argued that the regulations required only that she be in receipt of DLA at the date of claim for WTC, whereas the Board argued that her entitlement to WTC could only be established in respect of each day on which she was entitled to DLA. The claimant further argued that under the provisions for disability working allowance, the predecessor benefit, entitlement would have continued for the whole year even if entitlement to DLA had ceased and that the same rule should apply.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	it was clear from the wording of the relevant regulations that on any day for which DLA was not payable, the claimant did not fall within Case C(a) and therefore did not satisfy regulation 9(1)(c) and could not be treated as engaged in qualifying remunerative work and therefore was not entitled to WTC (paragraph 17);
2.	disability working allowance had been replaced first by disabled person’s tax credit and then by the current system, which operates under the Tax Credits Act 2002. That Act repealed the previous provisions and created a whole new system, and in the absence of any relevant saving or transitional provisions from the old system the previous rule cannot be relied upon (paragraph 13).

The claimants in the three appeals were widowers over pension age who had been refused bereavement payments on the grounds that their late wives had been getting a Category A retirement pension on their own contributions topped up by a Category B pension based on their husbands’ contributions, (as provided for in section 53, later replaced by section 51A, of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992). Under section 36(1)(a) of the same Act it is a condition of entitlement to a bereavement payment that the claimant is under pensionable age or that the claimant’s late spouse had not been receiving a Category A retirement pension under section 44. The claimants argued that they should be treated as if their wives had been receiving only the Category B pension and were therefore entitled to the bereavement payment. In the third case a tribunal had accepted that argument and the Secretary of State had appealed. The other claimants appealed to the Commissioner arguing that, as their wives did not have a full contribution record and were not therefore entitled to a full Category A pension, their pensions did not derive from section 44 of the Act but from elsewhere and that this type of Category A pension was not excluded by section 36(1)(a). Alternatively instead of the top-up provision of the former section 53 being applied, the provisions of section 43 of the 1992 Act should have operated to allow the wives entitlement to whichever of the pensions would have been most favourable to them, that being to turn the Category A pensions back into category B pensions. Furthermore the Human Rights Act required both section 36(1)(a) and if necessary section 43(5) to be read so as to remove the anomaly between bereavement payment claimants whose spouses had or had not opted for a Category B rather than a Category A pension, which amounted to discrimination between people in relevantly similar circumstances.

Held, allowing the appeal of the Secretary of State and dismissing the appeals of the two claimants, that:

1.	the tribunal in the third case had misdirected itself. Under section 51A(2) of the 1992 Act a category A pension is topped up to the level of a Category B pension and remains a Category A pension: there is no substitution of a different category of pension (paragraph 11);

2.	although the Act contains no express definition of a Category A pension it is from section 44 that it derives (even when a reduced pension is  payable by the supplementary provisions of section 60) and the claimants therefore failed to meet the condition in section 36(1)(a) (paragraph 19);

Taken in conjunction with the rule of finality of determinations on entitlement in section 60 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and section 17 of the Social Security Act 1998 this meant that, once the entitlement of the wives had been determined and not appealed, there was no alternative entitlement under section 43 (paragraphs 23 and 24);

[2007] EWCA Civ 749)
",,"Commissioners’ jurisdiction – procedural decision made by legally qualified panel member – whether there is a right of appeal to a Commissioner 
In each case the appellant applied to the Commissioner for leave to appeal against a procedural decision made by a legally qualified panel member (LQPM): in Mr Morina’s case the decision was to refuse to admit a late appeal that was outside the absolute time limit of 13 months imposed by regulation 32(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 and in Mr Borrowdale’s case the decision was to strike out his appeal under regulation 46 for want of jurisdiction as the disputed decision was listed as unappealable in Schedule 2 to the Regulations. The Secretary of State argued that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to hear either appeal. The Commissioner accepted that he had jurisdiction but dismissed the appeals on their merits. The Commissioner refused the Secretary of State leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the Court should decide whether to grant leave to a successful party. The Secretary of State renewed the application to the Court of Appeal, contending that in making the decisions in question an LQPM was not an appeal tribunal, or alternatively that such decisions were not “decisions” appealable to a Commissioner under section 14(1) of the Social Security Act 1998. 
Held, granting permission and allowing the appeal, that:
1.	section 15 of the Social Security Act 1998 provided for an appeal to the Court of Appeal on a question of law against “any decision of a Commissioner”, rather than “any judgment or order” as in appeals from the High Court, and therefore where, as in these cases, there were in reality two decisions, one as to jurisdiction and the other as to the merits, the Court was not precluded from hearing an appeal by the successful party on the point on which he had lost, although it was to be expected that such appeals would be permitted only where a point of general significance was raised (Lake v Lake [1955] P 336 distinguished) (paragraph 10);
2.	since decisions to extend time or strike out were inherently judicial rather than administrative and since there was no provision in the 1998 Act empowering the Secretary of State to make regulations which conferred decision-making power in connection with an appeal on any body other than one acting as an appeal tribunal, in making procedural decisions to extend time or to strike out an appeal an LQPM was an appeal tribunal (paragraphs 28 to 30);
3.	(per Kay LJ) however Bland v Chief Supplementary Benefit Officer [1983] 1 WLR 262 (also reported as R(SB) 12/83) and White v Chief Adjudication Officer [1986] 2 All ER 905 (also reported as an appendix to R(S) 8/85) were authority for the proposition that some interlocutory decisions were not “decisions” for the purposes of section 14(1) of the Social Security Act 1998, because they did not determine the matter in dispute, and Rickards v Rickards [1990] Fam 194 was to be distinguished because there the judge had the power to grant the application whereas in both the present cases the appellant was seeking from the appeal tribunal something it had no jurisdiction to grant (paragraphs 32 to 40);
4.	(per Arden LJ and Sir Anthony Clarke MR) purely as a matter of statutory construction and applying the purposive approach set out in Lane v Esdaile [1891] AC 210 to analogous legislation, section 14(1) cannot apply to a decision by an LQPM that the purported appeal is an appeal that Parliament has provided cannot be made because such a construction would produce diametrically the opposite result from that which was clearly intended by the legislation (paragraphs 42 to 45 and 50).

The three claimants, who had learning difficulties, shared a house of which the landlord was Rivendell Lake Housing Association Limited (Rivendell). Rivendell held the property under a 30-year lease from Supported Living Limited (SLL). Support for the claimants was provided by Citizenship First (CF). There was a written agreement between SLL, Rivendell and CF, but Rivendell had no contractual or statutory obligation to provide support and had not engaged CF to provide it. The three claimants applied for housing benefit. The local authority restricted the eligible rent to the local reference rent, applying the version of regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 which had been in force since 2 January 1996. The claimants argued on appeal that their accommodation was exempt by virtue of the savings provision in regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1995. That regulation defines exempt accommodation as including accommodation provided by certain bodies where the landlord or a person acting on its behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. The issue for the tribunal was whether the care provider (CF) was acting on Rivendell’s behalf in providing housing related support. The tribunal found that the care, support and supervision were provided by CF for and on behalf of Sheffield City Council social services department and dismissed the appeal. It was argued for the claimants that the tribunal should have adopted a wider interpretation, in which accommodation is “exempt accommodation” where a landlord is participating in arrangements for the provision of supported accommodation and, if the care provider did not provide the care, the landlord would have to ensure it was received from another source.
Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	in the absence of any contractual or statutory obligation on the part of Rivendell to provide the care, support and supervision, and given that Rivendell did not engage or instruct CF to provide it, it could not be said that CF were “acting on [Rivendell’s] behalf”, within the meaning of that expression in regulation 10(6) of the 1995 Regulations (paragraphs 30 to 33);
2.	it was not self-evident that if CF ceased to provide the care, Rivendell would in practice have to seek to ensure that it was received from another source, since the Council appeared to have statutory obligations to provide the necessary care, but even if in practice Rivendell would wish to take steps to ensure such provision, that would not mean that the provider was acting on behalf of Rivendell (paragraphs 34 to 38);
3.	the agreement provided that CF would be responsible for “all necessary care, support and supervision” and a consequence of the wider interpretation would appear to be that not only the strictly housing-related support, but also the personal care and supervision, was being provided by CF “on [Rivendell’s] behalf”, a consequence for which the claimants did not contend (paragraph 39);
4.	there was a crucial distinction between the situation where the housing provider contracts the provision of care to a sub-contractor and an arrangement such as that in the present case, and the fact that the needs of the claimants for specialist accommodation are the same in the two situations cannot justify giving the words “acting on its behalf” a meaning which they cannot reasonably bear (paragraphs 40 to 45);
5.	Gaspet Ltd v Elliss (Inspector of Taxes) [1985] 1 WLR 1214 was support for the view that, to fall within the definition in regulation 10(6), the care must be provided either by the landlord or by a person acting in some sense for him and it is clearly not sufficient that the provision of the care benefits the landlord, even if that benefit is intended (paragraphs 46 to 52).

The claimant was granted refugee status on 12 October 2001 and notification of the decision was sent to her solicitors on 10 January 2002. The solicitors failed to forward the decision to her and asked the Home Office to issue a replacement, which they did on 17 July 2003. The claimant applied for income support on 13 August 2003, requesting backdating under regulation 21ZA(2) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 to 9 December 1997, the date she claimed asylum. This was refused on the basis that she was outside the 28-day time limit for making such a claim, which ran from the date of notification of the grant of refugee status. The claimant appealed, arguing that notification to her personally was required and that she had claimed within 28 days of becoming aware of the notification. The decision was upheld by the tribunal following CIS/3797/2003 and CIS/3832/2003, which held that notification sent to an agent was effective as such if the agent received it within the scope of his actual or apparent authority, whether or not it was transmitted to the principal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the ground that those decisions were wrongly decided because social security and immigration legislation both excluded the common law of agency. It was argued that income support legislation requires personal action, subject to express exception such as in regulation 33 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, and should therefore require notice to the claimant in person. The Commissioner upheld the tribunal’s decision on the basis that the general law of agency applied and the claimant’s solicitor was her agent. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, submitting that rather than considering general law doctrines such as agency, the relevant task was to construe the statute and the regulations. Her representative accepted that, to the extent that it had any immigration effect, the notification given to the claimant’s immigration solicitor and referred to in regulation 21ZA(1) was valid but he argued that, because regulation 21ZA(2) is concerned with income support and not with immigration, it could only be brought into operation by a notice to the refugee personally because it triggered a period during which a claim for income support could be made which could only be done by the claimant personally.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	reading paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation 21ZA together, that which is required for the purposes of paragraph (2) is identical to that which is required for paragraph (1) so that a notification which is effective for the purposes of paragraph (1) is, by that very fact, relevant and sufficient for paragraph (2) (paragraph 23);
2.	although a solicitor could not claim income support on behalf of a refugee in the sense of signing the form, being able to advise the client about the consequences of the letter, including the possibility of making a claim for income support, was enough to show that the solicitor was able not only to receive the notice but also to deal with it (paragraph 23);
3.	the appeal tribunal and the Commissioner were both right.

The claimant was renting a property and receiving income support and housing benefit. Following advice that a programme of graduated exercise would benefit his condition, he purchased a house on an interest-only mortgage of £484,000 in order to accommodate exercise equipment and was bought out of his tenancy. He was awarded interest on the loan, being treated as satisfying either or both of sub-paragraphs 4(8) and 4(9) of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 but the appropriate amount of the loan was restricted to £100,000 under paragraph 11(5). He appealed arguing that, as the purchase of the house was necessary because of his disablement, he was not subject to the restriction. The tribunal dismissed the appeal but gave leave to appeal to a Commissioner. The claimant argued before the Commissioner that paragraph 4(7) of Schedule 3 conferred on him the right to have all his interest taken into account in calculating his applicable amount and that paragraph 4(12) overrode the effect of paragraph 11(5). In the alternative, he was entitled to have his housing costs met up to the level of his previous housing benefit.

He further argued that regulation 16(3) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (the Regulations) applied to him so that he was to be treated as capable of work only on the days when he actually worked.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was wrong in its application of Chief Adjudication Officer v Astle as that case concerned a claim for benefit for a period of work which was sandwiched between two linked periods when the claimant was not capable of work. In this case the claimant was claiming in respect of the days when he did not work (paragraph 6);
2.	as the claimant’s earnings exceeded the earnings limit in regulation 17(2), under regulation 16(1) of the Regulations he fell to be treated as capable of work on each day in any week in which he worked even though, but for the work, he would have been treated as incapable (paragraphs 7 and 8);
3.	regulation 16(3) only applies in the first or last weeks of any period of incapacity for work. In his case, each period of incapacity was within eight weeks of the previous period, even ignoring the weeks when he worked, and the periods were therefore linked by section 30C(1)(c) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The intermediate weeks were in no case the first or last weeks of a period of incapacity and regulation 16(1) therefore applied (paragraphs 10 to 13).

The claimant had been in receipt of attendance allowance since 1985. She had resided in a nursing home which was privately owned and run since 2 November 2000. The claimant had been in receipt of free personal care and nursing care allowance from her local authority, Highland Council, from 1 July 2002. Notification of the free personal care allowance was made to the Department for Work and Pensions on 11 August 2003. The decision-maker decided that the claimant was entitled to attendance allowance but that benefit was not payable to her from 22 July 2002 and that there had been an overpayment of benefit which was recoverable from her. The tribunal upheld that decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	CSA/164/2004 (now reported as R(A)1/07) had been correctly decided. If the interpretation of “accommodation” and “cost of accommodation” did not having the meaning set out in that decision, regulation 7(5) of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 would be deprived of meaning or content (paragraph 11);
2.	the “cost of accommodation” was the aggregate cost of the bricks and mortar of the building and the ancillary services provided, including personal care (paragraph 12); 
3.	the distinction between the payability of attendance allowance being affected by a care allowance in the case of a person who resides in a private nursing home but not being affected in the case of a person who resided in his or her own home was a policy matter within the discretion of the Scottish Executive. To whom attendance allowance was payable, in the light of the introduction of the personal care allowance, was a matter for the UK Government (paragraph 13).

The claimant, who was a child, was found by a neuro-psychologist to have significant behavioural and learning difficulties with prominent language processing disorder and associated behavioural problems. The head teacher of her school said that she had difficulty socialising and that there was a classroom assistant to motivate the claimant’s learning and keep her on track. An appeal tribunal refused the claimant’s appeal. Following a successful appeal to a Commissioner, a fresh tribunal again refused the appeal on the interpretation of the term “bodily function”. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The appeal raised questions of special legal difficulty as to whether prompting and motivation were capable of constituting attention in connection with an impaired bodily function. The matter was considered by a tribunal of Commissioners.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the functions of the brain were included within the term “bodily functions”. This was consistent with the approach of the courts in such cases as R v National Insurance Commissioner ex parte Secretary of State for Social Services [1981] 1 WLR 1017 (also reported as an Appendix to R(A) 2/80) (“Packer’s Case”), Mallinson v Secretary of State for Social Services [1994] 1 WLR 630 (also reported as R(A) 3/94), Cockburn v Chief Adjudication Officer [1997] 1 WLR 799 (also reported as an Appendix to R(A) 2/98) and Woodling v Secretary of State for Social Services [1984] 1 WLR 348 (paragraphs 13 to 17);
2.	on the basis of the approach adopted in Mallinson and Cockburn, and as conceded by the Secretary of State, prompting and motivating were capable of constituting attention in connection with an impaired bodily function (paragraphs 18 to 27);
3.	it was necessary to consider whether a particular activity was a “bodily function”. Certain kinds of function were merely things that a body could do if the relevant bodily functions were working normally. The focus in the statutory provisions was on disablement (ie functional deficiency) and whether attention was reasonably required because of that deficiency. Even where a particular activity could not be described as a bodily function, recourse must be had to the discrete bodily functions involved in the activity which will have to be identified and “unbundled”, considered and assessed. In functionally complex activities, the “unbundling” exercise was the correct approach (paragraphs 28 to 40).
The Tribunal of Commissioners set aside the decision of the appeal tribunal and referred the matter to a freshly constituted tribunal for a rehearing under the directions given in the decision.

In June and October 2000 the local authority made two decisions which the claimant challenged unsuccessfully, first at internal review and subsequently at the local authority’s housing benefit review board. He then sought a judicial review of the review decisions and reached a written agreement with the local authority. The effect of the order would have been to give jurisdiction to the appeal tribunal when it acquired housing benefit appeals from 2 July 2001. Before the agreement reached the Administrative Court, one judge had refused permission on the papers. The agreement was put before another judge, who quashed the decisions. The legal department of the local authority decided that the order was not valid and instructed the appeals officer to ignore it. Accordingly, she refused to refer the cases to the tribunal. However the Appeals Service became aware of the cases and a district chairman gave directions for them to be listed. The local authority applied for an adjournment. The tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction and refused to adjourn. It allowed the appeals. On appeal to the Commissioner, the local authority argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear cases that had not been referred to it by the local authority and, in any case, it should have disregarded the order quashing the decisions.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had no power to disregard the order of the court and had to accept it as valid (Hadkinson v Hadkinson [1952] P 285 and Isaacs v Robertson [1985] AC 97 followed) and there was no scope for a collateral challenge to the order in the tribunal proceedings, since the local authority had had a fair opportunity to challenge the order as soon as it was made (Boddington v British Transport Police [1999] 2 AC 143 followed) (paragraphs 16 and 17);
2.	an order remains valid until set aside in spite of lack of jurisdiction (Re Gale (Deceased) [1966] Ch 236 and Re B (Court’s jurisdiction) [2004] 2 FLR 741) and it was clear that the court was entitled to enter on the consideration of the matter, so that, even if the principles set out in R(I) 17/94 applied to High Court orders as well as to tribunals, any procedural irregularities did not affect the validity of the order (paragraphs 18 to 20);
3.	even if the Administrative Court might have accepted jurisdiction to review the refusal of the local authority to refer the case to the tribunal, that would not have deprived the tribunal of the power to determine whether it had jurisdiction (R v Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington Rent Tribunal, ex parte Zerek [1951] 2 KB 1 followed) (paragraphs 25 and 26 );
4.	the tribunal’s jurisdiction was not dependent on the local authority referring the case, as it is the legally qualified member who must decide whether an appeal is valid under regulation 20(1) of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 and the local authority’s role was essentially administrative (paragraphs 27 to 34).

The claimants in the two appeals were leaseholders of sheltered accommodation owned and managed by the same housing association. Both were receiving state pension credit calculated to include housing costs. In the financial year 2003/04 the housing costs included service charges attributable to the scheme manager (other than those met by the Supporting People programme funded by the local authority) and all the general administration or management charges. In the financial year 2004/05 the Department disallowed the balance of the charges attributable to the scheme manager and a proportion of the general administration or management charges. By paragraph 13(2) of Schedule II to the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 ineligible service charges include those not connected with the provision of adequate accommodation. The claimants appealed. The issue for the tribunal was what proportion of the disputed costs was attributable to the provision of accommodation. The housing association asserted to the tribunal that an average of 29 per cent of time was spent on support services and that the remaining 71 per cent was spent on work relating to provision of accommodation. The tribunals found that 71 per cent of the service charges attributable to the scheme manager and the entirety of the general administration or management charges were eligible service charges. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that the claimants had not adduced sufficient or adequate evidence to establish the eligibility of the service charges in dispute as housing costs. It was not in dispute before the Commissioner that both tribunals had erred in law in their treatment of the general administration or management charges (following CPC/968/2005) and the only issue before the Commissioner was the apportionment of the charges attributable to the scheme manager.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the evidence produced to the tribunal was principally directed towards the proposition that 29 per cent of the scheme manager’s time was spent on general counselling and support within the Supporting People programme, but it did not follow that the remainder of those costs were concerned with the provision of adequate accommodation without detail of time spent on other activities (paragraphs 18 and 19);

2.	the burden of proving that service charges are eligible as housing costs fell on the claimant (R v Stoke on Trent City Council ex parte Highgate Projects [1997] 29 HLR 271 followed) and there was nothing in Kerr v The Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL 23, [2004] 1 WLR 1372 (also reported as R 1/04(SF)) to relieve the claimant of that burden (R(IS) 2/07 followed) (paragraph 20);

3.	there was therefore no adequate or sufficient evidence to enable the tribunals to come to the conclusions they reached (paragraph 21);

4.	the eligibility or ineligibility of service charges as housing costs had to be considered in relation to each service charge unit by reference to which the landlord calculates the service charge for each resident and an average figure would not suffice (paragraph 22);

5.	while the process described by the Commissioner in paragraph 28 of R(IS) 2/07 might be described as the gold standard for assessing what proportion of charges is eligible or ineligible in such cases, such detailed evidence was not always necessary and in some cases a broader approach might suffice (CPC/968/2005  followed) (paragraph 23).

The Commissioner remitted the cases for rehearing by a differently constituted tribunal.

The claimants entered the country in November 1998 and March 1999. Both had passed through the port of entry hidden by agents and had claimed asylum on the day they arrived, one at the Home Office Immigration Department and the other at a police station. They subsequently made income support claims, which were both refused under regulation 70(3A) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (as inserted by regulation 8 of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996) because they had not claimed asylum “on [their] arrival” in the UK. Successive appeals were rejected by an appeal tribunal, by a Commissioner and by the Court of Appeal. On the claimants’ further appeal, the Secretary of State, having regard to the provisions of section 11(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, contended that the phrase “on his arrival” implicitly required that the asylum claim be made to an immigration officer at the port of entry. The claimants submitted that the phrase was imprecise and admitted of some flexibility and that they had claimed asylum at the earliest opportunity.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 70(3A) does not, despite the recommendation of the Social Security Advisory Committee, provide a comprehensive definition of the meaning of “on his arrival”. Section 11 of the Immigration Act 1971 does not resolve the ambiguity, as it is concerned with “entry”, not “arrival” (paragraphs 34 to 37);
2.	the claimants could not reasonably have been expected to claim asylum any earlier than they did, having regard both to their practical opportunity for doing so and their state of mind, including any effect of what the agents who arranged their entry may have said (R(Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 364 preferred to Shire v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ 1465). Regulation 70(3A) was therefore satisfied (paragraphs 38 to 40).

The claimant suffered from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. After a period in hospital, she became resident in a nursing home. The decision-maker decided that there had been a change of circumstances in that the claimant was in publicly funded accommodation and attendance allowance was no longer payable to her. The tribunal upheld that decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it was necessary in this case to consider legislation of the Scottish Parliament in arriving at a proper interpretation of legislative provisions of the UK Parliament (paragraph 10);
2.	in terms of section 1 of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 (the 2002 Act), a local authority is barred from charging for certain types of social care, including personal care, and no charge can be made for nursing care. The phrase “social care” did not include a service which consists in the provision of accommodation (paragraph 21);
3.	a local authority in Scotland retained a general power to charge for accommodation provided under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, but the effect of section 1 of the 2002 Act was that the local authority was precluded from charging for the first £145 of personal care and the first £65 of nursing care. The word “accommodation” could include personal and nursing care but the first £145 and £65 of those types of care was specifically excluded (paragraph 21);
4.	regulation 7 of the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 (the 1991 Regulations) had to be addressed principally with reference to legislation of the UK Parliament and in the context of a United Kingdom jurisdiction. Regulation 7 precluded the payment of attendance allowance in certain circumstances including the cost of accommodation where it was borne only or partly out public or local funds but references to the cost of accommodation did not include the cost of, inter alia, nursing care provided by a local authority for which the local authority was not to charge by virtue of section 1 of the 2002 Act (paragraph 22);
5.	“accommodation” and “cost of accommodation” should be given a wide interpretation (Steane v The Chief Adjudication Officer [1996] 1 WLR 1195 and R v North and East Devon Health Authority ex parte Coughlan) [2001] QB 213 (paragraph 22);
6.	under the rules of statutory interpretation, the specific exclusion of nursing care from the definition of “cost of accommodation” in regulation 7(5)(g) of the 1991 Regulations meant that personal care was included within the definition and that the regulation must be interpreted as such (paragraphs 22 and 23).

Supersession – effective date of superseding decision where Secretary of State knows of termination of prescribed benefit but not of the reason for the termination

The non-resident parent (NRP) had a nil assessment for child support maintenance because he was in receipt of a prescribed benefit. In February 2002 the Child Support Agency (CSA) was notified by the Benefits Agency that the entitlement to the prescribed benefit had ceased, and sent a form CSA 5 to the NRP with a covering letter stating that it was looking at the case again and wanted further information. The NRP did not reply and the CSA sent him a form CSA 59 warning him that an interim assessment might be made. However, the CSA took no further action until April 2005, when it obtained the information necessary to make a superseding decision, backdated to February 2002, resulting in substantial arrears. On his appeal to the tribunal it was contended on behalf of the NRP that the Secretary of State had not established that there had been a valid supersession decision or, if there had been, that the effective date was incorrect.  On appeal to the Commissioner, it was accepted by the Secretary of State that the tribunal had erred in failing to deal with that argument. Regulation 24 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992 provides that where the Secretary of State proposes on his own initiative to make a superseding decision he must give notice to the parties affected. Regulation 23(2) of those Regulations provides that where a superseding decision is made on the basis of evidence or information which was also the basis of a decision under section 9 or 10 of the Social Security Act 1988 the effective date of the superseding decision is the date when that evidence or information was first brought to the attention of the Secretary of State. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the word “proposes” generally indicates a state of mind somewhere on the spectrum between mere contemplation as a possibility and settled intention and must be intended to cover at least the situation where the Secretary of State suspects that a revising or superseding decision should be made but does not have the information necessary to make one. In the circumstances of the case it was very probable that a nil assessment was no longer appropriate, and the covering letter sent with the CSA 5 gave notice that the Secretary of State suspected that a superseding decision was appropriate and so satisfied regulation 24 (paragraphs 27 to 31);

2.	however, regulation 24 also required notification to the parent with care and, as there was no such notification, regulation 24 had not been complied with (paragraph 33);

3.	although the terms of regulation 24 are mandatory, Parliament could not be taken to have intended that a failure to comply with regulation 24 should render the superseding decision ineffective. It may be that regulation 24 should more properly be regarded not as a free-standing requirement but merely as part of the machinery for determining the effective date in those cases where the effective date is determined by reference to the notice given under regulation 24 (paragraphs 34 to 47);

4.	in this case, where the effective date was to be determined by the provisions of regulation 23(2), knowledge by the Secretary of State of the mere fact that a section 10 decision terminating the NRP’s award of a prescribed benefit had been made did not amount to knowledge of the evidence or information on the basis of which the section 10 decision had been made, and the superseding decision therefore took effect only from April 2005, when the Secretary of State in effect discovered the basis on which the section 10 decision had been made (paragraphs 48 to 53).

The claimant, who suffered from anxiety and depression, had been living in a property as part of a planned resettlement plan after being homeless. A new property had been found for him by the Salvation Army. However, the property had recently been vacated and required carpeting, wallpapering and redecoration. He applied for housing benefit with effect from the commencement of the tenancy but delayed moving into the property for several weeks to allow the necessary work to be carried out. In the meantime, the claimant continued to occupy his existing property and to receive housing benefit in respect of that property. The local authority determined that the claimant was not entitled to housing benefit for the new property prior to the date on which he moved in. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal which upheld his appeal. The local authority appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulations 5(5)(e) and 5(6)(c)(i) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 permitted a tenant to be treated as occupying two dwellings if, inter alia, the delay in moving into the new dwelling was reasonable and necessary in order to adapt that dwelling to meet the disablement needs of that person (paragraph 5);	
2.	the issue in this case was whether carpeting, wallpapering and painting constituted “adaptation” of the property for the purposes of regulation 5(6)(c)(i). Following CH/1363/2006, “adapting” a building should be interpreted as meaning altering the fabric or structure of the building in order to meet a disablement need (including such matters as the provision of fixed handrails, raised lavatories or widened doors). Redecoration and carpeting did not constitute “adaptations” for the purpose of regulation 5(6)(c)(i) (paragraphs 6 to 11).
The Commissioner substituted his own decision that the claimant was not entitled to housing benefit until the date when he moved into the new property.

The claimant claimed that his assessment for war disablement pension should take account of new conditions rotator cuff syndrome and degeneration of his hip joints, which he submitted were consequential on conditions which had been accepted by a previous tribunal as attributable to service. The Secretary of State issued decisions that the conditions rotator cuff syndrome left shoulder and soft tissue injury low back (post-service) were not attributable to or aggravated by service and refused to increase the existing assessment of disablement on review. On appeal the tribunal found that the claimant’s “post service back injuries, if any, were not due to service factors” and did not mention his hips. The Secretary of State issued a subsequent decision in relation to hip problems, diagnosed as right trochanteric bursitis, which was the subject of a further appeal, pending at the time of the Commissioner’s decision. In his appeal to the Commissioner, the claimant argued that the tribunal had erred in failing to explain why it did not deal with the claim in relation to hip problems. The appeal also raised issues as to whether an appeal against a decision on attributability of a condition consequential on an accepted decision was an entitlement decision (against which an appeal lies to a Pensions Appeal Commissioner) or an assessment decision (against which there is no appeal). The Commissioner also set out the status in appeals to the Pensions Appeal Commissioners of decisions of the nominated judges of the High Court and the Court of Session in appeals under the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943 from decisions of Pensions Appeal Tribunals given before 6 April 2005.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	Pensions Appeal Commissioners have taken over the statutory appeal that previously lay to the nominated judges of the High Court and, while decisions of the nominated judges remain binding on pensions appeal tribunals, as are decisions of the Commissioners, decisions of the nominated judges are not binding on the Commissioners, but will normally be followed in the absence of strong reason to the contrary (paragraphs 18 to 21);
2.	a claimant must prove injury and resulting disablement and the causal connection between them on the balance of probabilities before the question of the relationship of the injury to service is decided on the basis of giving the claimant the benefit of any reasonable doubt (Royston v Minister of Pensions [1948] 1 All ER 778, 3 War Pension Appeal Reports 1593 and Secretary of State for Defence v Rusling [2003] EWHC 1359 (QB), 13 June 2003  followed) (paragraphs 22 to 32);
3.	the tribunal had erred in law by failing to explain why the appeal failed in relation to the condition soft tissue injury low back (post-service) (paragraphs 33 to 35);
4.	while it was not necessary to decide the issue, the Commissioner inclined to the view that the tribunal had erred in failing to deal with the claimant’s submission about hip problems, since those problems were included in his claim and Rusling was authority for the view that a claimant retained the right to continue to challenge on appeal a diagnostic label for a condition under which a claim was originally rejected, even though the Secretary of State had later accepted another condition as attributable to service and as a cause of all the symptoms complained of. It would also be consistent with the essential nature of an appeal as a rehearing of the issue before the person who made the decision under appeal (Barratt v Minister of Pensions (1948) 1 WPAR 1225 and R(IB) 2/04 cited) (paragraphs 36 to 39);
5.	a contention that a claimant has a new disablement operates as a claim, as distinct from a contention that disablement already accepted has got worse, which operates as an application for review of the past award. It does not matter in principle that a new disablement is said to result from an injurious process that has already been accepted as connected to service, and where the existing disablement either as expressly identified or as assumed to result from a defined injury is in the impairment of a particular organ or part of the body or mind, a contention that some different organ or part of the body or mind is now impaired is a claim in respect of a new disablement (paragraphs 40 to 47).	
The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for rehearing at the same time as the appeal against the Secretary of State’s decision in respect of the condition right trochanteric bursitis.

The claimant had lived with an ex-Royal Navy officer for 17 years, as husband and wife but not married, starting while he was serving. In 2004 he died from mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos during service and she claimed a pension under the 1983 Service Pensions Order. She did not qualify as an unmarried dependant who had lived as a spouse because of the condition that the relationship had to have begun at least six months before the member’s service began and that the dependant had charge of a child of the service member. She appealed to a tribunal, arguing that the War Pensions Scheme discriminated in favour of married partners as against unmarried partners and/or in favour of unmarried partners who satisfied the criteria in the scheme as against other unmarried partners, contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights coupled with Article 1 of the First Protocol. The tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner upheld the decision of the tribunal, following CG/1259/2002 and R(G) 1/04 in holding that words like “widow” and “widower” have a plain meaning that cannot possibly be read otherwise than as restricted to the survivors of a legally recognised marriage. The Commissioner also held that there had not been a shift in the social and legal context or some development in case law that could be capable of constituting a good reason for not following Shackell v United Kingdom, 27 April 2000 (application no 45851/99), where it was held that the situation of an unmarried partner was not analogous with that of a widow for the purposes of Article 14, and that, even if the definition of “unmarried dependant who lived as a spouse” did involve discrimination between comparable groups and were therefore caught by Article 14, there was objective and reasonable justification for the discrimination. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal.  
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the decision whether a married and unmarried couple are in an analogous situation must be made in the light of the scheme under examination and since, by the end of 2003, unmarried couples were being treated substantially the same as married couples for the purposes of the Occupational Pension Scheme and the Government had announced that it would by 2005 be treating them the same for the purposes of the 2005 Order, by 2004 it would be wrong to say that married and unmarried couples were not, in the context of armed forces benefits, in an analogous position for the purposes of Article 14 (paragraph 72);
2.	historically there was objective and reasonable justification for the distinction in the War Pensions Scheme between married and unmarried partners and between unmarried partners who fell within the very narrow criteria for a pension and other unmarried partners (paragraph 89);
3.	the point at which discrimination that was historically justifiable becomes no longer justifiable is a matter for legislative judgment and the case fell within the well-established principle that, where alleged discrimination in the field of pensions is based on non-suspect grounds, courts will be very reluctant to find that the discrimination is not justified (R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and another [2005] UKHL 37, [2006] 1 AC 173 followed) (paragraphs 52 and 89).

The claimants had their awards superseded after scoring insufficient points to satisfy the personal capability assessment.  The claimant in CSIB/803/2005 appealed to a tribunal, contending that she was entitled to 15 points under descriptor 14(b) because she had “an involuntary episode of lost or altered consciousness at least once a week” due to severe headaches.  She relied on R(IB) 3/04, submitting that the amendment made in 1996 to paragraph 14 of the Schedule to the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995, whereby the terms of  Activity 14 (“[r]emaining conscious”) had been qualified by the phrase “without having epileptic or similar seizures during waking moments”, had been invalid. The claimant in CSIB/818/2005 submitted to the tribunal that he suffered from serious headaches, loss of concentration and mild dizziness. According to his medical report, his prescribed medication tended to make him sleepy, particularly in the mornings. His representative placed some reliance on Activity 14 although it was not at the forefront of his case and was not mentioned in the tribunal’s statement of reasons.  Both appeals were dismissed.  On the claimants’ further appeals, a Tribunal of Commissioners was appointed to consider whether R(IB) 3/04 had correctly decided that, in the light of Howker v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 1632 (reported as R(IB) 3/03), the amendment to Activity 14 was invalid because, in a memorandum placed before the Social Security Advisory Committee by the Secretary of State its effect had been described as “neutral” when it was adverse to claimants.

Held, dismissing both appeals, that:

1.	applying Howker, the relevant test of invalidity was not merely whether the label “neutral” was accurate but was whether the overall effect of all the material placed before the Committee was misleading and whether there was a real possibility that a different result would have happened had that irregularity not occurred (paragraphs 35 and 36);

2.	the validity of the amendment could not be determined without consideration of its meaning and effect because a provision should, if possible, be construed so that it is valid and the material placed before the Committee was a legitimate aid to the construction of the amendment (paragraphs 38 and 39);

3.	a person had an “episode of … altered consciousness” when he or she was no longer properly aware of his surroundings or his condition, so as to be incapable of any deliberate act (paragraphs 11 and 47);

4.	“seizures” were involuntary, overwhelming and sudden and the phrase “similar seizures” was to be construed by reference to the similarity of the effects of the seizures to the effects of epileptic seizures, including the degree of suddenness of the loss or alteration of consciousness, but without consideration of whether the seizures were characterised by the discharge of cerebral neurones (paragraphs 11, 41, 42 and 56);

5.	the legislation being construed in that way, the material placed before the Committee was not misleading and the amendment was valid (R(IB) 3/04 disapproved) (paragraphs 10, 52 and 58);

6.	a Commissioner who has held a tribunal to have erred in law need refer the case to another tribunal only if he or she is not able properly to deal with any outstanding factual issues and, had the amendment been found to be invalid, the remaining issue in CSIB/818/2005 would have been largely a question of law which the Commissioners would have resolved themselves (paragraphs 66 to 69).

The claimant claimed housing benefit (HB) for weekly rent due under a tenancy agreement which provided that the property was let for a term of 25 years. The local authority awarded HB, but then withdrew it on the ground that payments under the tenancy were not eligible by virtue of regulation 10(2)(a) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 as it was a long tenancy, defined by regulation 2 of the 1987 Regulations, as “a tenancy granted for a term of years certain exceeding twenty one years …”. The claimant appealed and a tribunal allowed her appeal, holding that the reference in regulation 10(2)(a) to “a term of years certain” was a reference to a legal estate of a term of years absolute within the meaning of section 205 of the Law of Property Act 1925, and that, not being a deed, the tenancy agreement could not create a term of 25 years. The local authority appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that a specifically enforceable agreement to create a legal interest creates an equivalent equitable interest. The Secretary of State supported the view of the tribunal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	equitable interests are dependent on a court with equitable jurisdiction being prepared to grant an order of specific performance, which is discretionary, and while local authority decision-makers, appeal tribunals and Commissioners have power to take cognisance of principles of equity as well as those of the common law, they do not have power to make orders of specific performance between claimants and their landlords and cannot form conclusions as to whether an agreement not made by deed is specifically enforceable (Foster v Reeves [1892] 2 QB 255 cited) (paragraphs 17 to 20);

2.	the provisions on long tenancies in regulation 10(2)(a) read with regulation 2 are designed to set a dividing line between claimants who are not in economic terms the owners of the property they occupy and those who are, and the (income support) regime applied to owners is not intended to be applied to claimants unless they actually hold a long term interest of a sort which typically has a capital value; that will not be the case in respect of a tenancy agreement which is not made by deed unless the agreement is specifically enforceable (paragraph 22);

3.	the tribunal was therefore right to hold that the reference in regulation 10(2)(a) to a “tenancy granted” is to a tenancy granted at common law, and does not include an agreement to grant such a tenancy, even if enforceable in equity (paragraph 16);

4.	the effect of sections 4 and 7 of the Land Registration Act 2002 is that leases for more than seven years that are not registered will, at most, take effect in equity only, and will therefore not amount to a “tenancy granted” within the meaning of the 1987 Regulations (paragraph 25); 

5.	however, in all such cases there may well be a periodic tenancy in existence at common law, and the tenant will be liable for rent so long as neither party has given notice to terminate the periodic tenancy (paragraph 26).

A maintenance assessment had been made against the non-resident parent under the provisions of the Child Support Act 1991 (the 1991 Act). The non-resident parent had become aware that, on the basis of certain reforms to the Child Support Scheme introduced by the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (the 2000 Act), it would be financially advantageous to him to be assessed under the 2000 Act rather than the 1991 Act. The non-resident parent applied to the Secretary of State to be transferred to the new scheme. In effect, he sought a supersession of his maintenance assessment. The Secretary of State refused to do so. The tribunal upheld that decision. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Child Support (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2000 made provision for the supersession of assessments made under the 1991 Act to be made under the 2000 Act. However, only certain limited provisions of the 2000 Act had been brought into force by means of Commencement Orders and section 1 of the 2000 Act had only been commenced with regard to those cases specified in article 3 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (Commencement No 12) Order 2003 and had not been commenced “for all purposes”. The non-resident parent’s circumstances did not fall within any of those cases (paragraph 6);
2.	it would not be open to a decision-maker to make a conversion calculation under regulation 3(3)(a) of the Transitional Regulations since the relevant provisions for doing so had not yet been commenced (paragraph 6); 
3.	in a submission to the Commissioner, the Secretary of State indicated that it had been intended to reassess all maintenance assessments under the new scheme but, following a recommendation in a report to the Secretary of State by Sir David Henshaw, consideration was being given to discontinuing both schemes and adopting an entirely new scheme. In the meantime, no transfers were being made from the old scheme to the new scheme. It was evident from the fact that it was open to the Secretary of State to give himself the power by supersession to convert the maintenance assessment under the 1991 Act to a maintenance calculation under the 2000 Act but he had not done so, that it was the Secretary of State’s failure or refusal to give effect to the statutory power conferred on him that prevented the non-resident parent from obtaining the supersession (paragraph 7);
4.	the non-resident parent claimed that the manner of the Secretary of State’s refusal constituted a breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the legislative provisions of the old scheme and the new scheme did not, when they stand alone, give rise to any discrimination or breach of a substantive right. Even if the refusal constituted such a breach as was asserted, it was not open to the tribunal or the Commissioner to intervene in what was effectively a policy decision by the Secretary of State (paragraph 10).

The claimant was registered male at birth, but underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2001. In 2002 she claimed a retirement pension to be paid as from 28 February 2002, the date on which she turned 60, the pensionable age for a woman born before 6 April 1950.  That claim was refused on the ground that it was made more than four months before the claimant reached age 65, which is the pensionable age for men. Her appeal to the tribunal was dismissed and she appealed to the Social Security Commissioner, claiming that, following the ruling in Case C-117/01 KB [2004] ECR I-541, the refusal to pay her a retirement pension as from the age of 60 was a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as discrimination contrary to Article 4 of Directive 79/7 EEC (equal treatment). The Commissioner referred to the European Court of Justice the questions (1) whether Directive 79/7 prohibits the refusal of a retirement pension to a male-to-female transsexual until she reaches the age of 65 and who would have been entitled to such a pension at the age of 60 had she been held to be a woman as a matter of national law and (2) if so, from what date should the Court’s ruling on Question 1 have effect.
Held, that:
1.	in view of its purpose to ensure equal treatment and the fundamental nature of the rights which it seeks to safeguard, the scope of Directive 79/7 is not confined simply to discrimination based on the fact that a person is of one or other sex but is also such as to apply to discrimination arising from the gender reassignment of the person concerned (paragraphs 22 to 24);
2.	as held in KB, national legislation which precludes a transsexual, in the absence of recognition of his new gender, from fulfilling a requirement which must be met in order to be entitled to a right protected by Community law must be regarded as being, in principle, incompatible with the requirements of Community law (paragraph 31);
3.	discrimination contrary to Article 4(1) of Directive 79/7 falls within the scope of the derogation provided for by Article 7(1)(a) of that directive only if it is necessary in order to achieve the objectives which the directive is intended to pursue by allowing Member States to retain a different pensionable age for men and for women while adapting their pension systems in this respect (paragraphs 34 to 36);	
4.	consequently, that derogation must be interpreted as relating only to the determination of different pensionable ages for men and for women, and Article 4(1) of Directive 79/7 must be interpreted strictly as precluding legislation which denies a person who has undergone male-to-female gender reassignment entitlement to a retirement pension on the ground that she has not reached the age of 65, when she would have been entitled to such a pension at the age of 60 had she been held to be a woman as a matter of national law (paragraphs 37 and 38);
5.	the entry into force of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 on 4 April 2005 was liable to lead to the disappearance of disputes such as that which gave rise to the case in the main proceedings and there was therefore no need to limit the temporal effect of the judgment (paragraphs 43 to 44).	
In the light of the answer given by the European Court of Justice, the Commissioner allowed the appeal.

The claimant was discharged from service on medical grounds in 1955 on the basis that he was suffering from psychopathic personality types I and II. In 1993 he claimed war disablement pension and, following examination by a medical board, his disabilities were assessed at 30 per cent on the basis that, in addition to the aggravation of his personality disorder, he was found to have intermittent explosive disorder which was attributable to his time in service. On 15 October 2001 he wrote to the War Pensions Agency questioning why his hearing had not been taken into account in the assessment. That letter was treated as a claim for hearing loss, and in October 2003 the tribunal assessed him as having a 50 per cent non-noise induced sensorineural hearing loss, attributable to service, giving him a total assessment of 100 per cent, from 22 October 2001. The appellant appealed the subsequent award on the ground that both his pensions should be backdated to his discharge from service in 1955. In May 2005 a tribunal dismissed his appeal in connection with his hearing loss, and he appealed to the Commissioner. The claimant submitted that he fell within article 3B(2) of the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 in respect of his hearing loss. That article provides that a claim is not required for a disablement pension where a person is discharged from the armed services on medical grounds (3B(2)(a)) and his medical and service records have been delivered to the Secretary of State (3B(2)(b)). The tribunal rejected that argument, holding that the “deemed claim” provisions of article 3B(2) are an exception to the requirement to make a claim and it was implicit in article 3B(2) that its provisions were applied solely in relation to the medical condition (and medical conditions relating to it) for which the former Member of the Armed Forces was discharged. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	although the tribunal may have erred in law in not making findings as to whether a decision had been made on a “notional claim” in 1955 (on which, in accordance with practice at the time, a formal decision would not have been issued) there had not been any suggestion that no decision was made and a finding to the contrary would not have affected the outcome (paragraphs 19, 20 and 28);
2.	the “deemed claim” provisions of article 3B(2) are an exception to the requirement to make a claim and (2)(a) and (b) are clearly linked and consistent with other provisions of the Order, which require medical and service records to be provided to assist a medical practitioner on examination in identifying all disablements  linked to service (paragraphs 20 to 22);
3.	once a “notional claim” arising under article 3B is disposed of by a decision at the time, it is necessary to make a further claim in respect of any condition for which entitlement becomes an issue (paragraph 23);
4.	there was no indication that Parliament intended the legislation in the 1996 Order to give service people by virtue of a medical discharge on   a particular basis  the benefit of being “passported” under article 3B in respect of any further disability which might subsequently manifest itself, without the need to make a separate claim (paragraph 24).

",,"Capital – deprivation – capital disposed of by person who later became claimant’s partner – whether to be treated as claimant’s notional capital 
Human rights – capital disposed of by person who later became claimant’s partner – whether counting as notional capital of disabled claimant in breach of Article 8 of the Convention
The claimant was severely disabled and in need of substantial care. In March 2005 Ms H came to live with him as his partner and carer. His awards of income support and housing benefit were terminated on the ground that his partner had deprived herself of substantial capital before coming to live with him with the intention of securing future benefits for herself and the claimant and that the capital fell to be treated as his notional capital under regulation 51 of the Income Support (General) Regulations and equivalent housing benefit legislation. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, arguing that Ms H’s purpose in disposing of the capital had not been to secure entitlement to benefit, and that the notional capital rule could not apply to deprivation by a future family member. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, finding that Ms H’s account of her reasons for disposing of her capital was not credible and that the notional capital rule did apply to deprivations made by someone who only later becomes the claimant’s partner. The claimant applied for leave to appeal to a Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was additionally argued that to apply the notional capital rule in the claimant’s circumstances was harsh and irrational or in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to respect for family life). The Commissioner refused leave to appeal, holding that the tribunal had adequately explained why it did not accept Ms H’s evidence and confirming that the notional capital rule did apply by virtue of regulation 23(1) (and equivalent housing benefit legislation), which provides for references to “claimant” to be construed as references to the claimant’s partner for the purposes of calculating income and capital. The relevant regulations were authorised by section 136 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act and their effect was in principle neither oppressive nor irrational as they fulfilled an anti-avoidance function in a proportionate way. He assumed, without deciding, that Article 8(1) did apply, but held that any interference with family life was justified in terms of Article 8(2) as necessary in the interests of the economic well-being of the country in fulfilling that anti-avoidance function. He further held that, even if there were a violation of Article 8, it was not within his power to remedy it. The claimant applied to the Administrative Court for judicial review of the Commissioner’s refusal of leave. Before the Administrative Court it was accepted that the only real issue upon which it was sought to quash the Commissioner’s refusal of leave was his consideration of human rights questions.
Held, by the Administrative Court, dismissing the application, that:
1.	having regard to the fact that this was a review of a specialist expert tribunal in the field of detailed social security regulation concerning entitlement to public funds, the test to be applied to avoid unnecessary expense and to achieve the desirable aim of finality was that a very substantial point of law was required (Connolly [1986] 1 WLR 421 and R (Sinclair Gardens) v The Lands tribunal [2005] EWCA Civ 1305, [2006] 3 All ER 650 followed) (paragraphs 4 to 6);
2.	while circumstances could arise where positive obligations are engaged to require the state to provide a disabled person with housing, and to abstain from interference in important aspects of his private and family life, the issues in such matters are fact-specific and depend upon careful factual evaluation of the impact of the decision in question on the individual, and cannot be dealt with in schematic ways by references to the Human Rights Act in written grounds without developing the argument as to how it is suggested that human rights are engaged or infringed in the particular case, or at least how the approach to determination of that question should be developed (Marzari v Italy (1999) 28 EHRR CD175 followed) (paragraph 35);
3.	if the Commissioner had concluded that the application of the regime to the claimant had been a violation of his Article 8 rights, there were a number of remedies open to him, including that of declaring the regulations void (paragraphs 42 to 45);
4.	the Commissioner’s reasons for considering it necessary in the interests of the economic well-being of the country to deny benefit in this case were adequate in the absence of more developed argument, relying particularly upon the impact on the claimant as a disabled person, and the points raised were not sufficiently substantial to meet the test for grant of relief (paragraphs 52 and 53).

The claimants were casual workers who had worked for the same employers in consecutive years for the summer season only. Two cases involved people with a fixed pattern of hours and one had fluctuating hours each week in the season. They had no continuing relationship with their employers and had to apply for a job each summer in competition with others. In each case their claims for jobseeker’s allowance for weeks during the out-of-season months when they had no work or earnings were rejected on the basis that, as they had obtained part-time seasonal employment for more than one year in a row, they were required to be treated as engaged in a “cycle of work” that extended round the whole calendar year. Their actual hours of work during the summer season averaged over the year exceeded 16 hours a week, thus disqualifying them from jobseeker’s allowance at all times because they were held to be in remunerative work. Deciding their appeals and considering R(JSA) 5/03, the tribunal held in all three cases that the claimants had only a “hope” not an “expectation” of being re-employed and were therefore not in a “cycle of work” during the parts of the year when they in fact had no work. The Secretary of State appealed on the ground that the tribunal had misdirected itself in holding it possible to divide the year into two separate cycles for JSA purposes. He held that claimants who have obtained seasonal work for more than one year in a row should be treated as seasonal workers who fall within the definition of remunerative work under regulation 51 of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	 the tribunal did not err in law: a casual worker unable to get a job in the winter months is not “engaged in remunerative work” because of having been able to get casual jobs in the summer of that and one or more previous years. The tribunal’s conclusion about expectation of employment on the facts found was not perverse or unreasonable (paragraphs 14 to 16);
2.	regulation 51(2) is subordinate to regulation 51(1) and even where the calculation provisions of regulation 51(2) apply (as they did in only one of these cases) there is no legal basis for proceeding backwards from the selection of an averaging period for calculating hours to distort the meaning of regulation 51(1) itself as if it contained a deeming provision making people count as engaged in work when they are not (R(JSA) 1/06) (paragraphs 18 to 21 and 27).

The claimant gave her parents £13,000. She subsequently borrowed a further £15,000 and she and her parents then bought a flat in their joint names. The Secretary of State decided that she was not entitled to income support because she had disposed of the £13,000 for the purposes of obtaining income support and should be deemed still to possess it. A tribunal allowed her appeal, deciding that she did not have notional capital, but it did not record a decision on the question whether she possessed actual capital as a result of the purchase of the flat and it did not state that she was entitled to income support. The Secretary of State then made a supersession decision to the effect that the claimant was not entitled to income support because she had actual capital exceeding £8,000 following the purchase of the flat. The claimant appealed on the ground that the issue had been determined in her favour by the first tribunal, which had been aware of all the relevant circumstances. She succeeded before one tribunal but that decision was set aside by a Deputy Commissioner, on the ground that the tribunal had failed to consider whether the Secretary of State’s decision was a proper supersession decision, and her appeal was dismissed by a third tribunal. The claimant made a further appeal. The Chief Social Security Commissioner directed that the appeal be heard by a Tribunal of Commissioners following a request by the Secretary of State, who sought an authoritative ruling as to whether a tribunal hearing an appeal against an “outcome” decision was obliged to substitute another “outcome” decision.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as a tribunal is entitled to cure defects in a decision of the Secretary of State, it is not always necessary for a tribunal to determine the nature of the decision under appeal to it and, in this case, it was sufficient for the third tribunal simply to decide what decision the Secretary of State should have given, taking account of any new evidence available to it (R(IB) 2/04 followed) (paragraph 32);
2.	although regulation 6(2)(a)(i) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 appears to permit the Secretary of State to supersede a decision of a tribunal on the ground that there has been a change of circumstances since the tribunal’s decision took effect, he should not do so where the change of circumstances occurred before the decision that was under appeal to the tribunal and the tribunal was well aware of the change of circumstances and could have taken it into account (paragraph 38);
3.	when an appeal against an outcome decision raises one issue on which the appeal is allowed but it is necessary to deal with a further issue before another outcome decision is substituted, a tribunal may set aside the original outcome decision without substituting another outcome decision, provided it deals with the original issue raised by the appeal and substitutes a decision on that issue; the Secretary of State must then consider the new issue and make an outcome decision giving effect to the tribunal’s decision on the original issue unless, at the time he makes the outcome decision, he is satisfied that there are grounds on which to supersede the tribunal’s decision so as, for instance, to take account of any changes of circumstances that have occurred since he made the decision that was the subject of the appeal to the tribunal (paragraph 48);
4.	in this case, the first tribunal had set aside the first decision of the Secretary of State based on notional capital but had not decided that the claimant was entitled to income support and so it was still open to the Secretary of State to decide that the claimant was not entitled to income support because she possessed actual capital exceeding £8,000 following the purchase of the flat but, as the claimant’s interest in the flat was valued at only £7,650, he and the third tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether her total capital still exceeded £8,000 at the date of his decision (paragraphs 50 to 52).

The claimant was in receipt of housing and council tax benefit for a period of approximately a year. The local authority decided that part of that benefit had been overpaid. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal. The issues in the appeal concerned the expenses which were deductible from the claimant’s self-employed earnings in computing the net profit of her business in accordance with regulation 31 of the Housing benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (and equivalent council tax benefit regulations) as “wholly and exclusively incurred … for the purposes of the employment”. The tribunal allowed the claimant’s appeal and directed the local authority to recalculate the claimant’s entitlement to housing and council tax benefit in accordance with the directions set out in its decision notice, which dealt with the various expenses set out in the claimant’s accounts. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, contending that aspects of the tribunal’s decision were wrong, and that additional amounts of expenditure should have been held deductible. In particular she claimed to deduct from her profits an apportioned amount of the repayments of interest and capital on the loan for the purchase of a replacement car, used partly for business and partly for private purposes. The appeal tribunal had held that no deduction was to be made for the capital repayment on the car loan as the car did not fall under regulation 31(6) as “business equipment or machinery”. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had not erred in the method it had used to calculate the rent payable in respect of the business use of the claimant’s flat by deducting the rent officer’s valuation for a one-bedroomed flat from the actual rent for her two-bedroomed flat (paragraph 12); 
2.	in determining whether any, and if so what, part of the loan interest repayments for the replacement car were expenses “wholly and exclusively incurred … for the purposes of the employment” the principle of apportionment adopted in R(FC) 1/91 applied and the apportionment should be in accordance with the amount of business mileage as a percentage of total mileage in the assessment periods in which the interest was paid (paragraphs 23 to 25);
3.	the same principle of apportionment applied to the capital repayments as to the interest payments because the loan had been used “for the replacement in the course of business of equipment or machinery” within the meaning of regulation 31(6)(a) and it did not matter that the claimant would have replaced the car even if she had not been carrying on a business (paragraphs 26 to 28);
4.	the tribunal had not erred in treating sums of capital that were in the claimant’s accounts for very short periods as capital on which tariff income should be calculated (paragraphs 32 to 34).	
The Commissioner substituted his own decision setting out the further deductions to be made.

The claimant applied for asylum on arrival in the UK on 25 March 2002. On 10 July 2003 he was notified that he had been accepted as a refugee and thus became entitled to claim income support backdated to the date on which he had applied for asylum. Under regulation 21ZB of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as then in force, the time limit for making the claim was 28 days from the date of notification of the asylum decision. He went in person to the Jobcentre with a letter from his solicitor who had advised him (wrongly) that he could claim backdated jobseeker’s allowance or income support. He was awarded jobseeker’s allowance but did not make a valid claim for backdated income support until 9 March 2004. This was refused on the ground that the claim was outside the 28-day time limit. The claimant’s appeal to a tribunal was unsuccessful and he appealed to the Commissioners, arguing that the tribunal had failed to consider backdating under regulation 19(4) and (5) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting an argument concerning alternative claims under regulation 9 of and Schedule 1 to the Claims and Payments Regulations and had failed to deal adequately with his argument that there had been a breach of regulation 4(5) of the Claims and Payments Regulations, which had the effect of disapplying the time limits for making a claim. The Secretary of State’s representative supported the claimant’s contention that the tribunal ought to have considered backdating under regulation 19(4) and (5) on the basis that that the actions taken by the Jobcentre staff might have led him to believe that a claim for income support would not succeed.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	following CI/2000/2004, a breach of regulation 4(5) does not suspend time limits for making a claim: this applies equally to a claim for income support even though an income support claim must be made on a prescribed form (paragraphs 13 and 14);
2.	the tribunal did not have the power to deal with the issue of additional or alternative claims. A claim for backdated jobseeker’s allowance cannot be treated as a claim for backdated income support as claims are only interchangeable if they are specified as such in Schedule 1 to the Claims and Payments Regulations and in any event decisions under regulation 9 are not appealable (paragraph 5(g) of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999) (paragraph 15);
3.	the tribunal did not err in law in failing to consider backdating under regulation 19 as it was not an issue raised by the appeal and therefore did not need to be considered by it (section 12(8)(a) of the Social Security Act 1998) (paragraphs 17 to 19).

The claimant and her husband sold their home to their nephew and then rented it from him, in order to clear mortgage arrears and other debts. They claimed housing benefit in respect of the rent. The local authority refused the claim under regulation 7(1)(h) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 on the ground that the claimant and her husband could have continued to occupy the dwelling without relinquishing ownership. The appeal tribunal confirmed the local authority’s decision. In its reasons the tribunal identified a number of steps the claimant and her husband could have taken to avoid selling their home and found (applying CH/3853/2001) that the claimant and her husband were not under a practical compulsion to sell, although subjectively they may have believed themselves to be. The claimant’s representative applied for leave to appeal, arguing that the proper approach to regulation 7(1)(h) was subjective, not objective. The local authority argued that the test required a simple factual analysis of the options available in the circumstances and that the claimant’s knowledge, belief or reasoning was irrelevant.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 7(1)(h) contains both subjective and objective elements, the test being, as held in CH/3853/2001, one of practical possibility as applied to the particular circumstances of the claimant (paragraphs 14 and 15);
2.	it is impossible in the normal use of language to interpret “could not” to mean “believed she could not” and, apart from exceptional circumstances, such as extreme stress, where the claimant’s perceptions might limit the options available, the claimant’s perceptions are not relevant to the application of the test (paragraphs 17 to 19).

The parent with care applied for a departure direction on the ground that the non-resident parent’s lifestyle was inconsistent with his declared income. The Secretary of State directed that the application should be referred to an appeal tribunal, which also had before it an appeal by the parent with care against the original maintenance assessment. Before the appeal was heard, the parent with care advised the Child Support Agency (CSA) that she had come to an arrangement with her ex-husband and therefore no longer wanted any action taken against him. This agreement subsequently broke down and the tribunal hearing of both matters took place; the appeal was dismissed but the departure direction application succeeded. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that the tribunal had been wrong to hold that the application for a departure direction had not been withdrawn and also that the hearing had been unfair. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal holding (i) that, even if the parent with care had indicated to the CSA a wish to withdraw the application, the withdrawal was not effective unless it was withdrawn by the Secretary of State and (ii) the non-resident parent had had adequate opportunity to deal with the points at issue and there had been no suggestion that he could have said anything further on the subject that might have made a difference. The non-resident parent applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Held, refusing the application, that:
1.	following Cooke v Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 734 (also reported as R(DLA) 6/01), where the two-tier appeal structure could deal expertly with a specialised area of law, the Court should approach with special caution the granting of permission to appeal, recognising the expertise of the Commissioner in applying the principles of the relevant legislation (paragraphs 10 and 11);
2.	the Child Support Act 1991 section 28D referred only to the withdrawal of an application before the matter had been referred to an appeal tribunal. Regulation 40(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 made it clear that only the Secretary of State can withdraw an application after he has referred it to the appeal tribunal. The Commissioner was therefore correct and there was no prospect of persuading the Court of Appeal to the contrary (paragraphs 12 to 15);
3.	the Commissioner had rejected the complaints about the fairness of the hearing for sound reasons and there was no prospect of that ground of appeal succeeding before the full court (paragraph 22).

Capital – value of a joint tenant’s interest in a house – whether always half the net capital value – need to make full enquiry into relevant circumstances
The claimant applied for income support, declaring that she owned the former matrimonial home with her husband, who still lived there. As she had no intention of selling the house or starting divorce proceedings, she relied on R(IS) 1/03 to assert that she should not be regarded as having any interest in the house for benefit purposes. The claim was nevertheless refused on the ground that she had capital worth half the net value of the house. She appealed and the Secretary of State submitted to the tribunal that none of the disregards of capital in Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 applied. The tribunal upheld her appeal. The Secretary of State asked for the decision to be set aside but was instead granted permission to appeal. He argued before the Commissioner that the tribunal did not have the full facts before it so should not have decided as it did. Following a direction from the Commissioner to make a submission on R(IS) 1/03, the Secretary of State said that it was irrelevant. The claimant’s solicitors in response raised in addition the issue that the claimant might only have a future interest in the property and referred to R(IS) 1/97.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was wrong in law in failing to establish the full facts before deciding whether any of the disregards of capital in Schedule 10 applied, paragraphs 4, 5 and 25 being potentially relevant. The facts necessary to decide paragraphs 4 and 25 were whether the claimant was estranged from her husband, when the estrangement occurred and if her husband was a lone parent (paragraphs 18 and 33(1));
2.	the facts necessary to decide paragraph 5 were the arrangements concerning the husband’s continued occupation of the property. If they were of the kind considered in R(IS) 1/97 the claimant might have had no current interest in the property. R(IS) 1/03 excluded any additional rights she might have had were she to take matrimonial proceedings (paragraph 23 and 33(2) and (3));
3.	the Secretary of State was wrong in assuming the claimant had capital worth half the net value of the whole house and failed to establish whether the claimant held the property with her husband as a joint tenant or a tenant in common. Following Hourigan v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 1890, [2003] 1 WLR 608 (also reported as R(IS) 4/03), applying regulation 49, the claimant’s interest as a joint tenant to title to her “half” of the house should have been valued. The valuation should have been the current market value of the claimant’s “half” of the house sold at the date of the decision under appeal, with her husband in it as of right and not willing to buy her out or to sell, in conjunction with her, his “half” of the house (CIS/3197/2003 and R(JSA) 1/02 followed). If the claimant’s interest was as a tenant in common, Hourigan was directly relevant (paragraphs 24 to 31 and 33(4)).
The Commissioner remitted the appeal to a differently constituted tribunal to decide on the facts.

A former gunner in the Royal Artillery claimed disablement benefit under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 (“the 1983 Service Pensions Order”, now replaced by the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006, “the 2006 Service Pensions Order”) in respect of bilateral noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss, a duodenal ulcer and a depressive disorder. A gratuity of £4,304 was paid in respect of the ulcer only, based on an assessment of six to 14 per cent from 9 October 2001 for life (final). He appealed and was awarded a further £3,356 on the basis of a combined interim assessment of 15 to 19 per cent for the ulcer and the depressive disorder. On a further appeal the assessment was increased to 20 per cent for the period from 9 October 2001 to 20 July 2006, the 20 per cent being an interim assessment entitling him to a pension rather than a gratuity. It was decided under article 55 of the 1983 Service Pensions Order, now article 52 of the 2006 Order, to withhold the weekly pension payments until approximately 15 August 2007 in order to recover the gratuities already paid in respect of the same period. The claimant appealed against the decision to withhold the pension. His appeal was dismissed on the ground that the Secretary of State had acted reasonably and he therefore appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in apparently confining itself to reviewing the reasonableness of the Secretary of State’s decision rather than substituting its own judgment (paragraph 8);
2.	generally a gratuity that has been replaced by a pension should be treated as having been paid on account of the pension and should be recovered by withholding the pension until the gratuity has been recovered, although there may be circumstances where part of the pension should be paid with the result that the gratuity will be recovered over a longer period (paragraphs 14 and 17);
3.	if disablement were to be assessed at less than 20 per cent after the end of the interim assessment, a gratuity should be calculated as though the original gratuities had never been awarded but there should then be withheld under article 52 of the 2006 Service Pensions Order an amount equal to such amount of the original gratuities as had not already been set off against the award of pension (paragraph 22).
The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal but substituted his own decision to the same effect.

The claimant was awarded housing benefit in August 2003, based on his entitlement to income support, and payment was made to his landlord’s agent as authorised by the claimant. His entitlement to income support ceased on 28 May 2004 when he was taken into legal custody, but the local authority was not informed, and an overpayment of housing benefit arose, which it was decided should be recovered from the agent as “the person to whom it was paid” within the meaning of section 75(3)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The agent appealed, arguing that a decision to recover the overpayment should not be directed to it. The tribunal allowed the appeal, applying the law of agency to find that the overpayment was not recoverable from the agent because it was an agent for another to whom it had accounted for all monies received. The authority appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that it was the clear intention of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 that it was proper for an authority to seek recovery from an agent if that was the “person” to whom payments were made. Neither the agent nor the authority took any further part in the proceedings, the authority relying on the Secretary of State’s representations. The Secretary of State argued that section 75(3)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 should not be read as being subject to the law of agency, following R(IS) 3/07, because the overpayment provisions in the legislation disapplied the law of agency. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the secondary legislation (the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 and the Housing Benefit (Recovery of Overpayments) Regulations 1997) demonstrates a clear intention to include an agent within the definition of landlord, effectively without distinction (paragraph 20);
2.	the reference to “person” in section 75(3) must be taken as being wide enough to encompass both a natural person and an incorporated company (Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978) and both a landlord and an agent, and therefore the secondary legislation is intra vires and entitled to treat the landlord and his agent interchangeably by virtue of the primary legislation (paragraphs 22 to 24);
3.	the overpayment was therefore recoverable from the agent notwithstanding that it might have accounted to its principal, the landlord, for such sum or part of it (paragraphs 1 and 24).

The claimant, who had mental health problems, was renting accommodation in a shared house owned by a company, which also provided support services through another company within the same group. She was receiving housing benefit, which included an amount for services. The group was acquired by another group of companies, which retained responsibility for support services, but the reversion on the tenancies of the property was transferred out of the group to a housing association (Reside). Reside granted the claimant a new tenancy at an increased rent and asked the local authority to meet the new rent on the basis that the rent eligible for housing benefit was exempt from the rent restrictions imposed by the version of regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 in force since 2 January 1996. The savings provision to those Regulations in regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1995 defines exempt accommodation as including accommodation provided by certain bodies where the landlord or a person acting on its behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. The local authority restricted the eligible rent to the local reference rent, applying the current version of regulation 11 on the ground that the exemption did not apply, since it did not accept that Reside or a person acting on its behalf provided the claimant with care, support or supervision. The claimant and other tenants in the same position appealed. Reside accepted, following R(H) 2/07, that the support must be provided directly by the landlord, but maintained that it provided some direct support through its tenant liaison officer. The tribunal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the definition of “exempt accommodation” required that the landlord be the main provider of care, support or supervision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was wrong to read into the definition of exempt accommodation a requirement that the landlord be the main provider of care, support or supervision, since, had any such limitation been intended, it could and would have been made expressly (paragraph 21);
2.	for the same reason, it was not possible to read into the definition a requirement that the care, support or supervision be provided pursuant to a contractual or statutory obligation on the part of the landlord (paragraph 22);
3.	in order to satisfy the definition the care, support or supervision which the landlord provided must be more than minimal (Sharratt v London Central Bus Co Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 718, [2003] 1 WLR 2487, [2003] All ER 590  followed) (paragraph 23);
4.	on the facts of this case it was not possible to conclude that such support as the tenant liaison officer was able to provide to the claimant was anything more than minimal (paragraph 29).

Following a claim for jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) on 24 January 2005, the claimant signed a jobseeker’s agreement on 31 January 2005 “under duress”, his main disagreement being whether he should make himself available for work on Saturdays as well as Monday to Friday and about the total number of weekly hours of availability. He was awarded JSA. On 7 February he applied to vary the terms of the agreement, but all the proposed changes were rejected except for a maximum of 40 hours’ availability. At a further interview on 7 March, an unaltered agreement was presented to him which he did not sign, signing instead a form restricting his availability to eight hours a day between 9am and 6pm from Monday to Friday. On 31 March two decisions were made, the first superseding the award of JSA with effect from 7 March on the ground that the claimant was not available for employment from that date and the second determining that the claimant’s proposed variation of 7 February would not satisfy the availability for work condition and also directing a variation of the original agreement to 40 hours’ availability instead of 54. The claimant did not sign the proposed revised agreement but appealed both decisions. The tribunal concluded that the claimant did not have reasonable prospects of securing employment on the pattern of availability imposed from 7 March 2005 and disallowed both appeals, rejecting most of the claimant’s proposed variations but allowing the exclusion of customer service occupations from the types of job to be looked for. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the effect of regulation 7(2)(b) of the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996 is that, if a claimant has put restrictions on the hours or days of availability and the actual pattern of availability is not the same as or less restrictive than the pattern of availability recorded in the jobseeker's agreement, the claimant is not available for work regardless of having reasonable prospects of securing employment on the actual pattern of availability (paragraphs 14 to 18);
2.	the Secretary of State or an appeal tribunal can direct that a varied agreement should take effect retrospectively. If the variation took effect before the date of the first decision under appeal, the circumstances obtaining at the date of the decision under appeal were altered and the actual pattern of availability should then have been tested against the pattern of availability recorded in the retrospectively varied jobseeker’s agreement. The tribunal therefore erred in its decision on the second appeal in not further investigating the grounds of the appeal and in not considering the date from which any varied agreement signed in pursuance of its direction was to take effect (paragraph 20 to 24).
The Commissioner set aside the tribunal’s decision on both appeals and directed that the jobseeker’s agreement of 31 January be varied to exclude customer service and to substitute the term that the claimant be available for work Mondays to Fridays between 9am and 6pm, subject to an overall maximum of 40 hours weekly. Further consideration of the appeal on the first decision was adjourned pending the claimant having the opportunity to enter into a valid agreement as above.

In 2006 her benefit stopped; the reason given was that she was a sponsored immigrant whose five-year sponsorship started on 30 November 2002 and she was therefore not entitled to pension credit until 30 November 2007. She sent the Pension Service her British passport and naturalisation certificate but the decision was unchanged and she appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
Under section 2(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971, all British citizens have a right of abode in the UK. Section 3(1)(c)(ii), which allows the Secretary of State to impose conditions requiring individuals to maintain and accommodate themselves and their dependants without recourse to public funds, expressly applies only “where a person is not a British citizen” ie to those without a right of abode. A British Citizen can never be regarded as a sponsored immigrant or barred for that reason from public funds.

The claimant had made a claim for tax credits as a single person on behalf of herself and her child. Evidence subsequently emerged that the claimant was living as part of an unmarried couple and as a result it was decided that she was not entitled to tax credits. The claimant appealed to a tribunal which upheld the appeal to a limited extent and remitted the case to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to recalculate her entitlement as part of an unmarried couple. HMRC appealed to the Commissioner on the basis that the tribunal had erred in applying the provisions of section 16 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (the Act), which deals with awards of tax credit, rather than section 19 of that Act which deals with entitlement.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	section 3(3)(a) which deals with claims by couples and section 3(3)(b) which deals with claims by single persons are mutually exclusive (CTC/3864/2004 cited with approval) (paragraphs 14 and 16); 
2.	a cohabitee who had not been a party to a claim for a tax credit could not be treated as having applied for a tax credit and to have acquired potential liabilities arising from the claim. Section 3 of the Act did not allow the tribunal to remit the case to HMRC for amendment on that basis (paragraph 16);
3. 	section 16 of the Act provides that awards of tax credit can be amended or terminated. However the decisions in this case were made under section 19(3) of the Act which relates to entitlement only (paragraph 18).

The claimant was refused both components of DLA on the basis of her claim pack and a report from her GP. She appealed and was examined by an examining medical practitioner (EMP). The decision-maker reconsidered the decision in the light of the EMP’s report and again disallowed the claim. The claimant appealed and the tribunal disallowed the appeal, preferring the evidence of the EMP to that put forward on behalf of the claimant. Before the Commissioner the claimant’s representative argued that the tribunal’s decision should be set aside on the ground of apparent bias, the EMP having previously sat as a tribunal member. He had sat with the chairman of the tribunal on three previous occasions in the two years preceding the tribunal hearing, the last occasion being three and a half months before. The question for the Commissioner was whether the systemic approach set out in Lawal v Northern Spirit Ltd [2003] UKHL 35, [2003] ICR 856, was applicable or whether the issue of bias should be decided on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. The Secretary of State argued that, following the latter approach, the decision of the Inner House in Secretary of State v Cunningham (R(DLA) 7/04) was distinguishable, as the combination of frequency, timing and length of the relationship in the present case was not sufficient to give rise to the perception on the part of a fair-minded and informed observer that there was a real possibility of sub-conscious bias. (The test for apparent bias set out at [103] in Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67, [2002] 2 AC 357).
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the situation in Lawal of a lawyer addressing a tribunal, one or two members of which he had previously chaired, was distinguishable from the case of a tribunal having to consider evidence from someone with whom one of the tribunal members had previously sat, which required an analysis of all the surrounding circumstances; and CSDLA/364/2005* was incorrect in holding to the contrary (Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Limited [1999] EWCA Civ 3004 and Porter v Magill followed) (paragraph 12); 
2.	applying that approach to the present case, the lapse of time between the three occasions was not sufficient to destroy the objection of apparent bias altogether and any doubts should be resolved by setting the decision of the tribunal aside (paragraphs 15 and 16).
The Commissioner remitted the case for rehearing by a differently constituted tribunal.

The claimant was medically discharged from the Royal Air Force in 1965 on a diagnosis of “simple schizophrenia” and was notified that his deemed claim for war disablement pension had been refused on the ground that his condition was not attributable to or aggravated by service. In 2004 that decision was reviewed and he was awarded a war disablement pension from 1 February 1976 for the condition of “depressive episode” accepted as attributable to service. The review decision cited R v Secretary of State for Social Security ex parte Edwards (10 July 1992) (CO/2281/90) as authority for treating 1 February 1976 as the date when medical opinion changed in respect to the link between schizophrenia and ordinary life events. He appealed on the issue of the commencement date. No evidence of the development of medical opinion was provided for the tribunal and it dismissed his appeal, simply recording its agreement with the Secretary of State’s written reasons for choice of commencement date. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in the absence of any references to the relevant scientific material in the statement of case the tribunal’s statement of reasons in this case was manifestly inadequate (paragraph 12);
2.	if the stated basis of the review decision as a change in medical opinion within paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 3 was correct, the award should have been backdated by no more than three years under paragraph 6(1)(b) of Schedule 3 (paragraph 16);
3.	however, the acceptance of the condition of “depressive episode” made it improbable that the review in this case was connected to the development of scientific understanding in relation to the severity of stress required to precipitate schizophrenia and backdating was possible only if there was reliance on erroneous medical advice constituting “official error” within sub-paragraph 6A of paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 (paragraphs 17 and 18);
4.	the question of whether the decision arose from an official error must be decided on the basis of medical knowledge as it was at the time the decision was made (R v Secretary of State for Social Security ex parte Foe (7 November 1995) followed) and applying the standards to be expected of a reasonably competent medical practitioner in the light of psychiatric knowledge in 1965, it would be necessary to demonstrate some clear and obvious mistake which resulted in the decision refusing entitlement (R(SB) 2/93 and R(H) 2/04 followed) (paragraphs 19 to 21).

The claimant had authorised the payment of housing benefit to her landlord under regulation 96(1)(a) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. In January 2006, at the claimant’s request, the local authority decided to stop payments to the landlord and pay benefit instead into the bank account of a friend of the claimant, but it did not notify the landlord of its decision. In April 2006 the landlord contacted the local authority and the authority accepted that it was required by regulation 95(1)(b) to make payments to the landlord because the claimant was more than eight weeks in arrears with her rent. The authority reinstated direct payments to the landlord. The landlord appealed to an appeal tribunal, arguing that payment should be made to him under regulation 95(1)(b) for the period from January to April. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, holding that there was no power to order a second payment of housing benefit to the landlord. The landlord appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was common ground, on the authority of CH/2986/2005, that: (i) the decision to pay housing benefit to the claimant should have been made on a supersession; (ii) the supersession decision should have been notified to the landlord; (iii) it carried a right of appeal by the landlord; and (iv) it was that decision which was under appeal to the tribunal.
This case was heard together with R(H) 1/08, which raised the same issue.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the absence of any provision for recovery of the payment made in error to the tenant did not prevent a payment being made to the landlord for the same period, since the recovery provisions follow on in their effect from the entitlement provisions, and cannot have any effect by relation back on what payments may be made (paragraph 29);
2.	it was possible that entitlement to a retrospective payment to the landlord might arise since a decision on revision or supersession is a decision dealing with all aspects of entitlement (R(I) 9/63 followed) and it would have been open to the local authority or the tribunal to make a retrospective decision on revision that included the payment of the benefit to the landlord (paragraphs 30 to 37);
3.	however that result was prevented by regulation 98, which provides that any sum paid in respect of a period covered by a subsequent decision shall be offset against arrears of entitlement under the subsequent decision treated as properly paid on account of them (paragraphs 39 and 40).

Housing benefit – payment to landlord – whether local authority has power to suspend payment pending decision whether to pay to landlord
The claimant became a tenant of the landlord’s property in October 2004. He claimed and was awarded housing benefit. The landlord informed the local authority in March 2005 that arrears of rent equivalent to more than eight weeks or more had accumulated. That raised the issue whether the local authority should pay housing benefit direct to the landlord, as required by regulation 95(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations, subject to an exception where it was “in the overriding interests of the claimant not to make direct payments to the landlord”. The local authority decided, on the basis of information from the tenant, without reference to the landlord, that it was in the overriding interests of the claimant to continue to pay the housing benefit to him. The landlord appealed and a tribunal allowed his appeal. The local authority appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner the local authority argued that the local authority’s decision under regulation 95(1)(b) was discretionary and that (relying on CH/4108/2005) it should have limited itself to considering whether the decision under appeal was defective on judicial review grounds. The issue also arose as to whether the local authority could have suspended payment pending enquiries of the landlord. 
The case additionally raised the same issue as R(H) 2/08 as to whether it was possible to make payment of housing benefit in respect of the same entitlement for the same period to both the claimant and the landlord. By agreement at the hearing, that issue was dealt with in R(H)/2/08.
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	regulation 95(1) gives a local authority a duty, not a discretion and provides both a test for the relevance of the factors taken into account and a touchstone for the exercise of the judgment on those factors, which allow a tribunal to undertake an independent reconsideration of whether the exception applies rather than merely a consideration of whether the decision-maker approached the issue properly in judicial review terms (R(IB) 2/04 followed; R(H) 6/06 distinguished; CH/4108/2005 not followed) (paragraphs 14 to 18);
2.	a change in payee involves the revision or supersession of an award (see R(H) 2/08), and accordingly, regulation 11(2)(a)(ii) of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 permits the suspension of payment of housing benefit while enquiries are made concerning the person to whom the benefit should be paid (paragraphs 19 to 29);
3.	(applying R(H) 2/08) it is not possible to make payment of housing benefit in respect of the same entitlement for the same period to both the claimant and the landlord  and the tribunal should have so decided (paragraph 32).
The Commissioner therefore substituted his own decision in similar terms to R(H) 2/08.

The claimant was receiving war disablement pension with an allowance for lowered standard of occupation (ALSO) at the maximum rate in accordance with what is now article 15 of the Naval, Military and Armed Forces Etc (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006. One condition of entitlement was that he was incapable of following any occupation other than his regular service occupation with equivalent gross income. On review the Secretary of State decided that he was no longer entitled to ALSO because his earnings from his current occupation were now higher than those in his regular service occupation. The claimant appealed. The question for the tribunal and for the Commissioner on further appeal was whether his London weighting allowance in his present occupation should count as part of his gross income for calculating ALSO. The claimant argued that London weighting was a temporary payment and should be excluded from the calculation of earning capacity just as certain temporary payments (non-skills-based allowances) were excluded from the calculation of service pay. The Secretary of State argued that the London weighting was not a temporary allowance and was part of  “gross income” in the natural and ordinary meaning of that term. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as a  matter of fairness and equity there was a requirement to compare like with like (R v Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Humphreys [1966] 2 QB 1 (also reported as appendix to R(I) 2/66) followed) (paragraph 27);
2.	the distinction is not between temporary and permanent but between what is a normal part of the claimant’s income and what is not (R(I) 1/72 followed) (paragraph 28);
3.	following that approach, the hypothetical comparison should be made between the claimant’s normal pay in his current occupation, including the London weighting allowance, and what he would normally be paid in his regular occupation if carried out in the location of the comparator occupation for as long as the comparator occupation has been carried out there, thus including the service recruitment and retention allowance (London) (paragraph 29);
4.	in calculating the income from the regular occupation the prospect of promotion to a different rank or a shift to a different pay scale should not be taken into account as it would in fact be assuming a different regular occupation from that followed at the relevant date (paragraph 32).
The Commissioner set aside the tribunal’s decision and referred the case to a differently constituted tribunal with directions.

The claimant’s tenancy started on Saturday 27 August 2005 but he did not move in until 31 August, which fell in the next benefit week. He had claimed housing benefit on 12 July 2005 and advised the council of his occupation on 2 September. He was notified on 14 September 2005 that housing benefit would start on Monday 5 September and appealed against the decision not to award benefit from 27 August. The council argued that it was required to apply the general rule in regulation 65(1) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, that a person who makes a claim and is otherwise entitled, is entitled to benefit from the benefit week following the date on which the claim is made or treated as made, and that, following Secretary of State v Robinson and Sunderland [2004] EWCA Civ 342, [2004] HLR 39 (also reported as R(H) 4/04), the claim should be treated as made on 31 August and not before. The tribunal agreed, stating that there was no discretion. On the claimant’s further appeal, a Commissioner directed the Secretary of State to be joined as a respondent on the issue whether the claimant could be assisted by regulation 72(11). Before the Commissioner, the Secretary of State and the council disagreed, the council contending that under regulation 72(11) the claim could be treated as made in the week before the benefit week starting on Monday 5 September (leading to the same decision as the one made) and the Secretary of State contending that the claim could be treated as made in the week before the week in which the claimant met all the relevant conditions, and that, all the relevant conditions having been met on 31 August, the claim could be treated as made in the week starting on 22 August. It was common ground that regulation 65(2) (exception for new tenancies where liability first arises in the benefit week in which the claim is made or treated as made) did not apply to the actual date of claim.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was wrong to say as a general statement of law that there was no discretion, since there was a potential discretion to treat the claim as an advance claim, reading regulation 65 with regulation 72(11) (paragraph 29);
2.	regulation 65(1) is subject to regulation 65(2) and, once regulation 72(11) has been applied to give an assumed date of claim, regulation 65(2) must be considered in relation to that assumed date. Robinson was to be distinguished as being predicated on the approach that regulation 72(11) did not apply in that case on the facts (paragraphs 31 to 42);
3.	however regulation 72(11) did not assist the claimant on the facts, as regulation 65(2) was not satisfied on the assumption applied from regulation 72(11), and so, although the approach the council took was wrong in law, its decision was correct (paragraphs 43 to 44).

The claimant was dismissed on 15 March 1994 following a long period of suspension and disciplinary proceedings and was awarded benefits from 17 March 1994. He made a statutory claim for compensation for unfair dismissal, which was successful. He then started civil proceedings against his former employers for damages for psychiatric injury. While those proceedings were pending, the House of Lords delivered its judgment in Johnson v Unisys Limited [2001] UKHL 13, [2003] 1 AC 518, [2001] ICR 480, in which it upheld the striking out of a claim for damages arising out of the manner of dismissal of an employee whose complaint of unfair dismissal had been upheld by an industrial tribunal. In the light of Johnson, the claimant applied to amend his Statement of Claim by claiming only in respect of events which had occurred prior to his dismissal. His case was eventually heard by the House of Lords together with Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc [2004] UKHL 35, [2005] 1 AC 503, [2004] ICR 1064. The House of Lords there held that the principle that damages cannot be recovered in respect of matters within the scope of an unfair dismissal claim (the “Johnson exclusion zone”) did not prevent the claimant from pursuing his claim for damages in respect of psychiatric injury caused by his employer’s treatment of him before his dismissal. An award of damages was then agreed and the Secretary of State issued a certificate in respect of benefits paid to the claimant in the period from 17 March 1994 to 16 March 1999. The compensators appealed on the ground that the alleged injury in respect of which benefit had been paid had in fact been caused by the claimant’s dismissal, and so, as a result of Johnson, lay outside the scope of the damages claim. The tribunal upheld the appeal, finding that the process of dismissal started in September 2003 and that on the basis of medical evidence the claimant’s psychiatric injuries started after that date. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the boundary between the common law and statutory claims was defined by the matters which lay within the scope of the common law and statutory claims respectively and so, since the employment tribunal does not have power to make an award in respect of non-pecuniary loss, such as mental injury caused to the claimant by events prior to and leading up to his dismissal, the tribunal was in error in seeking to identify a point in time prior to the dismissal at which the process of dismissal could be said to have begun (paragraphs 21 to 23);
2.	once a compensator makes a payment in respect of a claim that a specific injury has occurred in a particular way, it is not open to the compensator to assert in the compensation recovery proceedings that the claimant in fact suffered some other injury, or suffered the injury asserted in the claim in some way other than that alleged (CCR/2232/2006 followed) (paragraph 24);
3.	on that basis the post-traumatic stress disorder which began in May 1993 was an effective cause of the claimant’s illness throughout the period while he was in receipt of relevant benefits and therefore the tribunal was bound to find that the injury alleged in the amended Statement of Claim was and remained an effective cause of the payment of benefit throughout the relevant period (paragraph 26);
4.	the relevant period of recoverable benefits was therefore the period from 13 May 1993 to 12 May 1998 (paragraph 27).
The Commissioner directed the Secretary of State to issue a fresh certificate and re-calculate the amount of recoverable benefit accordingly.

The claimant was the registered proprietor of the freehold estate in a terraced house, registered with absolute title. The property was divided into three dwellings and 99-year leases were granted by the claimant of each of the dwellings, those leases being also registered estates. The lease of the ground floor flat was granted to the claimant’s former partner at a rent of £50 per annum, rising to £100. The claimant occupied the flat pursuant to an agreement under which he was liable to pay his former partner a substantial weekly rent and sought to claim housing benefit in respect of that liability. Housing benefit was refused and the claimant appealed. The tribunal upheld the council’s decision on the ground that the claimant was the “owner” of the dwelling and was therefore precluded from entitlement to housing benefit in respect of the rent he was liable to pay for his occupation of it. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that although he was the owner of the freehold he did not have the right to dispose of the fee simple of any of the leased properties and therefore could not be described as the owner of the flat he occupied. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
The payments of rent by the claimant were “payments by an owner” within the meaning of regulation 10(2)(c) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987. “Owner” is defined by the Regulations as the person who is entitled to dispose of the fee simple and the claimant was entitled to do so, albeit subject to the lease.

Payment – offset under regulation 5 of the Social Security (Payments on account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988 – whether arrears resulting from the suspension of payments pending the making of an award superseding a previous award can be offset against an overpayment arising as a result of the subsequent award
The claimant suffered from autism and received DLA middle care and lower mobility components. In September 2001 he began boarding at a residential college funded by the Learning and Skills Council, continuing to live with his parents during school holidays and half-terms. He was therefore not entitled to the care component except during the vacation periods. When the change of circumstance came to light, on renewal of the DLA claim by SB’s father on 27 May 2003, the payment of the care component was suspended under regulation 16(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 pending investigation. A decision was issued on 13 October 2003, described as superseding the award of 14 July 2000, ruling that no care component was to be paid for the period SB was in the residential home and that any DLA already paid should be treated as paid on account of that benefit awarded. The suspension was lifted but no payments were made of the care component unpaid since May 2003. On January 2004 the overpayment was found not to be recoverable but calculated to include the amount of care component due for the summer of 2003 (£529) as a sum which could be offset against the overpayment. The tribunal, on appeal from the claimant’s father, upheld the decision that the overpayment was not recoverable; this involved also upholding the decision that the arrears due could be offset against the overpayment although the tribunal’s reasons did not address this issue. The claimant appealed and the Secretary of State requested that the Commissioner address the legitimacy of offsetting the sum relating to the later period against the overpayment held to be irrecoverable. The Commissioner accepted the Secretary of State’s argument that regulation 5 of the Social Security (Payments on account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988 (the Regulations) entitled the decision-maker to offset the arrears and dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It had been argued at all stages by both parties that the October decision superseded the original decision with retrospective effect and both parties sought a determination as to the proper construction of regulation 5 on that basis. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 5(1) allows for overpayments to be offset against “arrears” of entitlement “under the subsequent determination”. However the Regulations were passed pursuant to section 71(6)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 which empowers the Regulations to deal with “arrears” payable “by virtue of the subsequent determination”. The sum in this case was in arrears, not by virtue of the subsequent determination on entitlement but by virtue of the decision to suspend payments and/or by virtue of a delay in reaching a decision as to the amount of the overpayment (paragraphs 24 to 26);
2.	regulation 16(3) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 draws the line at allowing recovery of recoverable overpayments against arrears due to suspension of payments and, while the same distinction is not drawn in the 1988 Regulations in relation to non-recoverable overpayments, any interpretation should reach a logical result which will not be seen as arbitrary or capricious (paragraphs 27 and 28);
3.	even if the decision of October 2003 had entirely replaced the July 2000 decision, the entitlement to £529 for the summer months was not arrears of entitlement under (or by virtue of) the subsequent decision, but was arrears by virtue of the suspension of payment directed in May 2003. The determination in October 2003 was simply determining that, during the period of overpayment, that overpayment should be being treated as paying on account that now held to be due (but in arrears) over that same period (paragraph 30).

The claimant suffered gunshot wounds while serving in the Army in 1954. His discharge in 1957 was not on medical grounds, so there was no deemed claim for pension in 1954. He later went to live abroad and did not claim a war pension until 1997. The conditions “gunshot wound to chest and abdomen” and “generalised anxiety disorder” were accepted as attributable to service and on 24 September 1998 he was awarded a pension with effect from December 1996 on an assessment of 20 per cent. That award was increased to 40 per cent by an appeal tribunal on 17 August 2001. In July 2004 the claimant made a claim in respect of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Veterans Agency accepted PTSD as an additional condition attributable to service and made an award on that basis with effect from 16 July 2004, but maintaining the assessment of disablement at 40 per cent. The claimant appealed against the commencement date of the award. It was argued on his behalf that the Secretary of State’s failure to take reasonable steps to make available war pensions information to ex-service personnel abroad had caused the claimant’s delay in claiming a pension, and that (following Secretary of State for Defence v Reid [2004] EWHC 1271) the award should therefore be backdated under paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 (since replaced by the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006). The tribunal dismissed his appeal and he appealed to the Commissioner. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 required that the act or omission of the Secretary of State was and continued to be the dominant cause of the delay up to the moment the claim or application was made, and since the appellant must have been aware of the war pensions scheme when he made his claim in 1997, any failure by the Secretary of State to make ex-servicemen living abroad aware of the scheme could not have caused the appellant’s failure to make a claim in respect of PTSD until July 2004 (paragraph 16);
2.	however, the decision in 2004 must have been made in the exercise of the Secretary of State’s review powers rather than on a new claim, since the claimant was alleging a misdiagnosis or misdescription of his original disablement, rather than any new or additional impairment of body or mind (R(AF) 1/07 followed), and the award could therefore be backdated to the date of effect of the original decision on the ground of official error under the provisions now contained in paragraph 1(7) of Schedule 3 to the 2006 Service Pensions Order (paragraph 23);
3.	the appeal tribunal of 17 August 2001 was concerned only with the assessment issue and therefore article 44(3) of the 2006 Service Pensions Order did not operate to limit the grounds for a subsequent review of the entitlement decision (paragraph 24);
4.	the tribunal had therefore erred in law in failing to consider whether the decision of 24 September 1998 was, or should have been, reviewed on the ground of official error, so as to entitle the appellant to backdating of his award in respect of PTSD to the date of the original awarding decision (although that would not lead to an increase of pension) (paragraph 25).
The Commissioner remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal to decide the issue of whether the failure to diagnose the appellant as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder arose from official error, in accordance with the principles set out in R(AF) 5/07.

The claimant failed the personal capability assessment, scoring no points on the physical descriptors and only three on the mental health descriptors. He appealed and the tribunal increased the number of mental health points from three to five, insufficient to establish incapacity for work. It also considered regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 but found that there was no evidence that the claimant would be a substantial risk to the mental or physical health of any person if he were found capable of work. The claimant appealed further to a Commissioner, who decided that the tribunal had erred in failing to give adequate reasons for its conclusion. He determined that the claimant suffered from a specific disease or disablement, namely alcohol dependency syndrome and considered whether that gave rise to a substantial risk, concluding that the assessment of the risk must depend to some extent on the kind of work the claimant might be asked to do, taking into account what he had done in the past, what he was doing at the time of the decision and what his qualifications were. It was necessary, in order to satisfy regulation 27(b), to show a link between the work and the risk. That was not present. On application, the Commissioner gave leave to appeal limited to regulation 27 issues. On the application being renewed before the Court of Appeal, the Court declined to extend the permission to appeal. The claimant appealed, challenging the Commissioner’s interpretation of regulation 27(b) and arguing that it was sufficient to demonstrate risks either to his own or to another’s safety whether at home or at work. In addition he argued that a decision-maker must identify the type of work which a claimant could perform assuming he had been found capable of work and that the Commissioner’s identification of the type of work he might be expected to undertake was too vague and too broad. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the need to consider regulation 27(b) only arises where the own occupation test or the personal capability assessment have not been satisfied. Therefore the risk to be assessed must arise as a consequence of work the claimant would be found capable of undertaking but for regulation 27. The Commissioner was correct in the question he decided, namely whether a substantial risk should be foreseen in the light of the work the claimant might be expected to perform in the hypothetical workplace in which he might be expected to be (paragraph 33 to 35);
2.	the correct approach to assessment of the type of work for the purposes of the regulation is to consider the nature of any health risks posed by the disease or the disablement in the context of workplaces the claimant might find himself in, with a view to answering the question whether any such risk is substantial, ie to assess the range or type of work which a claimant is capable of performing sufficiently to assess the risk to health either to himself or to others (CIB/360/2007 followed). The Commissioner’s conclusion that the claimant could do some work without risk to himself or others is consistent with the obligation imposed by the Regulation and he was under no obligation to go further than he did (paragraphs 45 and 49).

The claimant owned a two bedroom, ground floor flat and his parents owned, but did not occupy, the flat above. In 2003 the claimant, who now had nine children, made an informal agreement with his parents to extend his occupation into the flat above, using the upstairs flat for sleeping accommodation and the downstairs one for general living purposes. The properties remained self-contained units valued as separate hereditaments for rating and council tax purposes: the local authority allowed council tax benefit on the first flat only. The claimant appealed and the tribunal accepted that the family occupied both properties as their home and that the claimant was liable for council tax on both properties but concluded that, as the two flats were on the valuation list as two separate units they could not be classed as a single hereditament. It held that the legislation did not provide for council tax benefit to be paid for two separate dwellings and therefore upheld the local authority’s decision, holding that the main residence was flat 1 and the claimant could not therefore qualify for benefit on flat 2. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that he occupied both flats together as one combined residence, which was his sole or main residence. The question before the Commissioner was whether (for both liability and benefit purposes alike) a person could be a “resident” in terms of section 6(5) Local Government and Finance Act 1992 in two contiguous properties, being occupied together as one combined residence, when the properties remained on the valuation list as two hereditaments and were thus taxed as two chargeable dwellings rather than a single one.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had misdefined the issue by conflating the meaning of “dwelling” with “residence” and assuming that for the purposes of section 6 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 the two must always and necessarily be coterminous. Following Frost v Feltham [1981] 1 WLR 452, “sole or main residence” is a question of fact and degree and the correct approach is to weigh up the nature and extent of the relationship between the person concerned and each of the premises at issue (paragraphs 7, 14 and 15);
2.	section 131 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, as amended, states that the principal condition to qualify for council tax benefit is that the claimant is liable to pay council tax in respect of a dwelling of which he is a resident, the definitions of “dwelling” and “resident” for this purpose being those given in the Local Government Finance Act 1992 in connection with council tax liability. Therefore as the claimant was liable for council tax on both flats as a resident, he similarly qualified for council tax benefit on both as a resident (Stevens v East Hampshire DC and another [1994] RA 73 considered) (paragraphs 2, 9, 16 and 17).

The parents were divorced and there was a consent order in force requiring the father to pay maintenance for their children. That precluded the mother from making any application for child support maintenance under section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991. The mother claimed, and was awarded, income support, as a result of which the Secretary of State required her to be treated as having made an application for child support maintenance under section 6 of the Act. The Secretary of State decided that the father was liable for child support maintenance. The father appealed. In the meantime, the mother’s income support award had been terminated and she was convicted of having fraudulently claimed income support. The father’s grounds of appeal to the tribunal were, inter alia, that, as the mother had made a fraudulent claim for income support, section 6 of the 1991 Act should not have applied and the Secretary of State had no power to make the maintenance calculation. The tribunal dismissed the appeal, relying on Secretary of State for Social Security and another v Harmon, Carter and Cocks [1999] 1 WLR 163 (also reported as R(CS) 4/99) as authority for the proposition that it is the receipt of the benefit, not entitlement to it, which authorises the Secretary of State to make a maintenance calculation or assessment and citing CCS/3744/1998 as applying Harmon to cases where benefit was fraudulently claimed. The father appealed to the Commissioner.

1.	following R v South Ribble Borough Council ex parte Hamilton (2001) 33 HLR 9, legislation should not be construed so as to enable a person to profit from his own fraud, and the tribunal had erred in following CCS/3744/1998 in applying Harmon to a case where there was known fraud (paragraphs 17 and 18);
2.	in the light of the information which became available to him on the submission of the father’s appeal, the Secretary of State should have carried out a revision under section 16 of the 1991 Act and regulation 3A(1)(c) in conjunction with regulation 4 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 on the basis that he had no jurisdiction to make the maintenance calculation and the decision had been made in error (paragraphs 1 and 19);
3.	by regulation 8(1) of the Child Support (Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction) Regulations 1992 the consent order therefore was to be treated as having continued in force (paragraph 24);
4.	(obiter) that result did not necessarily leave the mother without remedy (paragraphs 23 and 24).

The claimant was receiving state pension credit and council tax benefit. The local authority issued to him a short review form asking for some basic information relevant to entitlement. The claimant did not complete the form and ignored a reminder, which warned that benefit might be suspended if he did not provide the information requested. The claimant did not reply and benefit was first suspended under regulation 13 of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 (the 2001 Regulations) and then terminated under regulation 14. The claimant appealed, but the appeal tribunal dismissed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that the local authority had not acted reasonably under the Verification Framework in requiring him to provide some of the information requested. Before the Commissioner the issue arose as to whether there was a right of appeal against a decision to terminate an award following suspension, since there was an apparent contradiction within the legislation. The issue was whether a termination decision was a “relevant decision” within the definition in paragraph 1(2) to Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, and therefore appealable, or an administrative decision outside the normal decision-revision-supersession rules and therefore not appealable.  Regulation 14 of the 2001 Regulations provides that a person shall “cease to be entitled” to benefit from the date of suspension, but paragraph 5(b) of the Schedule to the 2001 Regulations prescribes a decision that entitlement to benefit is terminated under regulation 14 as having a right of appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the cessation of entitlement under paragraph 15 and regulation 14 must take effect by a decision of the local authority as for it take effect simply by operation of law would make it unique within the structure of the legislation, and that view is supported by paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the 2001 Regulations, which assumes that a decision is required (paragraph 28);
2.	the decision–-revision–-supersession provisions are the only express decision-making provisions for council tax benefit once a claim has been decided and a termination decision fits within that framework as taking effect on supersession of the awarding decision on the basis of a change of circumstances under regulation 7(2)(a)(1) of the 2001 Regulations, whether that change of circumstances is the operation of regulation 14 or the facts underlying the operation of regulation 14 (paragraphs 30 to 31);
3.	although regulation 8 purports to fix the effective date for supersession decisions made under regulation 7(2)–(7) and makes no provision for termination decisions, it must be read as limited to matters authorised by paragraph 4(6) of Schedule 7, whereas the effective date for termination decisions is governed by regulation 14 (paragraph 32);
4.	 a termination decision is therefore a “relevant decision” and within the right of appeal under paragraph 6(1) (paragraph 33);
5.	the issue for the tribunal was whether the  local authority had acted in accordance with regulation 72 of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations 2006 in its request for information and not whether it had followed the guidelines in the Verification Framework (paragraph 36);
6.	the tribunal was right to accept jurisdiction and to decide the appeal as it did (paragraph 38).

The father, who was the non-resident parent, had shared care of his daughter and had substantial travel costs for purposes of that care. The Secretary of State made a maintenance calculation, including an adjustment for the shared care but refusing a variation to make provision for the travel costs as contact costs under regulation 10(1) of The Child Support (Variation) Regulations 2000, on the ground that the travel costs were excluded by regulation 10(4) of those regulations as costs “which relate to periods where the non-resident parent has care of a qualifying child overnight as part of a shared care arrangement”. The father appealed and an appeal tribunal allowed his appeal, holding that travel costs incurred on the way to or from the child arose outside the period of the shared care arrangement and were therefore not caught by regulation 10(4). The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
The words “which relate to” have a much broader meaning than “during” and if costs are incurred for the purposes of a period, then they “relate to” that period and are excluded from eligible contact costs by regulation 10(4) (paragraph 9).

The claimant was in receipt of incapacity benefit and had an income from student lodgers. Regulation 16 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 provides that a claimant should be treated as capable of work, and therefore not entitled to incapacity benefit, on each day of every week during which he does any work, subject to exemptions set out in regulation 17. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner against the decision of an appeal tribunal that her earnings from self-employment exceeded the limit for exempt work set out in regulation 17. The Commissioner calculated the claimant’s earnings on a week-by-week basis rather than averaged over a one-year (or shorter) period as would have been required by the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996. He held that the Computation Regulations did not govern the calculation of the claimant’s earnings. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the Computation Regulations applied, and referred the case back to the Commissioner for redetermination. The decision of the Court of Appeal is reported as R(IB) 1/06.
In issue before the Commissioner was the correct interpretation of regulations 12 and 13(2) and (4) of the Computation Regulations. Regulation 12(2) provides that a self-employed person’s “earnings” means gross receipts excluding disregards in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 1. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 provides for a fixed disregard in the calculation of income from boarders. Regulation 13(4) provides that the earnings to be taken into account are the net profit, after deducting the actual expenses, while regulation 13(2) provides that there shall be disregarded or deducted as appropriate from a claimant’s net profit any sum, where applicable, specified in Schedule 1. The Secretary of State argued that the disregard in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 was meant to cover the claimant’s outgoings and therefore it would be double counting to apply both regulation 13(2) and 13(4)(a).  
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there is nothing in the wording of paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to warrant the assumption that the disregard there specified is in respect of the claimant’s expenses (paragraph 14);
2.	there is nothing in the wording of paragraphs (2) and (4) of regulation 13 read by themselves to imply that the paragraph (4) defrayals and the Schedule 1 disregards are not both to be taken into account (paragraph 15);
3.	regulations 12, 13(1), (2) and (4) read with paragraph 3, as they are written, plainly provide that the income side of the claimant’s profit and loss calculation under regulation 13(4) does not include the Schedule 1 disregards and that the same disregards will be deducted from the net profit as calculated under 13(4) and although that effect may be anomalous, there was no scope for a purposive interpretation (paragraphs 16 to 18);
4.	in the claimant’s case the application of the paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 disregards to her gross receipts in terms of regulation 12(2) alone resulted in weekly earnings below the limit in regulation 17(2)(a) of the 1995 Regulations, and therefore she was not to be treated as capable of work (paragraphs 19 to 23).

Supersession – date of effect of supersession decision – transitional award of incapacity benefit – whether decision being superseded “incapacity benefit decision”
Recovery of overpayment – failure to disclose – requirement to notify Secretary of State of change of circumstances – statement by Secretary of State that claimant “should” disclose – whether amounted to requirement 
The claimant had been in receipt of invalidity benefit, which took effect as an award of incapacity benefit under the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (Transitional) Regulations 1995. In March 2002 he received a factsheet explaining the new rules for exempt work that a claimant would be permitted to do without loss of entitlement to incapacity benefit, following amendments to regulation 17 of the Incapacity for Work (General) Regulations 1995. The factsheet stated that he “should” tell the office dealing with his benefit before starting work. In September 2002 he started work that would comply with the new rules apart from the specific notice requirement in regulation 17(1)(a) that he inform the Secretary of State within 42 days of starting work. He continued working until April 2004 without informing the Secretary of State. In August 2004 the Secretary of State made a supersession decision to the effect that the claimant was not entitled to incapacity benefit for the period he was working, He appealed and the tribunal upheld both decisions. On the claimant’s further appeal, the Commissioner held that the statement in the factsheet that the claimant should disclose his having started work amounted to a requirement to disclose a change of circumstances within the meaning of regulation 32(1) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, and that there had therefore been a failure to disclose in breach of section 71(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The Commissioner followed B v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 929, reported at R(IS) 9/06, in disregarding the claimant’s mental state and memory difficulties. 
The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal it was argued that the tribunal had erred in failing to consider as a matter “raised by the appeal” whether the decision superseded by the Secretary of State was an “incapacity decision” as defined in regulation 7(2)(c) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, and so could be superseded only from the date that the claimant knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the change of circumstances should have been notified, Mongan v Department of Social Development [2005] NICA 16, reported as R 3/05 (DLA), being cited as authority that an  issue need not be explicitly raised by a party to be raised “by the appeal” under section 12(8) of the Social Security Act 1998, provided it is clearly apparent from the evidence. 
Held, dismissing the supersession appeal, but allowing the overpayment appeal, that:
1.	regulation 7(2)(c) did not apply, since CSIB/501/2003 and CSIB/695/2004 were correct in holding that transitional awards of incapacity benefit were not “incapacity decision” as defined in regulation 7(2)(c) of the 1999 Regulations and hence the issue was not “raised by the appeal” (Mongan approved as to the meaning of “raised by the appeal”) (paragraphs 24 to 43);
2.	the words in the factsheet were not the language of clear and unambiguous mandatory requirement, such as to makes it absolutely clear that the Secretary of State was imposing a requirement in accordance with regulation 32(1) and therefore the appellant had not failed to disclose in breach of section 71(1) of the Social Security Administration Act (CIB/3925/2003 and R(IB) 4/05 approved) (paragraphs 48 to 58).
Note: the notice requirement in regulation 17 of the Incapacity for Work (General) Regulations 1995 was abolished with effect from 10 April 2006 by SI 2006/757.

Reduced benefit direction – reasonable grounds for believing risk of harm or undue distress – whether objective or subjective test
The claimant was the parent with care. She made a claim for income support indicating that she did not wish the Secretary of State to pursue her son’s father for child maintenance. She stated that her former partner’s behaviour had become erratic and unpredictable and that she feared he might become violent. The Secretary of State decided that her reasons did not justify a decision not to reduce her benefit under section 46 of the Child Support Act 1991, as there were not reasonable grounds for believing that if he were to take action to recover child support maintenance there would be a risk of harm or undue distress to her and her son. She appealed to a child support appeal tribunal. In her appeal to the tribunal she added an account of a violent incident. She attended the tribunal hearing and gave evidence. The tribunal decided that her evidence was unreliable and dismissed her appeal. She appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed her appeal, accepting that there were credible explanations for the differences in the claimant’s evidence at different stages of the proceedings. The Commissioner held that, while the test of harm is objective, the test of undue distress is subjective, and suggested that the more irrational the fear, the greater the risk of undue distress. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal’s conclusion that some of what the claimant said was dishonest was permissible on the facts and inevitably then affected the approach to the rest of her evidence (paragraphs 32 to 35); 
2.	having rejecting the claimant’s evidence of a risk of violence, the tribunal rightly went on to consider whether there was evidence of a realistic prospect of harm or undue distress to herself or her son occurring in some other way and, since the only evidence was her unsupported assertion, it was entitled to reach the conclusions of fact that there was not (paragraphs 36 to 37);
3.	 in order to judge whether a particular claimant has shown reasonable grounds for believing that there would be a risk of undue distress to her or a child, an objective judgment must be made as to whether the foreseeable distress is unjustified or unreasonable in the context of the personal, subjective characteristics of the claimant or child, and while irrationality or paranoia are factors to be taken into account as providing the context against which the extent of the distress is to be assessed, they are not determinative (paragraph 45).

The claimant was awarded council tax benefit based on his income from self-employment and his wife’s part-time earnings. His business was making a loss during the relevant period and he disputed the income figure the local authority had used in the calculation, arguing that the loss from his self-employment should be deducted from his wife’s earnings. The tribunal upheld the council’s decision and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Regulation 22(10) of the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations 1992 prevents offsetting of losses from a claimant’s self-employed business against any other employment in which he is engaged. The claimant argued that regulation 22(10) did not apply because, although his wife’s earnings were required by section 136 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to be treated as his, section 136 did not require that he be treated as engaged in the employment undertaken by his wife and regulation 22(10) only applied where the claimant is engaged in two or more employments.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	although regulation 22(10) did not in terms prevent offsetting against his wife’s income, regulation 22(1) and (3) allowed only for net profit to be taken into account in calculating self-employed income and made no provision for a loss to be treated as anything other than nil (R(FC) 1/93 followed) (paragraphs 21 to 27);
2.	it followed that there was no figure to offset against the earnings of his wife (paragraph 28);
3.	while that interpretation might appear to render regulation 22(10) unnecessary, the fact that regulation 22(10) begins with the words “for the avoidance of doubt” confirms that the result would have been the same even if regulation 22(10) had not been enacted (paragraph 28).

The claimant suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis which resulted in symptoms of lethargy, arthralgia and nausea. She was refused disability living allowance although she had previously been in receipt of the lowest rate of the care component. On her appeal the tribunal again awarded her that component on the basis of her inability to prepare a cooked main meal, having satisfied itself that her nausea was an overwhelming problem. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, relying on the interpretation in CSDLA/854/2003 of Moyna v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] UKHL 44 (reported as R(DLA) 7/03) as authority for the proposition that experiencing nausea when cooking could not entitle a claimant to the lowest rate of the care component. In the alternative, the Secretary of State submitted that the case should be referred to a new tribunal for further findings on the question whether the nausea caused by actually preparing food could be alleviated by using the available ventilation in her kitchen.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	R(DLA) 1/97  and other authorities, holding that a person qualifies under the cooking test if, by reason of his disability, he cannot reasonably be expected to prepare a cooked main meal, were still good law (paragraph 6);
2.	in applying the “notional test” or “thought experiment” referred to by Lord Hoffmann in Moyna, the potential or actual effect on the claimant of cooking could not be left out of account. The claimant’s  nausea was a symptom of her disability and to have discounted it would have led to failure to calibrate the severity of her disability accurately (CDLA/1471/2004 preferred to CSDLA/854/2003) (paragraph 7);
3.	it was not sufficiently probable that the nausea could have been alleviated by ventilation to warrant remitting the matter to a new tribunal (paragraph 8).

The claimant was a Polish national. She entered the United Kingdom (UK) in February 2004 and worked as an au pair but was dismissed after she became pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter in August 2005. She was in receipt of income support from October 2005 until March 2006, when her entitlement was terminated following a decision that she did not have a right to reside in the UK. She appealed to an appeal tribunal, which allowed her appeal, holding that she had a right to reside in the UK under Directive 93/96/EEC (the Directive) and the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 (the 2000 Regulations) on the basis that she was the parent and primary carer of a child, who had a right to reside in the UK as the dependent child of the claimant’s former partner, who himself had a right to reside in the UK as a student from abroad pursuing a vocational training course in the UK. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, who set aside the tribunal’s decision, finding that the claimant had not shown that the father was a student at the material time or that the child was dependent on him. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	it is for the claimant to supply the information  needed to determine whether the conditions of entitlement have been met (Kerr v Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL 23 (also reported as R 1/04 (SF)) cited) and that was also true in determining whether the conditions of entitlement have ceased to be satisfied (paragraph 30);
2.	it was proper and reasonable for the Commissioner to proceed on the basis that the claimant’s legal representatives had supplied him with all the information relevant to questions that he had to decide and that the submissions made to him by counsel were based on the available information and were directed to the relevant provisions of the Directive and the 2000 Regulations (paragraph 31);
3.	on the evidence adduced the Commissioner was not wrong in rejecting the contention that the claimant’s child was dependent on her former partner, for which purpose material support must be shown, which, though not necessarily financial, must provide for, or contribute towards, the basic necessities of life (paragraphs 32 and 33);
4.	 the Commissioner had considered the proportionality of depriving the claimant’s child of her right to reside and had been entitled on the evidence to reach the conclusion that the child would require public financial support for sufficient time and in sufficient amount to be a burden on the social assistance system (paragraph 34);
5.	it was unnecessary for the Commissioner or the Court to consider whether, if her child had right to reside, the claimant would also have, as primary carer, an indirect right to reside for the purposes of claiming entitlement to income support (paragraph 36).

The claimant lived in residential accommodation from June 1999 to October 2002 and throughout that period her income support, except for a small personal expenses allowance, was paid directly to the providers of the accommodation. On 25 July 2002 the House of Lords decided in R v Manchester City Council ex parte Stennet [2002] UKHL 34, [2002] 2 AC 1127 that social services authorities were not entitled to charge for after-care provided under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The authority therefore refunded the claimant the care charges. The Secretary of State decided that that payment, which exceeded the capital limit for entitlement to income support, was to be taken into account as capital and therefore terminated the claimant’s award of benefit. The claimant appealed on the ground that the payment made to her by the authority should have been disregarded under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as “arrears of, or any concessionary payment made to compensate for arrears due to the non-payment of … an income-related benefit”. The appeal tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
Although income support had been wrongly paid to the care providers, possibly without valid express or statutory authority, the payment to the claimant was not in respect of income support, which can only be paid by the Secretary of State, but a payment made by the social services authority in respect of charges which had been wrongly imposed by the authority, and so could not be considered as arrears of income support (CIS/2448/2006 approved) (paragraph 18).

The non-resident parent appealed against a maintenance assessment based on earnings which included payments from his employers towards the cost of leasing a car used for his work. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that the car allowance was not paid in respect of an expense which was “wholly” and “exclusively” incurred for the performance of his duties as required by paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992, since the non-resident parent was not required to use the car exclusively for business purposes. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in construing the words “wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred” it was appropriate to follow the approach taken by the House of Lords in IRC v Richards’ Executors [1971] 1 WLR 571 and to construe the words so as to produce a reasonable result in the relevant statutory context (paragraph 7);
2.	in the context of the provisions of the 1992 Regulations governing the computation of the earnings of employed persons it could not have been intended that any personal use of a car by a non-resident parent should result in the whole of the amount paid by the employer in respect of the expenses of leasing the car being treated as available for the support of the relevant children and such an interpretation would produce the sort of discrimination between employed and self-employed persons which the Court of Appeal in Parsons v Hogg (reported as an appendix to R(FIS) 4/85) considered was unlikely to be intended by the legislation  (paragraph 8);
3.	the principles governing apportionment of expenses as a means of determining what part of a payment has been wholly and exclusively incurred for business purposes set out in R(FC) 1/91 were therefore to be applied to the earnings of employed persons in child support cases with the proviso that in those cases the expenses must also be “ necessarily” incurred, that is, it must be essential to incur the expense in order to perform the duties of the employment (Owen v Burden [1972] All ER 356 cited) (paragraph 9);
4.	while it was correct that any payments by the employer relating to capital expenditure by the non-resident parent fell outside paragraph 1(2)(a) of Schedule 1 and must therefore be treated as earnings, none of the car leasing costs in this case were of a capital nature (Atherton v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited [1926] AC 205 followed) (paragraphs 10 and 11);
5.	since the proportion of monthly car leasing costs attributable to the business use of the car exceeded the employers’ car allowance, the whole of that allowance should be considered as a payment in respect of expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the non-resident parent’s employment (paragraph 13).

",,"European Union law – free movement – whether a former worker has a right of residence under Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty 
Residence and presence conditions – right to reside – scope of Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty
The claimant was a Polish national, who came to the United Kingdom in April 2002. She was initially a student and then in employment, but became economically inactive after the birth of her child and claimed income support in October 2005. Her application was rejected but she appealed successfully to an appeal tribunal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed the appeal. The claimant appealed to the Court. It was common ground that under domestic legislation she was not entitled as she did not enjoy the right to reside in the UK at the material time because she was not a “qualified person” as defined by regulation 5 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000. The argument for the claimant was that entitlement arose under the EU Treaty: either Article 12 on the authority of Trojani v Centre public d’aide sociale de Bruxelles (Case C-456/02) [2004] ECR I-7573, where it was held that a citizen of the Union who is not economically active may rely on Article 12 EC where he has been lawfully resident in the host Member State for a certain time or possesses a residence permit, or Article 18 on the authority of Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Case C-413/99) [2002] ECR 1-7091 on the basis that it was disproportionate to deny a right of residence, and thereby entitlement to income support, to a person who was lawfully resident and as substantially settled as the claimant.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the reference to lawful residence “for a certain time” in Trojani is a reference to specific qualifying periods which give rise to an express right of residence and does not open the door to eligibility based on residence of unspecified but significant duration and of a type which evidences a degree of social integration in the host Member State (paragraph 16);
2.	Article 18(1) may be relied upon to fill a lacuna in a Directive where it would be disproportionate for the limitations and conditions contained in the Directive and the domestic Regulations to undermine the direct application of Article 18, but the facts of Baumbast were more susceptible to such lacuna-filling than the facts of the present case where, at the material time, the appellant was no longer a worker and nor was she self-sufficient (paragraphs 17 to 22);
3.	an authoritative insight into the parameters of proportionality is given by Council Directive 2004/38/EC, in force from 30 April 2006, which provides for a right of permanent residence after five years’ lawful presence that is not conditional on the claimant being economically active or self-sufficient, and, if a five year qualification is proportionate in that context, it is all the more difficult to argue that it would be disproportionate to exclude this appellant from income support when, at the time of her claim, she had been in this country for three years and had become economically inactive (paragraph 23).

The two claimants, who had learning difficulties, shared a house of which the landlord was Golden Lane Housing Limited (GLH). Until April 2003 a Trust (OLD) acted on behalf of GLH in managing the property and providing housing-related support. The two claimants were in receipt of housing benefit and the charges in respect of housing-related support were included by the local authority in the eligible rent. Following amendments in force from April 2003, those charges were paid to OLD directly by the Supporting People Administering Authority, but OLD continued to provide management services on behalf of GLH. The local authority then restricted the eligible rent to the local reference rent, applying the version of regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 which had been in force since 2 January 1996. The claimants argued on appeal that their accommodation was exempt by virtue of the saving provision in regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1995. Regulation 10(6), as amended in 1999, defines exempt accommodation as including accommodation provided by certain bodies where the landlord or a person acting on its behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. It was argued on behalf of the claimants that that provision applied where the person providing support acted on behalf of the landlord in any respect, not necessarily in providing support. In the alternative it was argued that GLH itself provided support. The tribunal dismissed the appeal and the claimants appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal in an interim decision, that:
1.	the natural meaning of regulation 10(6) was that the care, support and supervision should be provided either by or on behalf of the landlord and had the meaning contended for been intended, the draftsman would have used much clearer wording (paragraphs 27 to 28);
2.	the unamended definition made it clear that the care, support and supervision should be provided either by or on behalf of the landlord, and there was no plausible reason for changing the definition (paragraph 29);
3.	the definition of “supported accommodation” in Schedule 1 to the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, as amended in 1999, was clearly worded so as to cover only cases where the support provider was acting on behalf of the landlord in providing support and there was a strong inference that the amended definition of “exempt accommodation” was intended to have the same meaning (paragraphs 30 to 31); 
4.	therefore the tribunal had been correct in construing regulation 10(6) as limiting the saving provision to cases where the support provider was acting on behalf of the landlord in providing support (paragraphs 26 and 33);
5.	however, it was not clear from the tribunal’s statement of reasons that it had addressed the correct wording of regulation 10(6) in considering whether GLH itself provided support and therefore its decision should be set aside (paragraphs 34 to 37).
The Commissioner gave directions for the final determination of the cases by him together with two other cases relating to GLH properties.

Following an accident during service in the Royal Air Force, the claimant had been involved in incidents of self-harm and had needed psychiatric care. The Secretary of State awarded war disablement pension, having accepted depressive illness and post-traumatic stress disorder as attributable to service. The claimant made a claim in respect of two further conditions, resulting from self-inflicted injuries to his right little finger and to his toe, which he claimed resulted from the psychiatric condition attributable to service. The injury to his toe was accepted as attributable to service, but the claim in respect of “Laceration of the Right Hand with Tendon Damage” was rejected. The claimant appealed. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding the accounts of the injury to the finger inconsistent and unsupported by medical evidence and any connection to service too remote. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	where service conditions have played a part in producing “the complex of circumstances” leading to a self-inflicted but non-fatal injury, the resulting disablement is attributable to service, applying the test set out in Freeman v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance [1966] 1 WLR 456 relating to fatal self-injury (paragraphs 7 and 8);
2.	the claimant’s account of the incident causing the injury to his finger was not inherently unlikely or implausible and was enough to raise a reasonable doubt in the appellant’s favour and therefore, applying the test in R v Department of Social Security ex parte Edwards (CO/2281/1990), that evidence was “reliable” (paragraphs 9 and 10);
3.	in holding that the appellant’s claim lay outside the scope of the war pensions scheme the tribunal’s decision was erroneous in point of law and the condition “Laceration of the Right Hand with Tendon damage was attributable to service (paragraphs 1 and 8).

Residence and presence conditions – right to reside – scope of Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty
The claimant was a Cameroon national. While seeking asylum, he married a French national. She was working in the United Kingdom and therefore, as a “qualified person” as defined by regulation 5 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000, had a right to reside in the United Kingdom. By his marriage he acquired a right of residence as a member of her family. He then became seriously ill and his wife gave up work to look after him.  His claim for income support was rejected on the ground that he lost his right of residence when his wife gave up work. He appealed and a tribunal allowed his appeal on the ground that his wife had not lost her status of “worker” because she was involuntarily unemployed while looking after him and therefore remained a “qualified person”. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 5(2)(a) of the 2000 Regulations, under which a person may remain a “qualified person” while temporarily incapable of work, contemplated the person who claimed to be a worker being ill rather than someone else being ill and therefore the claimant’s wife did not remain a qualified person by virtue of regulation 5(2)(a) while she was looking after the claimant (paragraph 11);
2.	the term “involuntarily unemployed” in regulation 5(2)(b) of the 2000 Regulations must be regarded as focussing on the question whether the claimant is still in the labour market rather than on the circumstances in which he or she ceased to be employed and, in the present case, the claimant’s wife had withdrawn from the labour market and thus was not involuntarily unemployed (paragraphs 12 and 13);
3.	Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty can confer a right of residence in addition to those conferred by directives made for the purpose of giving effect to rights arising in respect of freedom of movement (Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home Department (case C-413/99) [2002] ECR I-7091 followed) but, where it is clear that the extent of a right of residence conferred by a directive has deliberately been drawn with a view to ensuring that a class of persons does not have a right of residence, a national court is not entitled to undermine the directive by finding that that class of person has a right of residence by virtue of Article 18(1), because Article 18(1) is made subject to directives by the very terms of the Treaty and such a finding would amount to a finding that the directive was ultra vires (paragraphs 23 to 27);
4.	however, a person may be found to have a right of residence by virtue of Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty where the principle of proportionality requires that a lacuna in directives must be filled, proportionality must be judged by reference to, inter alia, Directive 2004/38/EC in any case arising after the adoption of that directive and there may, in principle, be circumstances in which the principle of proportionality requires that a right of residence be recognised even though the claimant is not self-sufficient (paragraph 37);
5.	where a worker exercising rights under Article 39 of the Treaty in the United Kingdom is obliged to cease work and cannot be available for alternative work due to a need to care for his or her spouse who is a not a citizen of the Union but who is temporarily seriously disabled, they both retain rights of residence in the United Kingdom in the circumstances that arose in this case (paragraph 54).

The non-resident parent was the sole director and majority shareholder in a company. He made a loan to the company and arranged for the company to pay him back at a rate of £2,500 per month. The maintenance assessment did not include those repayments as income and the parent with care appealed. The tribunal held that the payments should be treated as income. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner, who held that the payments fell within paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (the MASC Regulations) as “any other payments or other amounts received on a periodical basis …”. The non-resident parent appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Child Support Act 1991 and Regulations draw a clear demarcation between capital and income and a periodical drawdown of capital is not “income” (Morrell v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ 526 (reported as R(IS) 6/03), R v West Dorset DC ex parte Poupard (1988) 20 HLR 295 and Longsdon v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance [1956] 1 QB 587  distinguished) (paragraph 33); 
2.	paragraph 15 is a “sweep-up” provision for other kinds of income not specifically dealt with in other provisions and in that context cannot be read as including a periodical drawdown of capital. If Parliament had wanted to include periodic drawdown of capital it could have expressly so provided (paragraph 33);
3.	the contrary interpretation would lead to irrational distinctions that could not have been intended by a reasonable legislator, as lump sum repayments or irregular repayments of varying amounts would not be caught by paragraph 15 (paragraph 38).
The Court remitted the case for a fresh determination to consider whether any of the anti-avoidance provisions in the MASC Regulations applied.

They subsequently made income support claims, which were both refused under regulation 70(3A) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (as inserted by regulation 8 of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996) because they had not claimed asylum “on [their] arrival” in the UK. Successive appeals were rejected by an appeal tribunal, by a Commissioner and by the Court of Appeal. On the claimants’ further appeal, the Secretary of State, having regard to the provisions of section 11(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, contended that the phrase “on his arrival” implicitly required that the asylum claim be made to an immigration officer at the port of entry. The claimants submitted that the phrase was imprecise and admitted of some flexibility and that they had claimed asylum at the earliest opportunity.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 70(3A) does not, despite the recommendation of the Social Security Advisory Committee, provide a comprehensive definition of the meaning of “on his arrival”. Section 11 of the Immigration Act 1971 does not resolve the ambiguity, as it is concerned with “entry”, not “arrival” (paragraphs 34 to 37);
2.	the claimants could not reasonably have been expected to claim asylum any earlier than they did, having regard both to their practical opportunity for doing so and their state of mind, including any effect of what the agents who arranged their entry may have said (R(Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 364 preferred to Shire v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ 1465). Regulation 70(3A) was therefore satisfied (paragraphs 38 to 40).

The non-resident parent applied for a supersession of a departure direction on the ground that the amounts which had been allowed under that direction for his travel to work costs no longer reflected his actual costs, which had increased. The supersession application was made on the basis of (a) petrol costs between his home and his work, (b) parking costs in the town where he worked, (c) travel by car to meet clients and (d) travel by train to London. All four categories of expenses had been added by way of the original departure direction to his exempt income and protected income under the main formula assessment and the resulting decision on the supersession increased the amounts to be added. The parent with care appealed and the tribunal allowed the appeal to the extent of holding that only his petrol costs and not his other travel costs could be added to his exempt income and protected income by way of departure direction. It found that car parking was not “a minor incidental cost” and was not “incurred in connection with … travel” as it only arises after the journey is completed and therefore was not an allowable expense under regulation 13 of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendment Regulations 1996. The non-resident parent appealed to the Commissioner contending that the tribunal should have held that all four categories of expenditure had been properly added.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 13 makes clear that only costs incurred for the purpose of travel between the applicant’s home and his “normal place of work” can be included in a departure direction. The tribunal was therefore correct to hold that neither categories (c) or (d) of the travel expenses could be the subject of a departure direction (paragraph 12);
2.	the car parking charges, being a similar amount to the tolls and fees specifically mentioned in regulation 13, were not outside the regulation on the ground of being “minor” (paragraph 13);
3.	as a matter of the ordinary meaning of regulation 13 the parking charges were incurred “in connection with such travel” (ie travel between home and work) and were also incurred “for the purpose of ” such travel. The cost therefore did fall within regulation 13 (paragraphs 14).
The Commissioner directed that the decision should not be implemented until the Secretary of State had considered whether the calculation of the non-resident parent’s net income under the main formula assessment required to be revised or superseded, directing that any of the parties might apply to him in the event of any dispute arising out of the implementation of the decision.

The claimant was refused housing benefit and council tax benefit on the ground that he had capital of £30,000 in the form of a caravan on a non-residential site. The local authority ruled that it could not be disregarded as a personal possession because it was static and connected to services and therefore was to be classed as property. He appealed to a tribunal, arguing that the value of the caravan should be disregarded as a personal possession under regulation 38(2) of, and paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to, the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (consolidated in the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 as regulation 44 and paragraph 12 of Schedule 6). The tribunal found that the caravan was capital, but its conclusions on the issue whether it should be disregarded as a personal possession were unclear. The question whether the claimant had acquired the caravan with the intention of reducing his capital in order to secure entitlement to housing benefit or to increase the amount of that benefit was not in issue. The tribunal dismissed the appeal and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner, who invited the Secretary of State to join the proceedings as a party. The Secretary of State’s representative supported the appeal on the basis of CPC/370/2006.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law in failing to deal adequately with the issue of whether the caravan was a personal possession and therefore to be disregarded under paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 (paragraphs 21 and 22);
2.	the caravan was capital for the purposes of the housing benefit and council tax legislation (paragraphs 23 to 28) but fell to be disregarded as a “personal possession”. Having regard to the context of the words and the history of the legislation, “personal possessions” mean any physical assets other than land and assets used for business purposes (broadly the same conclusion as was reached in CPC/370/2006) (paragraphs 53 to 55).

The claimant was a Polish national who came to the United Kingdom as an asylum-seeker in 1998 and was granted temporary admission. He was severely disabled and not economically self-sufficient. His claim for asylum was rejected but he made a human rights claim that had not been determined at the time of the appeal to the Commissioner.  In 2004 Poland acceded to the European Union. The claimant claimed income support in 2006. The Secretary of State disallowed the claim on the ground that the claimant had no right of residence and therefore could not be treated as habitually resident in the United Kingdom with the result that he was a “person from abroad” with an applicable amount of nil by virtue of regulation 21 of, and paragraph 17 of Schedule 7 to, the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as amended. The claimant appealed and the tribunal found that he had a permanent right of residence under Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC because he had “resided legally for a continuous period of five years” in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	under domestic law, temporary admission granted to an asylum-seeker is not a right to reside, as the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 make a clear distinction between a right of admission and presence and a right of residence (paragraph 15);
2.	whether or not GN (EEA Regulations: Five years’ residence) Hungary [2007] UKAIT 00073 is good authority for the proposition that rights of residence held under domestic law before a person becomes a citizen of the Union are not relevant for the purposes of Article 16(1), it was clear that the claimant had not at any time “resided legally” within the terms of Article 16(1) since he had neither exercised any Community right of residence in the United Kingdom nor had a right of residence under United Kingdom domestic law (paragraph 26).

In a subsequent Annual Declaration, required under section 17 of the Tax Credits Act 2002, made in September 2005, the couple declared the wife’s income for 2004/05 as nil. In September 2006, pursuant to section 19(3) of the Act, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued decisions on their entitlement to WTC for 2004/05 based on their joint income for the whole tax year, reducing their entitlement by £750. The claimant appealed, arguing that income earned by his wife before they became a couple was irrelevant to their WTC entitlement after becoming a couple. The tribunal confirmed HMRC’s decision and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner submitting that the tribunal had failed to use its discretion. HMRC submitted, relying on sections 3 and 7 of the Act, that the tribunal’s decision was correct in law.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal was correct in law. The position where a claim period is less than a whole tax year is governed by regulation 7 of the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and Determination of Rates) Regulations 2002, which provides that the income for the relevant period is a fraction of the income for the whole tax year, the fraction being the number of days in the claim period divided by the number of days in the tax year. The same fraction is then applied to the income threshold and other elements in the calculation (paragraphs 15 and 16);
2.	the wording was unambiguous and even if it created an anomalous outcome in a case where it attributed a portion of income to a claim period in which no income was in fact earned, the outcome was not so absurd that Parliament could not have intended it (paragraphs 18 to 20).

Her father became a naturalised British Citizen in July 2004. In August 2004 she claimed income support which was disallowed on the ground that she did not have a right to reside in the United Kingdom and therefore could not be treated as habitually resident here (regulation 21 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as then in force). She appealed saying that she had to care for her father. The tribunal dismissed her appeal.  A Commissioner granted leave to appeal because, while it appeared that the claimant had no right of residence as her father’s carer under European Community law or under the Agreement on the European Economic Area 1992 in the light of Abdirahman v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2007] EWCA Civ 657 (reported as R(IS) 8/07), the tribunal had not investigated whether she had a right of residence as a dependant of her father. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	The father’s right of residence was by virtue of domestic law only and, there being no evidence before the Commissioner that he had any right of residence under European Community law or under the Agreement on the European Economic Area 1992, the claimant had no right of residence as a dependant under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 and the tribunal’s failure to investigate the father’s position had therefore made no difference to the outcome of the appeal (paragraph 3);

The claimant applied for an award of disability living allowance (DLA). The tribunal, drawing support from the examining medical practitioner, found that the claimant was capable of walking out of doors even on unfamiliar routes. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that the tribunal had failed to disregard his ability on familiar routes.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the starting point was to consider whether the claimant could walk on familiar routes without assistance, before moving to look at ability on unfamiliar ones (CSDLA/12/2003 applied). It followed logically from the fact that a person was unable to walk on familiar routes without guidance or supervision, that the person would also be unable to do so on unfamiliar ones.  However, the converse did not apply.  It would depend on the nature of the person’s condition (paragraph 12);
2.	it was not necessary for the tribunal formally to apply the two stage process, provided that the relevant issues are addressed in substance (paragraph 13);
3.	in consideration of the legal criteria for entitlement to lower mobility, there must be ignored any ability to use familiar routes, albeit not an inability.  However, when considering whether the claimant is unable to walk on unfamiliar routes without guidance or supervision, it may be evidentially relevant to that question as a matter of fact, what, if any, are his difficulties with familiar routes (paragraph 14);
4.	the statutory test for the lower rate of mobility component must be read as a whole. The disregard of any ability he may have to use routes “which are familiar to him on his own” prohibits a legal barrier to entitlement because of such an ability, but does not prevent consideration of it as an evidential tool when determining the person’s ability on unfamiliar routes (paragraph 16).

Industrial accident – cardiac arrest at work caused by stress – whether necessary to show that injury resulted from a separate external event
The claimant suffered a cardiac arrest at work following a period of sustained pressure at work. The Secretary of State refused to make a declaration of industrial accident on the ground that it had not been established that there was either an event which in itself was identifiable as an accident or a particular occasion on which personal injury was suffered by the claimant which would constitute an accident. The claimant’s appeal to an appeal tribunal was dismissed and he appealed to a Social Security Commissioner. The Commissioner accepted that Chief Adjudication Officer v Faulds [2000] 1 WLR 1035, also reported as R(I) 1/00, had established that “accident” and “injury” must be treated as conceptually distinct, so that “injury caused by accident” could not be treated as meaning the same as “accidental injury”. However, referring in particular to Fenton v J Thorley and Co Ltd [1903] AC 443 and Clover, Clayton & Co Ltd v Hughes [1910] AC 242 decided under the Workmen’s Compensation Acts, he held that, if a claimant suffered an injury which was of an expected type, it was necessary for him to show there was an “accident” which caused or contributed to the injury whereas, if the injury was of an unexpected type, there was nothing in Faulds which required him to show in addition that his injury was caused by some identifiable and exceptional event. The injury suffered by the claimant constituted an unlooked-for mishap or untoward event and, provided that the claimant’s cardiac arrest had the necessary causal connection with his work, it was properly to be regarded as an accident, even though it occurred in the normal course of the claimant’s duties and was not preceded by any abnormal event. The Commissioner further found that the pressure at work had probably contributed to the claimant’s cardiac arrest and he therefore found that he had suffered an industrial accident. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, allowing the appeal and restoring the appeal tribunal’s decision, that:
1.	the statements of principle in Faulds, maintaining the distinction between “accident” and “injury”, were inconsistent with the assertion that an unexpected cardiac arrest was itself an “accident” within the meaning of section 94(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (paragraphs 20, 27 and 28);
2.	(per Etherton and Aikens LJJ) although earlier authorities might appear to support the proposition of the Commissioner that the “time-honoured” definition of “accident” for the purposes of the Workmen’s Compensation Acts was “an unlooked-for mishap or an untoward event which is neither expected or designed”, there was, even before Faulds, a clear line of House of Lords’ authority from Fife Coal Co Ltd v Young [1940] AC 479 onwards in which judges had insisted on the distinction between the “accident”, which must be external, and the resulting “injury” to the claimant, whether the type of personal injury suffered by the claimant was of an expected type or an unexpected type, and therefore the Commissioner had erred and the question he ought to have asked, in the light of those cases and Faulds, was whether an external event or series of events (allied or not to some action by the claimant) had some physiological or psychological effect on the claimant and in this case there was no evidence that any external event had caused the cardiac arrest (paragraphs 27, 40, 49, 53 and 54);
3.	(obiter) the Commissioner’s finding that the cardiac arrest had been caused by exceptional pressures at work might have been sustainable but counsel for the claimant was wrong to suggest that it was required by the application of section 94(3) of the 1992 Act, which deems an accident in the course of employment to arise out of that employment in the absence of evidence to the contrary, since there was evidence capable of being evidence to the contrary (R v National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Commissioner, ex parte Richardson [1958] 1 WLR 851, also reported as a note to R(I) 21/58, applied) (paragraphs 23 to 25, 27 and 55).

",,"Maintenance assessment – effective date of formula assessment made after interim assessment
In September 1994 the mother applied for a child support maintenance assessment. In January 1995 the Child Support Agency on behalf of the Secretary of State sent the father a maintenance enquiry form, which he failed to return. The agency made an interim maintenance assessment, which was increased from 31 July 1995 by the imposition of a penalty for non-cooperation. In January 2000 a liability order was obtained against the father. The father returned the maintenance enquiry form to the agency in February 2000. In May 2005, the agency replaced the interim maintenance assessment with a full maintenance assessment at a lower rate with effect from 31 July 1995. The mother appealed and a tribunal allowed her appeal and ordered the Secretary of State to revert to the interim maintenance assessment for the period up to the receipt of the maintenance enquiry form, on the basis that regulation 8D(5) of the 1992 Regulations provided that an interim maintenance assessment could only be cancelled from the date the decision-maker received sufficient information to enable him to do so. The father appealed to the Commissioner, who upheld the decision of the tribunal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	on the correct construction of regulations 8D and 30A of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment Procedure) Regulations 1992, taken with regulation 17(3), if the Secretary of State has sufficient information to make a full maintenance assessment covering the entire period of an interim maintenance assessment from the first effective date, the Secretary of State is obliged to revise the assessment and to convert the interim maintenance assessment to a full maintenance assessment for the entire period. However, if the Secretary of State does not have sufficient information for the entire period, the interim maintenance assessment remains in force for the period up to the date when the information is provided but can be superseded from that date (CCS/2398/2006 approved) (paragraphs 21 to 29);
2.	the obligation to revise exists notwithstanding the existence or enforcement of a liability order in respect of the interim maintenance assessment (Farley v Child Support Agency [2006] UKHL 31, [2006] 1 WLR 1817 cited) (paragraphs 30 to 35);
3.	the appeal tribunal had erred in law in making an adverse finding of credibility against the father and it was open to the Secretary of State to make the full assessment on the basis of the evidence he had provided, including that which was undocumented (paragraphs 36 to 45).

The claimants were a married couple, who had lived in Australia. When they reached pensionable age, they were living in the United Kingdom (UK). Both were credited with deemed contributions under a reciprocal agreement between Australia and the UK and both were awarded a higher rate UK retirement pension. When the reciprocal agreement with Australia was terminated in 2001, those pensions continued in payment by virtue of the Social Security (Australia) Order 2000 (the 2000 Order). In 2004 the claimants moved to Paris and ceased to reside permanently in the UK. Four months later the Secretary of State reduced their retirement pensions to 35 per cent of the standard rate. The claimants appealed, but the tribunal dismissed their appeal. They appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed their appeal. Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 provides that old age benefits acquired under the legislation of one or more Member States shall not be subject to any reduction by reason of the fact that the recipient resides in the territory of a Member State other than that in which the institution responsible for payment is situated. However, paragraph 7 of Section Y of Annex VI to the 1971 Regulation provides that the Regulation does not apply to those provisions of UK legislation which are intended to bring into force any social security agreement concluded between the UK and a third State. The Commissioner held that the 2000 Order was not “intended to bring into force” a social security agreement, since the relevant agreement was terminated when the Order came into force. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary of State argued that the provisions of the 1971 Regulation did not apply to this case; that UK domestic law giving effect to an international social security agreement with Australia applied; and that under UK domestic law the right to the higher rate retirement pension ceased when the claimants ceased to live permanently in the UK.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	although the Australian Agreement was terminated as from 2001, the 2000 Order did bring certain provisions into effect for a limited purpose, namely that of preserving and continuing, in accordance with its terms, the retirement pension rights of existing recipients, and to that limited extent the 2000 Order satisfied the description of UK legislation in paragraph 7 (paragraphs 31 to 34);
2.	the 1971 Regulation only applied to conventions concluded between at least two Member States and one or more non-Member States and it was intended to exclude from its field of application conventions concluded between a single Member State and a third non-Member state. Such a convention was not therefore legislation within the meaning of the Articles in the Regulation on which the claimants had to rely (Case C-23/92 Grana-Novoa v Landesversicherungsanstalt Hessen [1993] ECR I-4505 followed) (paragraphs 36 to 41);
3.	(per Arden LJ) paragraph 7 should be interpreted purposively so as to cover legislation which continues in force, as well as brings into force, a social security agreement concluded between the UK and a third state, since both types of legislation give effect to social security agreements of that description and there is no difference for this purpose between legislation which brings into force, and legislation which continues in force, such an agreement (paragraph 44).

The non-resident parent appealed against the maintenance assessment on various grounds. Although the point was not argued before it, the tribunal found that occasions when the non-resident parent had looked after the children overnight at the parent with care’s home counted as looking after them for shared care purposes, and as a result directed that he was entitled to the one-seventh reduction provided by paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support Act 1991. The parent with care appealed to the Commissioner on the grounds that that view was wrong and also that the tribunal should simply have decided as between the opposing arguments put forward by the parties. Regulation 7 of the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 requires that for a night to count for shared care purposes the non-resident parent looks after the child and the child stays at the same address as the non-resident parent.
 Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	a non-resident parent looking after the children at the home of the parent with care is clearly “looking after” the children within the ordinary meaning of those words, whether or not he incurs any additional costs in doing so (R(CS) 11/02 followed) (paragraphs 18 and 19);
2.	if a non-resident parent looks after the children overnight at the parent with care’s home, the wording of regulation 7(1)(b) is, literally, satisfied in that the children are staying at the same address as the non-resident parent, and such an interpretation is not contrary to the context and purpose of the definition (paragraphs 21 to 23);
3.	the tribunal therefore reached the right conclusion, and the fact that it reached it on a basis for which the non-resident parent had not contended did not render it any less right (paragraph 24).

The claimant was awarded state retirement pension including 10p per week graduated retirement benefit (GRB) on the basis of 1 unit of contributions under the pre-1975 GRB scheme. The claimant asserted she had paid more than this and produced her own records to the Pension Service. The Pension Service confirmed the amount and she appealed. The tribunal dismissed the appeal on the basis that decisions about what types of contribution had been paid and how many had been paid were reserved to officers of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and could not be considered by the Secretary of State or social security appeal tribunal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.  Before the Commissioner the claimant alleged errors and omissions in the contribution record, and asked the Commissioner to decide on that basis that the record was unreliable. It was common ground before the Commissioner that the formal responsibility for all official record-keeping and decision-making about graduated retirement contributions, credits and benefits rested with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, though much of the practical record-keeping and decision-making was carried out by HMRC.
Held, allowing the appeal but confirming the Secretary of State’s decision, that:
1.	any decision about GRB must be a decision of the Secretary of State even if taken by HMRC as its agent and all decisions about entitlement to GRB are subject to appeal to the social security tribunals (paragraphs 25 to 28);
2.	when considering a disputed contribution record no adverse inference is to be drawn from the routine destruction of forms on which the individual records were based (Rose v HMRC [2006] UKSPC SPC00574, also reported at [2007] STC (SCD) 129 cited) and a single inaccurate or missing record does not compromise the reliability of the other records (paragraphs 31 to 35);
3.	a tribunal must be provided with copies of all the actual relevant records, not just assertions of their contents, and must be aware of the record-keeping procedures when evaluating what the individual records show in evidence (paragraph 35);
4.	there cannot be an appeal against the records themselves, if accurate; any challenge as to whether contributions were correctly paid should have been made at the time they were paid and recorded (paragraphs 35 and 38);
5.	although the tribunal had erred in law in deciding that it had no jurisdiction, on the facts of the present case the records showed that some contributions had been paid in error and then refunded; on that basis the amount of GRB awarded was correct, although the Pension Service’s initial responses to the claimant’s queries had been inaccurate and misleading (paragraphs 42 to 56).

The claimant was discharged from the Army for misconduct on 26 May 1974. On 17 October 1994 he was awarded a war disablement pension based on an interim assessment of 30 per cent for manic depressive psychosis aggravated by his service. The award was made effective from 20 November 1991, the date when he had first indicated he wished to claim. On 20 February 1995 the assessment was increased to 50 per cent with effect from 4 November 1994. On 13 June 1996 the Royal British Legion requested backdating of the award to the date of discharge, but there was no evidence of a decision on backdating until 12 September 2002, when the Secretary of State made a decision that payment on the assessment of 50 per cent could not be made for any period before 4 November 1994. The claimant appealed against that decision. The tribunal dismissed the appeal on the ground that the claimant did not fall within the scope of either paragraph 5 or paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, as amended, which governed the commencement date of awards. As originally enacted, Schedule 3 gave the Secretary of State a broad discretion to backdate an award.  A new version was substituted in 1997 (and further amended in 2001) which, so far as relevant, allowed backdating only if the delay was due to a medical condition or (on a review request) an error or omission on the part of the Secretary of State. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal but substituting his own decision to the same effect, that:
1.	it had been necessary to consider the nature of the 2002 decision under appeal to the tribunal (paragraphs 23 and 24);
2.	the 2002 decision was a review decision under article 67(2)(a) of the Service Pensions Order reviewing (but not revising) the awards made on 17 October 1994 and 20 February 1995 on the grounds of ignorance of material fact and, on the balance of probabilities, was a decision on the request for a review made in 1996 (paragraphs 25 to 29);
3.	a claimant applying for a review of the commencement date of an award needed to show good grounds for the delay in making the application for the review as well as for the delay in making the claim (paragraphs 30 and 31);
4.	under the new, non-discretionary version of Schedule 3, a failure by the Secretary of State to investigate whether backdating might be appropriate coupled with a failure to provide the claimant with sufficiently detailed information to enable him to realise he must raise it himself with appropriate evidence before the award was given amounted to an error or omission falling within paragraph 10 from 1997 and also paragraph 1(6A) from 2001, giving grounds for backdating an award made on a first application for review made with reasonable promptness (paragraphs 32 and 33);
5.	the tribunal had erred in not determining whether the decision under appeal was a review decision or whether there had been a previous review decision and in not considering the law as it was in force in 1991 when considering whether the award should have taken effect before the date of claim (paragraph 36);  
6.	the claimant may have had good grounds for delay in applying for the review, but he had not shown good grounds for delay in his original claim, since his medical condition had been variable and there were periods up to the date of claim when he could reasonably have been expected to claim (paragraphs 37 to 41);
7.	the tribunal had also erred in not considering whether an award based on an assessment of 50 per cent should have been made before 4 November 1994, but there had been no relevant grounds for review of the award of 17 October 1994 (paragraph 42).

The claimant had legal parental responsibility for two children under a shared residence order under the Children Act 1989, together with her former partner, who was the biological mother. Her former partner was in receipt of child benefit in respect of the children. The claimant claimed child benefit and an officer of Revenue and Customs (HMRC) refused benefit for the periods when the children were not living with her on the ground that she was not a “parent” of the children for the purposes of the order of priority in Schedule 10 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The claimant appealed and the tribunal dismissed her appeal, holding that the meaning of “parent” in this context had to be restricted to that of a biological parent. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	for the purposes of Schedule 10 “parent” in relation to a child or children means their legal parent, which is not restricted to a natural or biological parent (Secretary of State for Social Services v Smith [1983] 1 WLR 1110  followed) (paragraph 13);
2.	since a residence order under the Children Act confers legal parental responsibility, defined by section 3(1) as “all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property”, the claimant and her former partner were both entitled to equal priority as parents and, in default of any joint election by the two of them, entitlement to child benefit must be determined by HMRC in its discretion (paragraph 14).
The Commissioner remitted the case to HMRC for the question of entitlement for the outstanding periods to be determined.

The mother applied for child support maintenance in 2000. The father alleged that he had not received any maintenance enquiry forms and the application was still pending in 2002 when the Child Support Agency (CSA) were informed that the qualifying child had gone to live with her father. The CSA then closed the case. The child subsequently moved back to live with her mother, the actual period of absence being disputed, but in 2004 returned to live permanently with her father. In 2006 the CSA made maintenance assessments for periods between 2000 and 2004. The father appealed against those assessments and the appeal tribunal allowed his appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State had no power to make retrospective assessments, since there had been no assessment on the application made in 2000, and there was no evidence that the father had been notified of that application. The mother appealed to the Commissioner. Paragraph 16(4) Schedule 1 to the Child Support Act 1991 gives the Secretary of State the power to cancel an assessment that has been made if the person with care in relation to that assessment ceases to be a person with care. The main issue before the Commissioner was whether that provision meant that the mother had to make a new claim when the child returned to live with her.

1.	the Secretary of State remained under a duty to make a decision on the outstanding application with effect from the date the maintenance enquiry form had been sent to (as distinct from received by) the father (R(CS) 1/99 followed as to the correct test for the start date of a maintenance assessment), and the tribunal’s finding that there was no evidence that the father had been notified of the application was inadequate in view of the evidence that the maintenance enquiry form had been sent to the father (paragraphs 13 to 15);
2.	paragraph 16(4) applies only after a maintenance assessment has been made, but where the Secretary of State is considering the assessment to be made over a past period during which the other parent has not made any maintenance application, there is no question of cancelling any assessment. The question then is what assessments should be made in favour of the person who has made the application, using the power in paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 as necessary to make separate maintenance assessments in respect of different periods, including periods where there is no liability (paragraphs 22 and 23);
The Commissioner remitted the case to be heard by a differently constituted appeal tribunal with guidance (in paragraphs 24 to 26) as to the general principles to be applied in considering the changes in the provision of day to day care during the period in question.

Commissioners’ jurisdiction – whether a tribunal’s breach of a procedural requirement necessarily renders its decision erroneous in point of law
In both appeals the tribunal was unable to produce a legible copy of the record of proceedings. Regulation 55 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decision and Appeals) Regulations 1999 required a record of proceedings to be made, kept and provided to the parties upon request. The claimant in each appeal argued that a failure to comply with regulation 55 rendered the tribunal’s decision erroneous in point of law.  A Tribunal of Commissioners was appointed to consider the issue in light of the differing approaches of individual Commissioners.
Held, dismissing the appeal in CSDLA/500/2007 but allowing the appeal in CSLDA/524/2007, that:
1.	a tribunal’s record of proceedings should be a record of what happened and in addition to indicating the evidence taken, should include a record of any procedural application and its result (paragraph 6). It is good practice to include a brief note of any submissions made (paragraph 10);
2.	the duty to make a record of proceedings does not extend to making a note of the tribunal’s deliberations (paragraph 26);
3.	the record of proceedings must be intelligible or capable of being made intelligible to those to whom it is issued (paragraphs 13 and 14);
4.	a failure to comply with regulation 55 will not necessarily render the tribunal’s decision erroneous in point of law; the failure to comply must be material to the decision in the sense that it has resulted in a real possibility of unfairness or injustice. In so far as they suggest otherwise, CDLA/4110/1997, CIB/3013/1997 and CA/3479/2000 should no longer be followed (paragraph 27);
5.	the extent to which, in a particular case, a lack of a record of proceedings results in unfairness or injustice may turn on the extent to which the deficiency can be made good, for example, by obtaining evidence as to what happened at the hearing from the parties or the tribunal. However, a proportionate approach is required and some social security cases will not justify detailed investigation; in such a case a Commissioner should not be slow to find that the failure to comply with regulation 55 renders the tribunal’s decision erroneous in law (paragraph 28);
6.	in CSDLA/500/2007 no unfairness had resulted from the lack of a record of proceedings (paragraphs 32 and 33) but in CSDLA/524/2007 the tribunal’s reasons did not explain the evidential basis for the decision and an explanation could not be found in the illegible record of proceedings, it being too late to require the tribunal chairman to provide a legible transcript (paragraph 44); 
7.	it was unnecessary to consider, in relation to CSDLA/524/2007, whether the tribunal’s decision was erroneous in point of law because of a four-month delay in issuing a statement of reasons. However, the Tribunal of Commissioners observed that R(IS) 5/04 appeared to be consistent with the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Bangs v Connex South Eastern Limited [2005] EWCA Civ 14, [2005] 2 All ER 316 (paragraph 45).

The claimant’s accountant had lent him money by paying his rent directly to his landlord for about 20–25 months between August 1998 and May 2001, during most of which period his claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit were under consideration. The council decided that he was not entitled to benefit for the period 13 March 2000 to 7 May 2001 because the loans constituted part of his income and that this took his income to a level at which he was no longer entitled to benefit. The claimant appealed. An appeal tribunal upheld the council’s decision, relying on Court and Commissioners’ decisions relating to income support, including Leeves v Chief Adjudication Officer, [1999] ELR 90, also reported as R(IS) 5/99, and Morrell v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] EWCA Civ 526, reported as R(IS) 6/03, as authority for concluding that as a matter of law there was no general principle that loans should be treated as capital rather than income unless there was an immediate and certain obligation to repay and finding that on the facts of this case, the obligation to repay, while certain, was not immediate at any time during the relevant period. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while housing benefit and council tax benefit are different benefits from income support, all are means-tested under Part VII of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and a similar approach to construction should apply (paragraph 14);
2.	Leeves and Morrell held that while loans, and in particular recurrent loans, may well be income if there is no immediate repayment obligation, all the facts and circumstances need to be examined to decide if this is the case, and the tribunal had failed to apply those cases correctly, as had the Commissioners in R(H) 1/05 and CH/3393/2003 (R v West Dorset DC ex parte Poupard (1988) 20 HLR 295, [1988] RVR 40  distinguished) (paragraphs 21 to 28);
3.	the tribunal therefore erred in law in failing to consider whether, in the absence of an immediate obligation to repay, any of the loans made between March 2000 to May 2001 were properly to be considered as income for any weeks in that period (paragraph 29).

The claimant was living on a canal narrow boat at a British Waterways mooring. He had no other home and the boat was fitted out for permanent residence. The boat was registered as a leisure craft and not as a houseboat. The claimant had a cruising licence. He was refused a mooring licence by British Waterways to continue at the mooring, where he had been for a couple of months, but he was unable to relocate the boat and stayed at the mooring. He was invoiced for mooring charges and he claimed housing benefit in respect of those mooring charges. The authority refused this claim on the basis there was no planning consent for residential use and also doubted that a residential narrow boat constituted a “houseboat” within the regulations. The claimant appealed. The tribunal upheld the decision of the authority, and the claimant appealed to the Commissioner. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it was not relevant for the purposes of regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 whether the use of the mooring was lawful or whether there was planning permission (paragraph 18);
2.	regulation 10(1) provides that “ the payments in respect of which housing benefit is payable … are the following periodical payments which a person is liable to make in respect of the dwelling which he occupies as his home” and the mooring charges payable by the claimant came within this definition. It was not a necessary part of the concept of a “home” that there were facilities, utilities, shops or security arrangements (paragraph 17); 
3.	for the purposes of the housing benefit regulations, “houseboat” is an ordinary English word without a technical meaning. The tribunal was mistaken in its reliance on the lack of a licence for residential mooring and on the form of registration of the boat. It is a matter of fact in an individual case whether a boat is a “houseboat” (paragraphs 19 and 20);  
The Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal. He substituted his own decision that, subject to the satisfaction of other conditions of entitlement, the claimant was entitled to housing benefit.

European Union law – free movement – whether workseeker has a right of residence
The claimant was a Dutch national who came to the United Kingdom with her three children on 1 May 2004.  She claimed income support on 17 November 2004. The Secretary of State disallowed the claim on the ground that the claimant had no right of residence and therefore could not be treated as habitually resident in the United Kingdom with the result that she was a “person from abroad” with an applicable amount of nil by virtue of regulation 21 of, and paragraph 17 of Schedule 7 to, the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, as amended. The claimant appealed. The tribunal found that she had been looking for work since she had arrived in the United Kingdom but dismissed her appeal on the ground that, because she had not at the time of the Secretary of State’s decision worked in the United Kingdom, she had no right of residence as a “worker” and she was patently no longer “self-sufficient”. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a claimant has a right of residence under Article 39 of the EC Treaty as a workseeker, in the light of Regina v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Antonissen (Case C-292/89) [1991] ECR I-745, where he or she is seeking employment and has a genuine chance of being engaged, and such a right of residence is now guaranteed by Article 14(4)(b) of Council Directive 2004/38/EC and is conferred by regulation 6 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 from 30 April 2006 as a matter of domestic law (paragraph 5);
2.	although some people may be available for work and be actively seeking employment but not have a genuine chance of being engaged, the requirement that a person have a genuine chance of being engaged will seldom be significant and in other cases it is not helpful to reject a claim solely on the ground of the lack of a right of residence without reference to the underlying ground that would apply to British citizens as well as other EEA nationals (paragraph 6);
3.	until 30 April 2006, a claimant of income support was not precluded from establishing a right of residence as a workseeker but, contrary to a submission of the Secretary of State, a workseeker must be seeking work that is genuine and effective (paragraph 7);
4.	employment for at least 16 hours a week, which is the minimum amount of work for which a person with caring responsibilities claiming jobseeker’s allowance is required to be available, can generally be taken as effective (paragraph 7);
5.	in the circumstances of the case, it was not necessary to go behind the Secretary of State’s concession that, on the facts found by the tribunal, the claimant had a right of residence (paragraph 8).

The absent parent father applied for a supersession of the maintenance assessment then in place on the ground of change of circumstances (his change of employer and new housing costs). The new assessment, based on gross annual earnings of £11, 625, resulted in a nil liability (down from £121.41 per week previously). The parent with care mother appealed against that assessment and also against the decision-maker’s refusal to make departure directions. The main issue before the tribunal was the proper treatment of the father’s “salary sacrifice” arrangements under the Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases Regulations 1992 (the MASC regulations). The father’s total remuneration package (TRP) was £60,000 per annum and he had joined his company’s senior staff pension fund. The fund permitted members with a TRP to select a level of contributions to be made to the scheme by the employer. The father had opted to have £4,000 per month (£48,000 per annum) put into the scheme – leaving £11,625 per annum to be drawn by him as salary. He had also sacrificed a further sum of £375 per annum in respect of his employer’s payment of a health insurance policy under which he was covered. The father indicated that his mortgage lender had only been prepared to grant an interest-only mortgage over 18 years providing that there was an appropriate vehicle (ie the pension fund) in place to secure repayment of the mortgage at the end of the term. The mother queried the true level of the father’s remuneration and argued that he had apparently deliberately reduced his salary knowing that it would have a significant effect on the calculation of maintenance. The tribunal allowed the mother’s appeal against the assessment and decided that the father’s annual net income included the sums of £11,625 and £375 (both subject to the deduction of income tax and national insurance contributions), plus, applying paragraph 1(3)(b) of Schedule 1 to the MASC regulations,  £24,000 (not subject to deductions) – ie one half the total sum which he had elected to sacrifice for his pension contributions. The CSA’s presenting officer estimated that the tribunal’s decision would result in a weekly liability in the region of £150 and, in the light of that, the tribunal dismissed the mother’s appeals on the departure directions. In granting the father leave to appeal, the Commissioner noted that for a salary sacrifice arrangement to be accepted by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) there needed to be a variation of the employment contract so that the employee was no longer legally entitled to the amount of the remuneration sacrificed. In those circumstances it was arguable that the sum sacrificed could not properly be regarded as earnings and that the only way in which the parent could be treated as having earnings of that amount would be via the operation of paragraphs 26 and 27 of Schedule 1 to the MASC regulations.  
Held, allowing the appeal and remitting the case for re-hearing by a new tribunal, that:
1.	the essence of a salary sacrifice pension arrangement is that the contributions are made as the employer’s contributions and that the employee has agreed in a contractually valid way to give up the right to cash payment of the amount of salary sacrificed (paragraph 18);
2.	in this case, the salary sacrifice pension arrangement had clearly been accepted by HMRC and the payments were clearly made by the employer – the tribunal was therefore in error of law both in proceeding on the basis that the father was contractually entitled to cash remuneration of £60,000 per annum and in its application of paragraph 1(3)(b) of Schedule 1 to the MASC regs to the £48,000 sum sacrificed for the pension contributions (paragraphs 18 and 21);
3.	the employer’s contributions to the fund, if regarded as part of the father’s remuneration or profit derived from his employment, fell within the one of the categories specifically stated not to be earnings in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 – ie a “tax-exempt allowance” under paragraph 1(2)(h) (paragraphs 19 and 20);  
4.	the father could not be treated as having earnings of £48,000 per year by virtue of the application of paragraph 26 of Schedule 1 to the MASC regulations because, although he performed services for the benefit of his employers for less remuneration than would normally be paid and the remuneration foregone would otherwise have fallen to be taken into account as earnings (so satisfying sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of paragraph 26), the tribunal had made no findings of fact relevant to the crucial condition contained in sub-paragraph (d) as to whether the father’s principal purpose in performing the services for less remuneration was to reduce his assessable income for child support purposes (paragraph 24);
5.	the test as to whether the condition in sub-paragraph (d) is satisfied is a subjective one – the test is not merely whether the parent’s intention was to reduce income in general (with a side effect of there being a reduction in the amount of assessable income for child support purposes) – rather  the test is focused on the parent’s intention in reducing the income (the decision in CCS/3675/2004 followed) (paragraph 24);
6.	paragraph 27 of Schedule 1 to the MASC regulations can also be potentially relevant in salary sacrifice cases; however it can only apply where one or more of the conditions in heads (a) to (e) of paragraph 26 are not met (paragraph 26).

The claimant applied for asylum and in due course was notified that she had been recorded as a refugee. On 10 January 2006 she claimed state pension credit and applied for any award of income support or state pension credit to be backdated to the date of her asylum claim. Because she made her claim within 28 days of the notification that she had been recorded as a refugee, the claimant would have been entitled under regulation 21ZB of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 to benefit backdated to the date of her asylum claim if her claim had been for income support. However she was advised that there was no provision similar to regulation 21ZB relating to state pension credit, and she was awarded state pension credit only from 12 January 2006. The claimant appealed against the refusal to backdate the award to the date of her asylum application. A tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner, relying on the argument that the failure to make regulations allowing backdating of an award of state pension credit to a successful asylum-seeker was in breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights read with Article 1 Protocol 1. It was not disputed that discrimination on age grounds fell within Article 14. It was submitted on behalf of the claimant that entitlement to state pension credit fell within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1 as a possession, on the ground either that contributory and non-contributory benefits are both within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol 1, following the admissibility decision in Stec v United Kingdom (application nos 67531/01 and 65900/01) in preference to Carson and Reynolds v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37, [2006] 1 AC 173 and other domestic authorities, or alternatively that the savings credit element in state pension credit makes it similar to a contributory benefit. The Commissioner was invited to interpret regulation 21ZB of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as applying to state pension credit.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the savings credit element in state pension credit is payable to pensioners who have private pensions or similar income resulting from their own savings, and was therefore not analogous to benefit entitlement which is dependant on contributions (paragraph 9);
2.	following Kay v Lambeth LBC, Leeds CC v Price [2006] UKHL 10, [2006] 2 AC 465, the question whether state pension credit, as a non-contributory benefit, fell within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1 fell to be decided under the ordinary domestic rules of precedent, unless the case fell within the rare category of exceptions, and the fact that the House of Lords in Carson and Reynolds had expressly left open the question of whether non-contributory benefits fell within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1 pending the decision in Stec did not justify departing from the domestic authorities, including that of Couronne v Crawley Borough Council [2006] EWHC 1514 (Admin), where Stec was expressly not followed (paragraph 9); 
3.	however, even if Stec were followed, there was no effective remedy which the Commissioner could give the claimant, since section 123 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 Act expressly provided for the regulation-making power which it created to be exercised in relation to state pension credit by regulations made under the State Pension Credit Act 2002, and it was therefore not possible to interpret the section as also empowering the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 to make provision for awards of state pension credit to be backdated as such an interpretation would expressly contradict the meaning of the enactment (R v Lambert [2001] UKHL 37, [2002] 2 AC 545  and Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] UKHL 30, [2004] 2 AC 557 followed) (paragraphs 12 and 13).

The claimant was the tenant of a council flat in the respondent’s area. The management of her flat and tenancy was the responsibility of the council’s relevant district housing office. The claimant was in receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit, administered by the council’s benefits service, which was a different department from that of the housing offices. The claimant was in Ghana between November 2005 and October 2006. She stated that on a number of occasions during her absence she had informed the district housing office of her absence. The council decided that the claimant had not been entitled to benefit during her absence abroad and that benefit given had been overpaid and was recoverable. The claimant appealed against both the entitlement and the overpayment decision. The tribunal upheld both decisions, finding that the claimant had failed to discharge her duty to inform the relevant department. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner against the decision on recoverability, submitting that the tribunal had failed to consider whether failure by one department of the authority to pass on information to another constituted official error for the purposes of regulation 81 of the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006, whether that error caused the overpayment, and, if it did, whether the claimant could reasonably have been expected to realise she was being overpaid. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in failing to consider whether the alleged omission of the housing office to pass on information to the benefits service amounted to an “official error” as defined in regulation 81; however, such a finding would have to be based on either a reasonably based expectation that the information would be passed on to the benefits service or the existence of internal arrangements or practices for passing on information (paragraphs 24 to 26);
2.	for the purposes of the definition of official error in regulation 81, an officer of the housing office was an officer of the “relevant authority” and that interpretation was supported by the different wording in regulation 69, which required notification of a change of circumstances to a “designated office” (CH/2321/2002 cited) (paragraphs 27 to 29);
3.	the tribunal should also have considered and determined whether the overpayments were caused by a wholly uninduced official error or were rather the result of the claimant’s failure in breach of duty to inform the benefits service of her change in circumstances, following the approach of asking what was the substantial cause of the overpayment set out in R (Sier) v Cambridge City Council Housing Benefit Review Board [2001] EWCA Civ 1523 (paragraph 30).

",,"Variation – dividend – period in respect of which the conditions in regulation 19(1A) of the Variations Regulations 2000 must be satisfied
The father was paying child support maintenance under a maintenance calculation. On 30 March 2005 he received a dividend from his company. The mother became aware of that and on 20 December 2005 made an application for a variation of the calculation. The Secretary of State determined that, to take account of the dividend, the maintenance calculation should be varied under regulation 19(1A) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000, in force from 6 April 2005, which applies where the non-resident parent (a) has the ability to control the amount of income he receives from a company and (b) is receiving income from that company which would not otherwise fall to be taken into account. The Secretary of State superseded the assessment and decided that an increased amount of maintenance was payable for the period from the commencement of the week in which the application was made down to 29 March 2006, treating the dividend as paid by equal weekly instalments over the year from 30 March 2005. The father appealed to a child support appeal tribunal, which confirmed the decision. The father appealed to the Commissioner, who allowed his appeal, holding that the natural meaning of regulation 19(1A) was that one had to look at the period from the effective date of the application for a variation down to the date of the decision, and that, as the dividend had been declared in respect of the year ending 31 July 2005 the condition was not satisfied during any part of that period, and therefore the variation had not been properly made under regulation 19(1A). The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, submitting that the year to which “the weekly amount” relates must necessarily be a year going forward from the date of the payment.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	(per Arden LJ) the function of regulation 19(1A) is merely to identify a “case”, or state of affairs, on the basis of which the Secretary of State can exercise his discretion to direct a variation, and, provided the non-resident parent had control of the company at the time of receipt of the dividend, the conditions are fulfilled (paragraphs 13 and 14);
2.	(per Arden LJ) the mechanism for ascertaining the weekly amount of additional income is provided by regulation 25 and merely involves dividing the amount of the dividend by 52 (paragraphs 15 to 18);
3.	(per Arden LJ) it followed that there was no need for the Secretary of State to consider the period with respect to which the dividend was stated by the company to be paid or the fiscal year, and the weekly amount must be notionally related to the weeks succeeding the date of payment because it cannot otherwise be added to any future payment, as regulation 25 clearly contemplates (paragraph 19);
4.	(per Arden LJ) regulation 19(1A) imposes no requirement that a dividend payment should be of a regular amount, and accordingly is capable of applying to a single payment of a dividend (paragraph 21);
5.	(per Arden LJ) the application of regulation 19(1A) to dividend income received prior to the commencement date of regulation 19(1A) did not offend the principle against the retrospective application of legislation, since it only affected such income after the commencement date and therefore is taken to operate prospectively only (Wilson v First County Trust (No 2) [2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 AC 816 cited) (paragraphs 22 and 23);
6.	(per Longmore LJ) the question for the purpose of regulation 19(1A)(b) was not in respect of what year was the dividend to be treated as paid but whether the non-resident parent was “receiving” income in the form of a dividend (paragraphs 26, 27 and 33); 
7.	(per Longmore LJ) “receipt” being a continuing concept, the regulation must be construed as applying to a period subsequent to the date of payment, and it would not be practicable for that period to be as short as a week or even a month (paragraphs 28 to 32);
8.	(per Longmore LJ) in the present case, the non-resident parent was still “receiving” the income on the date of the application and it ought therefore to be brought into account (paragraph 34).

Precedent – Commissioners’ decisions – whether later decision to be followed in preference to earlier reported decision 
The claimant was a foster carer and was paid a weekly payment by the local authority consisting of a Boarding Out Allowance and a fostering Fee. She did not spend all the money in the week to which it related, with the result that sums accumulated. She also received payments from relatives of the foster children to be used for their benefit in due course, which she put into a separate account. The weekly payments were disregarded in the calculation of her income support and jobseeker’s allowance. She did not disclose the accumulating funds to the Secretary of State. On discovering what had happened, the Secretary of State decided that benefit had been overpaid and was recoverable on the ground that the claimant had failed to disclose the amount of her capital. The claimant appealed to a tribunal, which decided that the money was capital and was not held on trust, preferring R(IS) 3/93 to CIS/515/2006 on the question of the point at which income becomes capital. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was argued for the claimant that the Boarding Out Allowance was held on trust by the claimant for the children, and also that CIS/515/2006 was authority for the general proposition that capital should be identified on an annual, rather than weekly, basis. It was argued, citing R(IS) 13/01, that the Commissioner in CIS/515/2006 had in effect considered and rejected the reasoning in R(IS) 3/93 and that therefore CIS/515/2006, as the later decision, should be followed in preference to R(IS) 3/93.
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting decisions to broadly the same effect, that:
1.	there was no basis for finding either that the claimant had declared a trust or that one had been imposed on her by law, since there was nothing inherent in the arrangement between the claimant and the local authority that prevented her making use of the money at her disposal as she thought fit, provided that over time the foster children received the benefit of the Allowance (paragraphs 11 to 21);
2.	R(IS) 13/01 was no longer good law as to precedent, since it applied Colchester Estates (Cardiff) v Carlton Industries plc [1986] Ch 80, which had been disapproved in Re Taylor (a bankrupt) [2006] EWHC 3029 (Ch), [2007] Ch 150 (paragraphs 25 to 27);
3.	the tribunal was right to apply R(IS) 3/93 in preference to CIS/515/2006, both because the former was a reported decision and therefore considered by the majority of the Commissioners at the time to be at least broadly correct, and because its reasoning that earnings, being income for a specified period, must become capital once that period has expired, was sound (paragraphs 28 to 30);
4.	however, the tribunal had erred in law in failing to make it clear that the money paid by relatives of the foster children and held in a separate account was held in trust and did not form part of the claimant’s capital, and that advance payments could not be taken into account, as either income or capital, before the period to which they related (both of which points had been conceded by the Secretary of State) (paragraphs 31 to 34). 	
The Commissioner remitted the case to be re-decided by the Secretary of State in accordance with his directions.

A claim made in 1994 had been disallowed because the claimant did not satisfy the contribution conditions although she was accepted as qualifying for incapacity credits. On 10 December 2003 the claimant’s GP signed a questionnaire giving a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II, date of onset 1996, and stating that she was stable on medication. The claimant completed an IB50 questionnaire and a medical adviser gave the opinion that she fell into an exempt category of mental illness (but with the suggestion that her functional capacity would be expected to improve significantly within 18 months). Accordingly, from 5 February 2004 the claimant was treated as incapable of work under regulation 10(2)(e)(viii) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 (severe mental illness having severe mental effects) (“the regulation 10 exemption”). On 25 October 2005 the claimant completed a further IB50 questionnaire and was subsequently examined by an examining medical practitioner (EMP) who recorded the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and the current medication taken and expressed the opinion that the claimant had no problem with any physical activity and that only three point-scoring mental health descriptors applied. The EMP considered that her condition was well stabilised with minimal remaining disability and ticked that there would be no substantial risk to the mental or physical health of any person if she were found capable of work and answered “no” to the other questions arising under regulation 27 of the 1995 regulations. On the basis of that evidence the decision awarding incapacity credits was superseded and a decision given that the claimant did not score enough points to satisfy the personal capability assessment (PCA) and was not incapable of work. The claimant appealed and the tribunal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the claimant was not automatically exempted on the basis of her diagnosis and medication and that she no longer fell into an exempt category under the regulation 10 exemption. The tribunal further concluded that the claimant satisfied only one additional mental health descriptor. The Commissioner gave leave to appeal on the grounds submitted on behalf of the claimant, namely (i) that the tribunal had misinterpreted a further potentially applicable descriptor and (ii) that the tribunal had failed to have regard to CIB/3328/1998 (regarding recourse to the Incapacity Benefit Handbook for Approved Doctors) (the Commissioner noting that whilst that Handbook had been referred to before the tribunal, CIB/3328/1998 had not then been specifically relied on).
Held, allowing the appeal and remitting the case to differently constituted tribunal for re-hearing, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred by not adequately considering two additional descriptors (although that in itself would not have justified allowing the appeal (paragraph 15);
2.	a claimant’s capacity for work should be judged according to the practical reality from time to time, including the beneficial effect of medicines and other treatments that it is reasonable for a person to accept, subject to any adverse effects of the treatment (paragraphs 16 and 17);
3.	the argument that the interpretation of the regulation 10 exemption was affected by the way in which the 1997 amendment which introduced it was put to the Social Security Advisory Committee should be rejected because the conclusion in Commissioner’s decision CSIB/169/2005 that that amendment was valid under Howker v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 1623, [2003] ICR 405, also reported as R(IB) 3/03, did not imply that it was neutral in effect and to be interpreted in line with the previous form of regulation 10(2)(e)(viii) and the guidance given to doctors; and in any event that guidance did not suggest that a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder or long-term lithium medication was conclusive in itself (paragraphs 18 to 25);
4.	leaving aside that stabilisation is different from freedom from symptoms, the tribunal had erred in its consideration of regulation 27 of the 1995 regulations by failing to consider whether that stabilisation was likely to survive the stresses of work of the sort that the claimant might be required to look for under the jobseeker’s allowance regime (paragraph 26);
In addition, the Commissioner commented on what Commissioner’s decision CIB/3328/1998 stands for.

The claimant was a male-to-female transsexual who lived as a man until shortly before attaining the female pension age of 60 in July 1994. She claimed and was awarded retirement pension in 1999 from the male pension age of 65. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into effect in April 2005 and the claimant obtained a full gender recognition certificate in May 2005. Her retirement pension was recalculated from June 2005 with the effect that her earnings-related additional pension as a woman was slightly reduced. In May 2006 the claimant applied for her pension to be awarded to her as a woman back to her 60th birthday, asserting entitlement to equal treatment under Article 4(1) of Council Directive 79/7 with a person of the same age born a female, based on the ruling by the European Court of Justice in Case C-423/04 Richards v Secretary of State [2006] ECR I-3585 (now reported as R(P) 1/07) issued on 27 April 2006. A decision-maker refused the application on the basis that that she had not claimed at the age of 60 and the 12-month time limit for claims applied. The claimant appealed and a tribunal upheld that decision, also holding that she could have no claim under the Directive. The claimant appealed to the Commissioners. 
Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:
1.	the claimant was entitled to assert a claim under the direct effect of Article 4(1) on the basis of equal treatment with any other person of her acquired gender, and the tribunal had erred in law in holding the Gender Recognition Act removed any scope for such a claim (R(P) 1/09 paragraphs 19, 29 to 31 and the cases there cited) (paragraphs 31 and 32);
2.	any such claim or application for earlier or extra benefit by virtue of the Directive was however subject to the same general procedural requirements, time limits and restrictions as any corresponding applications under domestic law (R(P) 1/09 paragraphs 21, 33 to 35 and the cases there cited) (paragraphs 34 and 35);
3.	applying those requirements, the claimant’s application of May 2006 could only be considered as one for the alteration of the retirement pension she had already duly claimed and been awarded in 1999, not as a fresh or separate claim. The only relevant power to alter that award was to supersede it under section 10 of the Social Security Act 1998 with effect from the date of her application. There was no ground to revise it back to its original date, as any error in failing to accord equal treatment as required by the Directive was only shown to be so by Richards, and so was outside the definition of “official error” permitting such revision in regulation 1(3) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (paragraphs 38 to 44); 
4.	the decision to reduce the claimant’s pension in June 2005 was open to question and required to be reconsidered, for possible separate revision of the claimant’s award back to that date if it had failed to give effect to paragraph 7(4) of Schedule 5 to the Gender Recognition Act as regards her earnings-related benefit (paragraphs 45 and 46); 
5.	in either case the claimant was entitled to have included in her pension, from the effective date of the superseding or revised decision, a percentage increase for deferment of her pension under section 55 of the Contributions and Benefits Act, measured from the date when she could first have claimed it under the Directive until its actual starting date in 1999: in this respect the special provisions in Schedule 5 to the Gender Recognition Act fell short of what was required for equal treatment (paragraphs 47 to 48);
6.	for that purpose the date when the claimant had first become entitled to the benefit of equal  treatment in her acquired gender was to be determined by applying the same tests as in the Gender Recognition Act, even as regards periods before it came into force (R(P) 1/09 paragraphs 38 to 41; CP/3485/2003 approved and followed) (paragraph 49).

The claimant and his wife held a long lease of a former local authority flat. The lease required the payment of estimated service charges and of any shortfall when the actual charges were calculated after the end of the financial year. The claimant was awarded income support in 2002, which by the time of his appeal had been converted into state pension credit. The service charges were included in the calculation of both benefits. Initially the 2002/03 service charges were paid on the basis of the level of service charges for the year 2001/02, but on 5 March 2003 the decision awarding income support was purportedly revised, so as to reduce the amount of housing costs to the estimated 2002/03 figure. However the actual service charges for 2002/03 as invoiced in September 2003 were higher than the estimate. The claimant did not inform the Secretary of State of the increase until November 2004. The Secretary of State refused to award the difference on the basis that the decision sought to be revised was the revision decision of 5 March 2003, so that the application made on 22 November 2004 was outside the absolute 13-month time limit imposed by regulation 4(3)(b) of the Social Security (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. The claimant appealed and a tribunal dismissed his appeal.
Held, allowing the appeal but substituting one to the same effect, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law by treating the case as one of revision, since the award should have been superseded for a change of circumstances because the claimant’s liability for the actual service charges was a new liability which was separate from the liability to pay estimated service charges (paragraphs 8 to 10 and 17);
2.	paragraph 13 of Schedule II to the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 requires housing costs to be calculated on a weekly basis and the expiry of the 52-week period over which housing costs must be paid is a change of circumstances. The decision-maker can make a composite decision increasing the award by the weekly amount of the housing costs, and at the same time terminating the award 52 weeks later under regulation 6(2)(a)(ii) of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations on the basis of an anticipated change of circumstances at the end of the 52-week period (paragraph 12);
3.	in order for regulation 7 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations to provide an effective sanction in respect of late supersession applications relating to housing costs, paragraph 13 of Schedule II to the 2002 Regulations must be read as requiring housing costs to be calculated on a weekly basis commencing on the date on which the liability for the costs arose, and a claimant who makes a supersession application more than one month after incurring liability for a housing cost and who cannot bring himself within the conditions for a longer period to be allowed under regulation 8 of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations is entitled to an increase in benefit only during the balance of the 52-week period (paragraph 16); 
4.	in this case, the 52-week period had expired when the claimant informed the Secretary of State of his liability for the final amount of service charges for 2002/03 and he did not satisfy the conditions in regulation 8, so that he was not entitled to a supersession decision in respect of his liability for those costs (paragraphs 16 and 17).

The claimant was receiving income support, which included personal allowances for her two daughters. Both daughters had savings accounts, which at the time of her claim contained less than £2,500. Over the years the balance in both accounts increased to over £3,000, at which level the claimant was no longer entitled to personal allowances for the children. However, the claimant did not inform the Secretary of State of the change of circumstances. When it came to light, a substantial overpayment had arisen and the Secretary of State decided that it was recoverable because the claimant had failed to disclose that her daughters’ capital had increased above £3,000. The claimant appealed and an appeal tribunal dismissed her appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner raised the issue of the application of regulation 14(1) of the Social Security (Payments on account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988 (the Payments Regulations) to the capital of children. Regulation 14(1) provides that, where income support has been overpaid in consequence of a misrepresentation of or failure to disclose “the capital a claimant possesses” the amount of a claimant’s capital taken into account in the calculation of an overpayment is to be reduced at the end of each 13 weeks by the amount of income support overpaid in those 13 weeks. The Secretary of State argued that that provision applied only to a claimant’s capital and not that of a claimant’s children.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in this context the word “claimant” must be given the meaning given to it for the purposes of the treatment of capital resources as set out in the second part of regulation 23(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations, in the form still in force at the relevant dates, which on its precise wording is not subject to the restriction in its first part and so provides for both income and capital of all children and young persons who are members of the family of the person claiming income support as defined in and under section 137(1) of the Contributions and Benefits Act to be aggregated (paragraph 18);
2.	accordingly, when regulation 14(1) of the Payments Regulations refers to cases where income support has been overpaid in consequence of a misrepresentation of or failure to disclose “the capital a claimant possesses” the reference includes cases where the capital concerned was possessed by a child or young person who was a member of the family of the person claiming income support (paragraph 19);
3.	even if that were wrong, the existence of regulation 14 did not exclude the operation of a diminishing capital principle, based (following R(SB) 15/85) on the recoverability of overpayments under section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 being restricted to payments made in consequence of a misrepresentation or failure to disclose a material fact and to payments that the Secretary of State would not have made but for the misrepresentation or failure to disclose (paragraph 21);
4.	the claimant had, albeit innocently and without fraudulent intent, failed to disclose the change of circumstances that the children’s capital had increased above £3,000 and an overpayment was recoverable of a reduced amount applying regulation 14 (paragraphs 22 to 32).

The claimant began to look after her 14-year old granddaughter, whose behaviour was worsening her mother’s depression. The claimant’s daughter continued receiving child benefit, and paying it to the claimant, for a short period, after which it was awarded to the claimant. The claimant claimed income support as a lone parent under paragraph 1 of Schedule 1B to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. The Secretary of State refused her claim for the period before she was awarded child benefit and an appeal tribunal confirmed that decision. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had been correct to find that the claimant was not a lone parent as defined by regulations 2(1) and 15(1) of the 1987 Regulations, since she was not to be treated as responsible for a child unless she was receiving child benefit, “receiving” in that context having the meaning  “having claimed and been awarded” (CIS/2317/2006 followed) (paragraphs 6 to 9);
2.	however, the tribunal had failed to consider the possibility that the claimant fell within the category prescribed by paragraph 3 of Schedule 1B, headed “Persons temporarily looking after another person” (paragraphs 10 and 11);
3.	despite the heading to paragraph 3, it was not necessary on the wording of paragraph 3(a) for the care arrangement to be temporary in a case where the claimant was looking after a child because the parent was unable to provide care through illness, and that interpretation was re-enforced by the contrast in wording with paragraph 3(b) and was a coherent and rational interpretation taken with the law on child benefit (paragraphs 13 to 15);
1.	4.	the claimant therefore satisfied paragraph 3 of Schedule 1B for the period until she was awarded child benefit (paragraphs 1 and 16).

The claimant was made redundant after 43 years of work, the last 20 years as a senior finance manager. He claimed and was awarded jobseeker’s allowance, but after two weeks started work for 20 hours a week as a control assistant with an ambulance service. However, he left the job after slightly less than a month, during which time he had worked five shifts including training. He made a new claim for jobseeker’s allowance, which was awarded, but after two months the Secretary of State superseded the award and decided that, under section 19(1), (3) and (6)(b) of the Jobseekers Act 1995, jobseeker’s allowance should not be paid for a period of six weeks because the claimant had voluntarily left his employment with the ambulance service without just cause. The claimant appealed, but the appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner against the decision of the tribunal as to both the imposition of the sanction and its length. His main arguments were that the job was one that he could not have been required to take under section 19(6)(c) during his “permitted period” of restriction of availability under regulation 16 of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996, and that, had he been unemployed for longer, he could have availed himself of the trial period concession in regulation 74 of those Regulations.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	while there may be circumstances in which grounds upon which a claimant could have declined a job could amount to just cause for leaving it, the mere fact that a claimant could have declined a job does not give him just cause for voluntarily leaving the employment later (paragraph 14);
2.	similarly the mere fact that an employment was a stop-gap until a claimant found something more suitable did not justify him in leaving a job without reasonable prospects of obtaining other employment and the tribunal had been entitled to find that the claimant did not have just cause for leaving his employment (R(U) 14/53 distinguished) (paragraphs 15 and 16);
3.	however, the fact that the claimant need not have taken employment will be highly relevant to the length of the period for which a sanction is imposed if the claimant has left the employment voluntarily (paragraph 18);
4.	while it might well be reasonable to impose the minimum sanction of one week in a stop-gap case where a claimant met all the conditions of the trial period rules in regulation 74 other than the 13 weeks of previous employment, in the present case the claimant had not met all the other conditions which required a claimant to give a job a fair trial, and the tribunal was entitled to take the view that the claimant had left prematurely, notwithstanding that he need not have taken the job in the first place (paragraphs 19 and 20);
5.	in the present case a sanction for six weeks was reasonable, reflecting the balance of the minimum trial period required by regulation 74(4), plus a further period to reflect the possibility that, if the claimant had given the job a longer trial, he might have decided to remain in it (paragraphs 21 and 22).

Recovery of overpayment – amount recoverable – hypothetical reduction of capital – whether increases in actual capital during assessed income period to be taken into account 
The claimant signed a claim form for state pension credit in which “no” was ticked in reply to the question whether she had any savings or investments. The form included a declaration that “the information I have given on the form is correct and complete as far as I know and believe, and I have included all of my income and savings”. She received pension credit from 6 October 2003 until her death in 2005. It was then discovered that she had savings well above the limit of £6,000 at which tariff income fell to be calculated. A decision was given on revision that the claimant had been entitled to pension credit at a reduced rate for the period, on the basis of money in her accounts at 6 October 2003, which included four weeks’ receipt of retirement pension. It was further decided that overpaid benefit would not have been paid but for misrepresentation on her claim form and was recoverable from her estate. The claimant’s executor appealed, suggesting that the claimant, because of her disabilities, might not have understood the question about savings on the claim form. The appeal tribunal disallowed the appeal. The executor appealed to the Commissioner. The main issue before the Commissioner was whether current receipts of retirement pension should count as capital. The Secretary of State submitted that the principle in R(IS) 3/93 that income becomes capital only if it is unspent after the period to which it would have to be attributed did not apply to state pension credit, because there was no provision in the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 for attribution of income to a particular period.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant’s declaration as to the inclusion of all income and savings was not restricted to information within her knowledge and there was no sufficient basis for a conclusion that she was not to be taken as having made the misrepresentation on the form she signed in the absence of evidence that the document she thought she was signing on was fundamentally different from what it actually was (R(IS) 4/06 and Chief Adjudication Officer v Sherriff, R(IS) 14/96 followed) (paragraphs 14 to 19);
2.	R(IS) 3/93 was based on the general proposition, supported by R(SB) 2/83 and R(SB) 35/83, that payments received as income were not capital merely because of their receipt into a claimant’s current account, but only after their transformation into capital, and was not dependent on the existence of the specific rule in the relevant Regulations about attribution of income, which was merely adopted as a convenient measure of the timing of the transformation  (paragraph 23);
3.	even if that were wrong, the state pension credit legislation must work on an assumed notion of a period of attribution to identify what income a claimant has on the start date of the assessed income period (paragraph 24);
4.	the main indicator of the metamorphosis into capital of income paid in respect of a period will therefore be the expiry of a length of time equal to that period, giving effect to the ordinary meanings of capital and income (paragraph 25);
5.	accordingly, the appeal tribunal erred in law by including the four weeks’ receipt of retirement pension as part of the claimant’s capital and the calculation of  her capital should have been revised to produce a lower tariff income (paragraph 28);
6.	because of the special structure of state pension credit, where hypothetical quarterly reductions of an overpayment of capital are being made under regulation 14 of the Social Security (Payments on account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988, increases in the actual amount of capital possessed should not be taken into account (paragraph 33).

European Union law – free movement of workers – right of permanent residence pursuant to Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC – whether period of five years completed before 30 April 2006 to be taken into account – effect of absence of less than two years after completion of that period
 The claimant entered the United Kingdom in January 1999 in order to look for work and from September 1999 to February 2005 she was working or seeking work. It was common ground between the parties to the main proceedings that she was a “worker” for the purposes of European Union law from January 1999 to February 2005. In February 2005 she left the United Kingdom to visit her mother in France, where she stayed for ten months. In December 2005, she returned to the United Kingdom where she sought work. From January to November 2006 she received jobseeker’s allowance. In November 2006 she claimed income support on the basis that she was pregnant. That claim was refused on the ground that she had no right to reside in the United Kingdom and was therefore to be treated as not habitually resident and so, as a “person from abroad”, had an applicable amount of nil. Her appeal to an appeal tribunal was allowed on the ground that she had a permanent right of residence under regulation 15 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, which implemented the provisions of Directive 2004/38 in the United Kingdom with effect from 30 April 2006. Article 16 of that Directive provides that European Union citizens who have resided legally for a continuous period of five years in the host Member State shall have a right of permanent residence there. Article 16(4) of the Directive states that the right of permanent residence will be lost only through absence from the host Member State for a period exceeding two consecutive years. The Secretary of State appealed to a Social Security Commissioner and then to the Court of Appeal. It was common ground in those proceedings that, although “right to reside” for the purposes of income support was not expressly defined, the right of permanent residence provided for in Article 16 of Directive 2004/38 constituted a right to reside for those purposes. The Court of Appeal stayed the proceedings and referred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling on the question whether continuous periods of five years’ residence completed before 30 April 2006 must be taken into account for the purposes of the acquisition of the right of permanent residence and, if the answer to that were in the affirmative, whether absences from the host Member State of less than two consecutive years, which occurred before 30 April 2006 but following a continuous period of five years’ legal residence, affected the acquisition of the right of permanent residence pursuant to Article 16(1).
Held, that:
1.	the purpose of  Directive 2004/38 was to facilitate the exercise of the primary and individual right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States that was conferred directly on Union citizens by the Treaty and in particular to strengthen that right, so that Union citizens cannot derive less rights from that Directive than from the instruments of secondary legislation which it amends or repeals: Case C-127/08 Metock and Others [2008] ECR I-6241 cited (paragraphs 30 to 32);
2.	it would be contrary to that purpose to take into account only continuous periods of five years’ legal residence commencing after 30 April 2006 for the purposes of the acquisition of a right of permanent residence, as it would mean that such a right could be granted only from 30 April 2011, and such an interpretation would amount to depriving the residence completed by citizens of the Union in accordance with EU law instruments pre-dating 30 April 2006 of any effect for the purposes of the acquisition of that right of permanent residence (paragraphs 35 and 36);
3.	an interpretation to the effect that only continuous periods of five years’ legal residence ending on 30 April 2006 or thereafter should be taken into account for the purposes of acquisition of the right of permanent residence provided for in Article 16 of Directive 2004/38 was also contrary to the purpose and effectiveness of that Directive. The EU legislature made the acquisition of the right of permanent residence pursuant to Article 16(1) subject to the integration of the citizen of the Union in the host Member State and it would be incompatible with the integration-based reasoning behind Article 16 of that Directive to consider that the required degree of integration in the host Member State depended on whether the continuous period of five years’ residence ended before or after 30 April 2006 (paragraph 37);
4.	the taking into account of periods of residence completed before 30 April 2006 did not give retroactive effect to Article 16 of Directive 2004/38, but simply gave present effect to situations which arose before the date of transposition of that Directive, bearing in mind that the provisions on citizenship of the Union were applicable as soon as they entered into force and therefore they must be applied to the present effects of situations arising previously: Case C-224/98 D’Hoop [2002] ECR I-6191 cited (paragraphs 38 and 39);
5.	consequently, for the purposes of the acquisition of the right of permanent residence provided for in Article 16 of Directive 2004/38, continuous periods of five years’ residence completed before the date of transposition of that Directive, namely 30 April 2006, in accordance with the earlier EU law instruments, must be taken into account (paragraph 40);
6.	it would be contrary to the effectiveness and purpose of Directive 2004/38 and the general scheme and spirit of Article 16 if  Article 16(4) of Directive 2004/38 were not to apply to continuous periods of five years’ legal residence completed before 30 April 2006 and it was clear from the analysis above that Article 16(4) must necessarily apply to those periods and that absences from the host Member State of less than two consecutive years occurring after the five-year periods of continuous residence but before 30 April 2006 were not such as to affect the link of integration of the citizen of the Union concerned (paragraphs 52 to 57);
7.	accordingly, absences from the host Member State of less than two consecutive years which occurred before 30 April 2006 but following a continuous period of five years’ legal residence completed before that date did not affect the acquisition of the right of permanent residence pursuant to Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38 (paragraph 58).

The claimant, a lone parent on income support, lived with her 12 year old son who had Asperger’s Syndrome. The claimant and her son lived for a while with the child’s grandmother in the latter’s three-bedroomed house. The relationship between the claimant and the grandmother was not always harmonious, apparently aggravating the son’s condition. The grandmother moved out, but a purported tenancy of the property to the claimant was torn up when the local authority refused to pay housing benefit. The grandmother then decided to sell her house and the claimant bought a property in a quieter area for herself and her son alone with the aid of a shared ownership mortgage. Her application for help with housing costs was refused under paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 which provides that, where a loan is taken out in a “relevant period” (a period in which the claimant is in receipt of income support or certain other benefits), the housing costs due on that loan will not be met. It was agreed that the loan was taken out during a “relevant period” and the decision-maker held that none of the exceptions to the rule applied. The claimant argued that the case should be excepted because the new property was better suited as it enabled her disabled son to have his own room as well as allowing his grandmother to share care of him. A different decision-maker considered paragraph 4(9) but held that it did not apply as the claimant had not explained how the “physical structure of the property is suited to the nature of the disability”. On appeal the tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State’s decision that the case did not fall within the “disabled person” exception, ruling that the claimant’s purchase was motivated by the grandmother’s desire to sell the house and that the bedrooms in that house could have been more reasonably allocated. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, submitting that the tribunal applied the wrong legal test in applying paragraph 4(9). 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in the proper application of paragraph 4(9), as stated in CIS/3382/2006, “there must be a measure of flexibility and factual judgment in whether a particular loan or property meets that description” (paragraph 40);
2.	the fact that the new accommodation is more suited to the special needs of the disabled person need be only one of the reasons rather than the sole or predominant reason for its acquisition (CIS/14551/1996 followed) (paragraphs 41 and 42);
3.	also following CIS/14551/1996, the tribunal erred in law in applying an overriding test of reasonableness to the determination of the paragraph 4(9) question when the proper statutory question should have been whether the new property was “more suited” to the son’s needs, comparing the old and new accommodation (paragraph 43 and 44).
The Commissioner set aside the tribunal’s decision and referred the case to a differently constituted tribunal with directions.

European Union law – right to reside – whether condition contrary to Article 3 Regulation (EEC) 1408/71
The claimant, who was born in Latvia in 1938, came to the United Kingdom in 2000 before Latvia joined the European Union. Her claim to asylum was refused in January 2004, but no steps were taken to remove her from the United Kingdom. On 1 May 2004 Latvia joined the European Union, so pursuant to derogations from Article 39(3) of the EC Treaty she became entitled to work in the United Kingdom if she complied with the Workers Registration Scheme in the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004. She had worked for about 40 years in Latvia and was in receipt of a retirement pension from the Latvian social security authorities, but she had not worked at any time in the United Kingdom and had no other income. In August 2005 she claimed state pension credit. Her claim was refused on the ground that she lacked a right to reside in the United Kingdom. Regulation 2 of the State Pension Credit Regulations provides that a person is to be treated as not in Great Britain if he is not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland. As amended from 2004, Regulation 2 further provides that no person shall be treated as habitually resident in those territories if he does not have a right to reside in one of them. The claimant appealed, asserting direct discrimination on grounds of her nationality contrary to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71. Her case was that it was her Latvian nationality that precluded the entitlement to state pension credit which she would have had if she had been a United Kingdom national. The appeal tribunal allowed her appeal on the grounds of direct discrimination, but the Secretary of State’s appeal against that decision was allowed by a Social Security Commissioner. He held that the imposition of the right to reside test was indirect discrimination, but that it was justified as a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of protecting the public finances of the host Member State. The Court of Appeal dismissed the claimant’s appeal against the decision of the Commissioner ([2009] EWCA Civ 621) and the claimant appealed to the Supreme Court. It was conceded for the purposes of these proceedings that the claimant fell within the personal scope of Regulation 1408/71 as an “employed person” as defined by Article 1(a), and also that state pension credit fell within the material scope of the Regulation because it was among the special non-contributory benefits listed in Annex IIa.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the test of presence “in Great Britain” was constructed in a way that was more likely to be satisfied by a United Kingdom national than by a national of another Member State, but the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-73/08 Bressol v Gouvernement de la Communauté Française [2010] 3 CMLR 20 required the court to find that that was not directly discriminatory on grounds of nationality (although the Court of Justice had not explained why it did not accept the opinion of the Advocate General on that point), but that it was indirectly discriminatory as it put nationals of other Member States at a particular disadvantage. As such, to be lawful, it had to be justified on objective considerations independent of nationality (paragraphs 30 to 35, 73. 89 to 92, 109);
2.	the Secretary of State’s purpose was to protect the resources of the United Kingdom against exploitation of welfare benefits and social tourism by persons who were not economically or socially integrated with the United Kingdom and that was a legitimate aim according to the principle laid down in Case C-456/02 Trojani v Centre Public d’Aide Sociale de Bruxelles [2004] ELR I-7573; [2004] 3 CMLR 38, and was independent of the nationality of the person concerned, since, while a person’s nationality has a bearing on whether that test can be satisfied, the justification itself is blind to the person’s nationality. The parties were agreed that the provisions were proportionate to the aim. The Secretary of State had therefore provided a sufficient justification (paragraphs 47 to 53, 105 to 108, 109);
3.	the provision for Irish citizens in regulation 2 did not undermine the policy justification for treating the other Member States differently as for economic, historical and social reasons Ireland is different from the other Member States. The provision was protected by Article 2 of the Protocol on the Common Travel Area as an arrangement between the two states relating to the movement of persons between their territories (paragraphs 54 to 61, 80, 109); 
4.	(per Lord Walker, dissenting) the provisions of regulation 2(2) discriminate against economically inactive foreign nationals on the grounds of nationality, whether or not that was the intention of those who framed them, and even though classified as indirect discrimination, the difference of treatment is not capable of justification because, while every British national passed the test automatically, non-nationals would not pass it unless they came within the special categories in regulation 2(1) and so the proposed justification, once examined, was founded on nationality (paragraphs 74 to 81).

The claimant was a self-employed earner in receipt of council tax benefit. In July 2006, following enquiries into his circumstances, the local authority suspended payment of council tax benefit under regulation 13 of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 (the 2001 Regulations) and in August 2006 requested that he provide certain information including his profit and loss accounts for 2005/06. The claimant was given a calendar month from the date of the letter to reply and was told that failure to reply would result in termination of benefit under regulation 14 of the 2001 Regulations. The claimant stated that he did not yet have from his accountant the profit and loss account for 2005/06, but the authority terminated his entitlement. He appealed and an appeal tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that the information had been reasonably required in accordance with regulation 72(1) of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations). The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, arguing that he had, within the time limit, provided all the information that the local authority had requested which was in his possession, and that that information was sufficient to allow the authority to determine his entitlement to council tax benefit. The local authority argued that the fact that a profit and loss account for 2005/06 may not have existed at the time of the information request did not affect matters as the claimant could have provided the information which it was, in substance, seeking which was the figures for trading income and expenditure for 2005/06.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in order to decide whether the claimant had failed to comply within the appropriate time limit, it was necessary for the tribunal to identify the “information requirement” formulated by the local authority and in failing to do that it had erred in law (paragraph 31);
2.	it would have been reasonable for the authority to request information in terms of the information it needed, which was his “net profit” for the assessment period, either initially or when it became clear that the document it had requested did not exist, but there is no evidence that it did so (paragraphs 36 to 40);
3.	the authority had not complied with its duty to notify the claimant of the requirements set out in regulation 13(4) which include provision for a claimant to satisfy the authority that the information or evidence does not exist and the tribunal had erred in failing to consider that question (paragraph 41);
4.	if a document which is the subject of an information requirement does not exist at the time that the information requirement is notified to the claimant an omission to produce it is not a “failure” for the purposes of regulation 14 of the 2001 Regulations (paragraph 42).

The claimant disputed a decision by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that he did not satisfy the contribution conditions for his claim for incapacity benefit. The initial dispute was about a mistake by his employers but in the course of the proceedings an issue was raised about the application of the Social Security (Earnings Factor) Regulations 1979 (the 1979 Regulations). Before the Commissioner it was agreed between the Secretary of State and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) that the tribunal had erred as to which decisions were social security decisions and which were tax decisions. The Commissioner in his decision set out the correct way to handle a dispute about the application of the 1979 Regulations to a claim for incapacity benefit.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it is for the National Insurance Contributions Office of HMRC to decide any question about the contribution record of a claimant for incapacity benefit (paragraph 7(a));
2.	any challenge to that decision on either an issue of fact or a question of law goes to a tax tribunal  , not a social security tribunal  . If an appeal involving a question about a claimant’s contributions comes before a social security tribunal, then the social security tribunal must apply regulation 38A of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. This requires it to adjourn the appeal and refer the matter to the Secretary of State for onward reference to HMRC for decision. The tribunal may decide the appeal only after a decision has been received from HMRC (paragraph 7(b));
3.	it is for the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to decide any question about the interpretation and application of the 1979 Regulations to the individual contribution record of any claimant for incapacity benefit (paragraph 7(c));
4.	if a claimant disputes the decision of the Secretary of State on any issue of fact or law arising under the 1979 Regulations, then that dispute is to be decided by a social security tribunal. This includes any dispute about calculating the earnings factor attributable to a claimant under those regulations. If necessary, it is the task of the tribunal itself to check any disputed calculations (paragraph 7(d)).
The Commissioner referred the matter back to the Secretary of State to consider the appellant’s claim in the light of his decision.

The appellant was a Turkish national who was granted temporary admission to the United Kingdom under paragraph 21 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. In April 2006 she claimed housing benefit. She was still an asylum seeker. Her claim for housing benefit was rejected on the ground that she had no right to reside in the United Kingdom, and was therefore a person from abroad who was to be treated as not liable to make payments in respect of her home by virtue of regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. The claimant’s appeal to an appeal tribunal was allowed on the ground that regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations was irrelevant because the claimant was not excluded from benefit by section 115 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 as she was a national of a state which had ratified the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance (ECSMA) and therefore fell within the exception in paragraph 4 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Social Security (Immigration and Asylum) Consequential Amendments Regulations 2000. The local authority appealed. The Commissioner allowed the appeal, holding that regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations did apply to those not excluded from entitlement to benefits by section 115 of the 1999 Act, and that, as an asylum seeker granted temporary admission, the claimant had a right to be present in the United Kingdom but did not have a right to reside there. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was argued for the claimant that it followed from the inclusion of nationals of ECSMA countries in Part 1 of the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, with categories of persons accepted as having the right to reside, that such nationals also had a right to reside. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there is a clear distinction between lawful presence on the one hand and a right to reside, or ordinary residence or lawful residence, on the other and careful analysis of the appropriate instrument is required to decide whether an applicant has acquired the right to reside (Abdirahman v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2007] EWCA Civ 657, [2008] 1 WLR 254 (also reported as R(IS) 8/07) and R (YA) v Secretary of State for Health [2009] EWCA Civ 225 followed) (paragraph 29);
2.	the list in regulation 10(3B) of categories of persons who are not “persons from abroad” is, and was intended to be, a comprehensive list and the inclusion of paragraph 4 in Part 1 to the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations, whatever its purpose, did not carry for ECSMA nationals the implication of entitlement to a right to reside (paragraphs 31 to 32);
3.	having regard to the authorities, specific provision would be required if a person with the appellant’s characteristics were to be held to have a right to reside and the Commissioner’s reasoning and conclusions were correct (paragraph 33).


Note: The Commissioner's decisioin was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 20.05.09 under the name Yesiloz v London Borough Camden and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2009] EWCA Civ 415 (to be reported as R(H) 7/09).

The claimant’s late husband went to live in Canada in 1976 and his category A retirement pension and graduated retirement benefit (GRB) were frozen at the November 1975 rate in accordance with the provisions of regulations 4 and 5 of the Social Security (Persons Abroad) Regulations 1975 (the Persons Abroad Regulations). Those provisions create exceptions to the general disqualification when absent from Great Britain in section 113 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 in relation to, inter alia, retirement pension and GRB but (by regulation 5(3)) retain the disqualification for increases in the rate of benefit. The claimant married her husband in September 2001. She was a Canadian citizen and had never lived in the United Kingdom.  She was then awarded a Category B retirement pension as his spouse, based on his contributions, also frozen at the 1975 rate under regulation 5(3)(aa). Her husband died on 27 May 2002 and she was then awarded a higher weekly rate of Category B pension in her own right, together with the equivalent of half his GRB, based on November 1975 rates. The claimant appealed to the appeal tribunal, arguing discrimination under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The same point was under consideration in R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions), which was decided by the House of Lords in favour of the Secretary of State in May 2005 ([2005] UKHL 37, [2006] 1 AC 173). The tribunal dismissed her appeal and she appealed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner allowed her appeal, basing his reasoning purely on the construction of regulation 5 of the Persons Abroad Regulations and holding that she was disqualified only in respect of any up-rating order since she first became entitled to a pension in her own right, as the provisions of the Persons Abroad Regulations must be considered week by week, and from 27 May 2002 the claimant ceased to fall within regulation 5(3)(aa) relating to married women, and (b) (relating to widows and widowers) did not apply to past up-rating orders. Therefore, the disqualification from up-rating had to be considered under (c) as from that date. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that, once the extent of disqualification was decided in relation to each up-rating order, the position was then fixed in relation to that up-rating order, even though the benefit is calculated and paid on a weekly basis.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while the Commissioner’s interpretation had force on a strict reading of the wording of the regulation, there was a strong incentive to read any ambiguity in the regulations so as to accord with the evident policy intention in section 113 to deprive those absent from the country from any entitlement to the benefits covered, but to restore it only to the extent that Regulations provided (paragraph 37);
2.	the insertion of sub-paragraph (aa) into regulation 5(3) to deal with a particular problem, without sufficient regard to its relationship to the paragraph as a whole should not be allowed to disrupt the scheme of the paragraph, which is that disqualification from the benefit of up-rating is generally treated as applying for the whole of the period of the order, based on the position at the appointed date and in this context the ordinary “week by week” approach is displaced (paragraph 38);
3.	therefore sub-paragraph (aa) provided the means of establishing the claimant’s status under the current and previous up-rating orders and there was no reason to revisit the basis of her disqualification under the Persons Abroad Regulations (paragraph 39 and 40).
The Court of Appeal remitted the case to the Upper Tribunal so that the matter could be reviewed in the light of the final decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Carson.

In April 2005 an entitlement decision was made, superseding the decision awarding the claimant income support on the ground that he had capital in excess of £8,000. In July 2005 a second decision was made, determining that as a result of the entitlement decision income support had been overpaid and was recoverable because the claimant had failed to disclose the fact that he had capital in excess of £8,000. In November 2005 a tribunal dismissed the claimant’s appeal against the entitlement decision. In March 2006 the claimant appealed against the overpayment decision and, on the direction of a district chairman, the appeal was heard by the chairman who had heard the appeal against the entitlement decision. The claimant challenged the overpayment decision solely on the ground that the entitlement decision had been wrong. The chairman considered that he was bound by his earlier decision on the entitlement issue, but in case he was wrong in that view he conducted a full rehearing of the claimant’s case. That appeal was also dismissed. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was common ground that (following CIS/1330/2002) the findings of fact in the entitlement decision appeal were not binding in the overpayment decision appeal. The only issue for the Commissioner was therefore whether it was unfair for the same chairman to conduct both hearings.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	(following AMEC Capital Projects Limited v Whitefriars City Estates Limited [2004] EWCA Civ 1418, [2005] 1 All ER 723) the mere fact that the tribunal has previously decided the issue is not of itself sufficient to justify a conclusion of apparent bias provided the tribunal approaches the matter with an open mind and gives such reconsideration of the matter as is reasonably necessary for it to be satisfied that its first decision was correct (paragraph 13);
2.	in this case the chairman had gone further than was required by AMEC in conducting a complete rehearing of the case and giving reasons for his decision which were based entirely on the evidence given at the second hearing, and there was nothing in the record of proceedings or the claimant’s account of the hearing which would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to doubt the chairman’s impartiality and objectivity (paragraph 14).

Human rights – whether treatment of parent not in receipt of child benefit as non-resident parent in breach of Article 14 of the Convention
The parents shared the care of their two children equally. The mother applied for child support and on the basis of the shared care arrangements the Secretary of State decided that the mother was the parent with care and that the father was liable to pay child support. The father appealed and the tribunal confirmed the decision of the Secretary of State, observing that it attached no significance to the fact that the child benefit was paid to the mother and that either parent could have been treated as the parent with care. The father appealed to the Commissioner, contending that, in treating him as the non-resident parent and the mother as the person with care, the regulations operated in an unfair and discriminatory way and that there must be some room for discretion. 
Held, allowing the appeal but substituting his own decision to the same effect, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in not applying regulation 8(2)(b)(i) of the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 which states that, where both parents provide care to the same extent, the parent who is not in receipt of child benefit is to be treated as the non-resident parent (paragraph 15);
2.	the rule in that regulation was not irrational or ultra vires (R(CS) 14/98 followed) and there was no basis for suggesting that it breached any provision of European Union Law: neither the child support scheme nor the child benefit scheme was within the scope of council Directive 79/7/EEC (paragraph 16 to 19);
3.	even if the rights of parents in connection with the child support scheme came within Article 8, there was no breach of Article 14 in the present case since the child benefit arrangements between the parents were voluntary and therefore any theoretical possibility of gender-based discrimination within the child benefit scheme did not apply to them (paragraphs 24 to 28).

In each case, the appeal was made to the tribunal after the primary one-month time limit for appealing, but before (or arguably before) the expiry of the absolute statutory bar 12 months later. In those circumstances, under regulation 32 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, a legally qualified panel member (LQPM) has power to extend time for appealing, but, in each of these cases, the LQPM refused to exercise that discretionary power in the claimant’s favour. The issue for the Tribunal of Commissioners was whether such a refusal was a “decision of an appeal tribunal under section 12” for the purposes of section 14 the Social Security Act 1998, ie whether such a decision attracted a right of appeal to a Commissioner or whether the right of challenge was limited to judicial review. In Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Morina and Another [2007] EWCA Civ 749, [2007] 1 WLR 3033 (also reported as R(IS) 6/07) the Court of Appeal had held that that right of appeal did not extend to a challenge to a decision of a LQPM to refuse an extension of time for appealing where the appeal to the tribunal was more than 12 months outside the primary time limit of one month, in which circumstances there was no power in the LQPM to give an extension of time because of the express statutory bar. The difference in these cases was that the LQPM had a discretion to extend the time limit.
Held, dismissing the appeal in CHR/3855/2005 and refusing the applications in CIS/3746/2006 CDLA/948/2007, that:
1.	in Morina Maurice Kay LJ had commented that it was neither desirable nor necessary to import the reasoning of Rickards v Rickards [1990] Fam 194 into the field of social security and Bland v Chief Supplementary Benefit Officer [1983] 1 WLR 262 (also reported as R(SB) 12/83) and White v Chief Adjudication Officer [1986] 2 All ER 905 (also reported as an appendix to R(S) 8/85) remained  authority for the proposition that some interlocutory decisions were not “decisions” for the purposes of section 14(1) of the 1998 Act, because they did not determine the matter in dispute. There was no suggestion in the reasoning that Maurice Kay LJ’s comments were limited to the facts of Morina (paragraphs 28 to 32);
2.	the reasoning of Arden LJ and the Master of the Rolls in Morina, based solely on statutory construction, did not support the claimants in the present case because an approach based purely on statutory construction inevitably requires that all decisions taken under regulation 32 are characterised in the same way for the purposes of section 14(1) of the 1998 Act and the decision of the Court of Appeal was binding so far as the proper statutory construction of the relevant statutory provisions was concerned (paragraphs 35 and 36);
3.	insofar as the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in Morina was not binding because the case before it concerned an unencumbered appellate exclusion, the comments made in that case were, in the Commissioners’ view, correct (paragraph 36).

The claimant made an application for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom as her daughter’s dependant under Immigration Rule 317, supported by a sponsorship undertaking given by her daughter in which she undertook to be responsible for the claimant’s maintenance and accommodation. The application was refused because the claimant did not satisfy the conditions for the grant of leave under that Rule, but she was later, on compassionate grounds, granted indefinite leave to remain outside the immigration rules. She was initially awarded pension credit but the decision was subsequently revised on the basis that it had been made in ignorance of a material fact, ie the existence of the maintenance undertaking. The claimant appealed, arguing that the revision decision had been made in the belief that she was not allowed recourse to public funds, despite there being no express stipulation to that effect. The tribunal upheld the Secretary of State’s submission that the basis of her grant of leave was her daughter’s sponsorship undertaking and that “outside the rules” did not mean that she was not subject to immigration control. The claimant appealed. The issue before the Commissioner was whether she was a person subject to immigration control under section 115(9) of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 because she had been given leave to remain as a result of a maintenance undertaking.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the evidence in this case was insufficient to establish whether the maintenance undertaking had been a factor in the decision to grant the claimant leave to remain, in accordance with the test in CIS/3508/2001, and the causal connection could not be inferred where the decision to grant leave was outside the immigration rules  and so did not depend on conditions as to the provision of accommodation and maintenance by a relative (paragraphs 12 to 15);
2.	it was for the Secretary of State to show that the maintenance undertaking was a factor in the decision to grant leave, not only because the burden of proof was on the Secretary of State to show that a claimant fell within the scope of an exclusion from entitlement (following CIS/1607/2004), but also because, in accordance with the approach of Baroness Hale of Richmond in Kerr v Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL 23, [2004] 1 WLR 1372, (reported as R 1/04 (SF)), it was reasonable to expect the Secretary of State rather than the claimant to investigate what considerations had in fact weighed with the immigration decision-maker in granting the claimant leave to remain (paragraphs 16 to 18);
3.	the Secretary of State had made no attempt to establish the weight given to a sponsorship undertaking in granting leave to remain outside the immigration rules either generally or in this particular case and the issue of whether section 115(9) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 applied to the claimant had therefore to be decided against the Secretary of State and in favour of the claimant (paragraph 19).
The Commissioner on the basis of his own findings of fact substituted a decision that the claimant was not a person subject to immigration control and was therefore entitled to state pension credit.

The claimant was a male-to-female transgender person who attained the female pension age of 60 in 2002, when she was still living as a man. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into effect in April 2005. The claimant had gender reassignment surgery in December 2005 and obtained a full gender recognition certificate in December 2006. She was awarded retirement pension from 25 December 2006. The appeal to the Commissioners was against the refusal by a decision-maker and tribunal of her earlier claim, made in May 2006, asserting entitlement to equal treatment under Article 4(1) of Council Directive 79/7 with a person of the same age born a female, based on the ruling by the European Court of Justice in Case C-423/04 Richards v Secretary of State [2006] ECR I-3585 (now reported as R(P) 1/07) issued on 27 April 2006. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant, as an individual within the personal scope of Article 4(1) of Council Directive 79/7, was in principle entitled to rely on its direct effect to claim a retirement pension on the basis of equal treatment with any other person of her acquired gender, overriding any conditions in the national legislation which otherwise restricted her to less favourable treatment, both before and after the Gender Recognition Act came into force and whether based on events and circumstances before or after it did so (Richards above; and Cases 286/85 McDermott [1987] ECR 1453 and 384/85 Borrie-Clarke v CAO [1987] ECR 2865 followed) (paragraphs 19, 29 to 31); 
2.	such a claim was subject to the normal 12-month limit on arrears of possible entitlement under section 1 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Claims and Payments Regulations, so that the period to be considered on the claim of May 2006 was from May 2005 onwards. That limit was not inconsistent with the claimant’s right to equal treatment under the Directive as it is one of universal application and does not apply in any less favourable way to direct effect claims (Case C-208/90 Emmott v Minister for Social Welfare [1991] I-ECR 4269 distinguished; Case C-410/92 Johnson v CAO (No 2), R(S) 1/95, Secretary of State v Walker-Fox [2005] EWCA Civ 1411, R(IS) 3/06 followed) (paragraphs 21, 33 to 35);
3.	on the facts however that claim did not entitle the claimant to any further pension than she had been awarded from December 2006, because (a) the substantive conditions in the Gender Recognition Act for when a change of gender is to be recognised in law are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Directive and were to be applied in determining whether or when the change of gender was to be recognised for the purposes of her equal treatment claim (paragraphs 36 to 41); and (b) it was only in December 2006 that she first became able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Gender Recognition Panel that she met those conditions (paragraph 43).

Residence and presence conditions – right to reside – dependent family member – whether dependency in country of origin required
The claimant, a Portuguese national, came to the United Kingdom in 2004 to join her son. She initially received jobseeker’s allowance, but on reaching the age of 60, claimed state pension credit. That claim was refused on the ground that she was deemed not to be “in Great Britain” by virtue of regulation 2 of the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002, as she did not have a right to reside in the United Kingdom. The claimant appealed and a tribunal upheld her appeal, finding that she should have been treated as “in Great Britain” under regulation 2(4) as the dependent family member of an EU national who had retained worker status under the terms of the Citizens’ Directive (2004/38/EC). The Secretary of State’s appeal to the Commissioner was allowed. On the claimant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal it was common ground that the claimant was a “family member” as defined by Article 2(2)(d) of the Directive. The issue was whether she was “dependent”. The Secretary of State argued that it was necessary for dependency to have existed at the time of entry to the United Kingdom, citing Jia v Migrationsverket (Case C-1/05) [2007] QB 545, followed in KG (Sri Lanka) and AK (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 13; [2008] Imm AR 343 and Bigia and others v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ 79, and referring to Guidance from the Commission to the European Parliament.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Secretary of State’s interpretation of Articles 2(1) and 3(1) could realistically result in a person deciding not to move to another Member State to work or, having moved, to be encouraged to return to his State of origin, and so would not be consistent with the purpose of the Directive, or give effect to it (Minister voor Vereemdelingenzaken en Integratie v RNG Eind (Case C-291/05) [2007] ECR 1-10719 and Metock and Others v Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Case C-127/08) [2009] QB 318; [2008] ECR 1-06241 followed) (paragraphs 58 to 60);
2.	when in Jia the court referred  to the need for material support having to exist in the State of origin, it did so on the basis of what was said in Article 4(3)(e) of Directive 68/360, but Article 8(5)(d) of the Citizens’ Directive says nothing to suggest that documentary evidence of an Article 2(2)(d) dependency need emanate from the State of origin, in specific contrast to “other family member cases” under Article 3(2)(a), where under Article 8(5)(e) the relevant authority of the country of origin is referred to, and so the basis of the decision in Jia, insofar as it concerns family members, falls away in a case involving the Citizens’ Directive (paragraph 63);
3.	Article 2(2), by contrast with Article 3(2)(a), does not specify when the dependency has to have arisen nor does it require that the relative must be dependent in the country of origin and so Article 2(2)(d), together with Article 8(5)(d), suggests that dependency in the State of origin need not be proved for family members. Such an interpretation reflects the policy of the Directive to strengthen and simplify the realisation of realistic free movement rights of Union citizens compatibly with their family rights (paragraph 67);
4.	it followed that the proof of dependence by Mrs Pedro on her son in the United Kingdom, accepted by the appeal tribunal, would suffice under Article 2(2)(d) and that the guidance promulgated by the European Commission was incorrect, at least insofar as it concerned facts such as the present (paragraphs 69 to 72).

(Paragraphs 1 to 30 and 226 to 267 only are reproduced.)
The four claimants were tenants of Golden Lane Housing Limited (GLH), who provided accommodation for people with learning disabilities throughout the country. They were in receipt of housing benefit. Following the introduction of the Supporting People programme in 2003, the local authority restricted the eligible rent to the local reference rent, determined by a rent officer, applying the version of regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 in force since 2 January 1996. The claimants argued on appeal that their accommodation was exempt by virtue of the saving provision in regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1995. Regulation 10(6), as amended in 1999, defines exempt accommodation as including accommodation provided by certain bodies where the landlord or a person acting on its behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. (Equivalent provisions, referred to in paragraph 4 of the decision, are contained in the consolidating legislation which took effect from 6 March 2006.) Since April 2003 care support and supervision had been provided by third parties commissioned directly by the local authority. The Commissioner had by interim decisions previously set aside the appeal tribunals’ decisions and reheard the evidence for the propose of making decisions in substitution for those made by the appeal tribunals.
Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	the making available of certain types of support is capable of amounting to the provision of support to a tenant during a particular period, even if that tenant has no need of it during that period, but in determining whether a service or facility amounts to the provision of support to any particular tenant to a more than minimal extent, one must have regard to the degree of likelihood that the particular tenant will ever need to take advantage of it (paragraphs 21 to 24);
2.	further, the service or facility which is made available must be one which can and may realistically be called upon at any time. On the facts of these cases GLH did not provide support by being ready and willing (i) to intervene in the event of something going badly wrong with the support being provided by the main support provider (paragraphs 230) or (ii) to assist the tenant with finding new accommodation should he decide to move (paragraph 261);
3.	the provision of “support” involves the landlord doing something more than or different from the exercise of its ordinary property management functions (paragraph 25);
4.	the words “provides … support” imply a degree of continuity in the available support. They therefore do not include assistance given by the landlord in connection with the tenant’s move to the property (paragraphs 26 and 261);
5.	the word “support” connotes the giving of advice and assistance to the claimant in coping with the practicalities of everyday life, and does not extend to scrutinising the arrangements for the provision by some other body of care, support and supervision, with a view to remedying defects or to recommending improvements (paragraph 232);
6.	in relation to the each of the categories of support said by GLH to have been provided, either GLH did not at the material times provide support, or did not do so to more than a minimal extent, and the aggregate of the support provided was not more than minimal (paragraphs 265 to 267).

Right to reside – whether a residence permit confers a right of residence – whether five years’ residence as a worker before 30 April 2006 confers a right of permanent residence under Article 18(1) of the EC Treaty
The claimant came to the United Kingdom and worked continuously from January 1998 until the summer of 2002. On 13 May 2000 the Home Office issued the claimant with a residence permit as provided for in Article 4 of Directive 68/360/EEC. The permit included a statement that her stay in the United Kingdom was limited from 13 May 2000 to 13 May 2005 unless she obtained subsequent leave before the expiry of the permit. In the summer of 2002 the claimant went on maternity leave. From 18 April 2003 until 25 April 2004 she did not work. On 26 April 2004 the claimant returned to work and continued in employment until 23 March 2007. In March 2007 she claimed income support. The claim was disallowed by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the ground that the claimant had no right of residence in the United Kingdom because she had ceased to be a worker and had not completed five years’ continuous residence so as to have a right of permanent residence under Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC. On appeal, the claimant was awarded income support on the ground that she had remained a worker from 18 April 2003 to 25 April 2004. On the Secretary of State’s appeal, the Social Security Commissioner held the appeal tribunal to have erred but decided that the claimant’s residence from 18 April 2003 to 25 April 2004 could be treated as a valid period of residence for the purposes of the right of permanent residence under Article 16(1) both because she had a residence permit during that period and because she had previously completed five years’ continuous residence as a worker and so had a right of residence under Article 18 of the European Community Treaty. The Secretary of State appealed against the Commissioner’s decision and the claimant cross-appealed. The Court of Appeal [2009] EWCA Civ 807 decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following two questions to the European Court for a preliminary ruling: (1) can a European Union citizen acquire a permanent right of residence under Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38 by being present in a Member State under a valid residence permit despite being voluntarily unemployed for a period; and (2) does five years’ continuous residence as a worker prior to 30 April 2006 give rise to a permanent right of residence under Article 18(1) of the Treaty if it does not give rise to a permanent right of residence under Article 16(1) of the Directive.
Held, that:
1.	it follows from Case C-408/03 Commission v Belgium [2006] ECR I-2647 that the grant of a residence permit to a national of a Member State is a declaratory measure serving to prove the individual position of a national of another Member State and is not a declaration of rights and, accordingly, periods of residence completed before 30 April 2006 solely on the basis of a residence permit validly issued, but without the conditions governing entitlement to any right of residence having been met, cannot be regarded as having been completed legally for the purposes of the acquisition of a right of permanent residence under Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38 (paragraphs 42 to 57);
2.	the Court has held that absences of less than two consecutive years from the host Member State after five years’ continuous legal residence do not affect the integration of the citizen concerned and so, by analogy, periods of residence of less than two consecutive years completed solely on the basis of a residence permit validly issued, but without the conditions governing entitlement to a right of residence having been satisfied, and after a continuous period of five years’ legal residence completed prior to 30 April 2006, are not such as to affect the acquisition of the right of permanent residence under Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38 (paragraphs 58 to 66).

The claimant cared for his wife, who was severely disabled and in receipt of a local authority direct payment under section 57(1) of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, disregarded as income under paragraph 58 of Schedule 9 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (the 1987 Regulations). The direct payments were made to the claimant’s wife on the footing that she would use them to purchase care services to be provided by the claimant. The decision-maker decided that the payments made by the wife to the claimant fell to be taken into account as income for income support purposes. The claimant appealed and the tribunal reversed the decision on the ground that the claimant could not be regarded as an employee of his wife and therefore could not be treated as being in receipt of “earnings”. On the Secretary of State’s appeal, the claimant’s representative argued that, because section 136(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provides for the aggregation of the resources of husband and wife, the (disregarded) direct payments paid by the local authority to the wife must be treated as having been paid to the claimant and there was therefore no possibility of treating him as having received them for a second time in the form of earnings. The Commissioner set aside the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the decision-maker’s decision on the grounds that the only possible inference on the facts was that the claimant was engaged by his wife to provide care services for reward; section 136(1) did not prevent those earnings from being included in his income because regulation 23(1) of the 1987 Regulations meant that, because the direct payments were required to be disregarded in computing his wife’s income, they were not treated as his income by section 136. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that a transfer of funds within the family should not be treated as earnings of the recipient.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	in the absence of statutory definitions of “income” or “earnings” those terms were to be given their ordinary and natural meaning as payment by one to another, and the making by a claimant, where authorised by the responsible authority, of a community care direct payment to a spouse or other close relative to secure care services does not render it any the less earnings in the relative’s hands so as to bring it within the notion of the family income for the purpose of the section 57 regime or that of section 136(1) of the 1992 Act (paragraph 25);
2.	it was consistent with the scheme and policy of the income support legislation that the direct payment made to the wife was disregarded as family income for assessing the claimant’s income support but that in his hands it became earnings which must be taken into account under section 136(1) (paragraphs 26 to 30).

The claimant took out a loan to purchase the 60 per cent beneficial interest in the house in which he lived which had been left to his brothers under his mother’s will. His entitlement to income support had ended on 16 Feb 2006 and the loan was advanced on 9 May 2006. He reclaimed income support on 11 May 2006 when he satisfied the conditions of entitlement except that, unless interest on the mortgage could be added to his “applicable amount”, his income was too high. The issue in the appeal was whether the claimant’s loan was prevented from qualifying for income support housing costs by paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 on the ground that the loan was issued during a period “falling between two … periods of entitlement to income support separated by not more than 26 weeks”. The decision-maker decided that it was and the tribunal dismissed the claimant’s appeal. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	for the purposes of any claim, a period covered by that claim during which the claimant would have been entitled to income support if the loan had qualified for housing costs must be treated as being a period of entitlement (paragraph 14);

[2010] EWCA Civ 162

",SSWP,"Reported as [2010] AACR 28.
Income – early retirement pension taken under the NHS Pension Scheme following a personal injury – whether to be disregarded for income support purposes 
The claimant suffered a neck injury, which eventually led to his early retirement on medical grounds. The injury was attributable to his employment with the National Health Service and he was paid an early retirement pension on the ground of ill health under the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/300). He argued that the pension payments fell to be disregarded for income support purposes as “relevant payments” under paragraph 15(1) of Schedule 9 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as they fell within the definition in paragraph 15(5A)(e) as payments “received by virtue of any agreement or court order to make payments to the claimant in consequence of any personal injury to the claimant”. A Deputy Social Security Commissioner concluded that the payments were not made as a form of compensation for personal injury. She regarded sub-paragraph (e) as relating to sums paid as a result of a court order or an agreed settlement, where there was a liability to make the payment as a consequence of personal injury, and not to pension payments. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. He argued that the payments fell within the words “received by virtue of any agreement” in the sub-paragraph because he had a contract of employment with the National Health Service and it was under that agreement that he was entitled to the pension for early retirement.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
the “agreement” in paragraph 15(5A)(e) must be one which is made “in consequence of” the personal injury and therefore the payments to the appellant were not to be disregarded under Schedule 9 for income support purposes.

Capital – whether property purchased in France in the claimant’s name was held on trust for the person who provided the purchase money
The claimant was the registered owner of a house and adjoining land in France. He was receiving income support but did not disclose to the Department for Work and Pensions the existence of the property or the fact that it was in his name. After those facts came to light, he admitted that the property was in his name, but said that the beneficial owner was a Ms V, with whom he was living in England (but not as husband and wife). Ms V had provided the purchase price and the costs of its renovation, but the property had been put in the claimant’s name and he had bequeathed the usufruct to her under French law, to secure the succession to the property under French law of their son rather than Ms V’s adult children. The decision-maker decided that the property was the claimant’s capital for the purposes of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 and so he was not entitled to income support and there had been a recoverable overpayment. His appeal to an appeal tribunal was dismissed and he appealed to the Commissioner. The claimant argued that the applicable law was English law, under which he held the property on an implied trust for Ms V, and that the property was therefore not his capital. The Secretary of State responded that the applicable law was French law, under which there was no implied trust of the property, so that the claimant owned it absolutely. The Commissioner held that French law was the applicable law for determining the existence of the putative implied trust, and, on the basis of expert evidence, that French law gave Ms V no proprietary interest in the property. The claimant applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal. Permission was granted on all the grounds, save for the claimant’s challenge to the Commissioner’s findings of French law.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	 the Commissioner was entitled, on the facts found by him and on a proper understanding of common law principles, to conclude that French law was the applicable law, as France was the country with which the parties’ arrangements had the closest connection (Webb v Webb [1991] 1 WLR 1410 and Lightning v Lightning Electrical Contractors Ltd CA 23 April 1998 distinguished) (paragraphs  29 to 34);
2.	the same result would follow from the application of Article 7 of the Hague Convention and the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 to ascertain the system of law with which the arrangement had the closest connection (paragraph 35);
3.	in those circumstances there was no need to consider what would be the position about the terms of an implied trust of the property, if English law were applicable (paragraph 36);
4.	in the light of the expert evidence the Commissioner had made a properly informed decision on French law which could not possibly be said to be perverse or plainly wrong and no important point of principle or practice arose which would justify the grant of permission for a second appeal (paragraph 37 to 42).

The Secretary of State refused to supersede (by way of variation on the grounds of inconsistent lifestyle) the maintenance order in effect against the father. The mother appealed and a tribunal allowed her appeal. The father appealed to the Commissioner. Section 28F(3) of the Child Support Act 1991 provides that the Secretary of State shall not agree to a variation if he is satisfied that prescribed circumstances apply, including, by regulation 7(5)(b) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000, where the non-resident parent is in receipt of working tax credit. The question for the Commissioner was whether he had to be “properly” or “lawfully” in receipt of the tax credit. In Department for Social Development v MacGeagh [2005] NICA 28 (reported as R 2/05 (CS)) the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland had considered a very similar issue and decided that “in payment” did not mean “lawfully in payment”.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while the Commissioner was not strictly bound to follow the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, that court had referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in England and Wales in Secretary of State for Social Security and another v Harmon, Carter and Cocks [1999] 1WLR 163 (R/CS 4/99) which reached a similar conclusion in relation to the meaning of words in section 6 of the 1991 Act  (paragraph 10);
2.	the case of R v South Ribble Borough Council ex parte Hamilton (2001) 33 HLR 9, where it was held that legislation should not be construed so as to enable a person to profit from his or her own fraud, was to be distinguished on the basis that it dealt with known fraud (R(CS) 3/08 followed) (paragraphs 11 and 12);
3.	it followed that, unless there has actually been a criminal conviction (or, possibly, an admission of fraud during the course of tribunal or court proceedings), the position in Harmon (and MacGeagh) continued to apply (paragraph 13).

Housing and council tax benefit – whether “gross income” means incapacity benefit actually received after reduction by virtue of section 30DD of the SSCBA 1992 or the notional full rate
The claimant was in receipt of an occupational pension and incapacity benefit reduced from the full rate to take into account the occupational pension in accordance with section 30DD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (the 1992 Act). In dealing with his claim for council tax benefit the local authority had taken into account the amount of incapacity benefit actually paid, but on 22 May 2007 reassessed his entitlement back to April 2004 using the standard rate of incapacity benefit payable rather than the actual amount paid to the claimant following the section 30DD reduction, relying on regulation 30(5) of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations which provides that “where payment of any benefit … is subject to any deduction by way of recovery the amount to be taken into account … shall be the gross amount payable”. The claimant appealed to a tribunal which agreed with the local authority’s interpretation of the regulation and upheld the decision. A District Chairman granted the claimant leave to appeal to a Commissioner. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 30(5) did not apply on the facts of the case. The claimant’s incapacity benefit was not “subject to any deduction by way of recovery” but subject to a reduction by virtue of the operation of section 30DD of the 1992 Act: no amount was being “recovered” from his benefit entitlement (paragraph 16);
2.	the correct approach was to assess the claimant’s income based on (a) his gross occupational pension payments (see R(IB) 3/05), (b) the actual rate of incapacity benefit in payment after any reduction under section 30DD and (c) any other relevant income.
The Deputy Commissioner set aside the decision of the tribunal, substituted his own decision as above and directed the local authority to recalculate the claimant’s entitlement accordingly.

The claimant appealed and an appeal tribunal upheld the Secretary of State’s decision, finding that the movements involved in the claimant’s work did not involve the required degree of dorsiflexion and palmar flexion and were not the main action of the hand involved in that work. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law in confusing the questions arising on a claim for disablement benefit by considering in the context of the prescription question whether the prescribed movements were the sole or main action involved in the claimant’s work, that being a relevant issue only for the causation question (paragraphs 8 to 16);
2.	the tribunal had also erred in misinterpreting the report of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council as showing that a particular degree of flexion was relevant to the prescription question when there was nothing in the report to suggest that, though the degree of flexion could be relevant to the medical condition question or the causation question (paragraphs 21 to 27).

A tribunal decided that there were reasons to admit outside the normal time limit, and purported to admit the appeal without considering the question of the absolute time limit.

1.	at least in relation to absolute time limits for appeals to the pensions appeal tribunal, a decision wrongly made without jurisdiction at an earlier stage cannot confer jurisdiction on the court deciding the issue at a later stage and to decide otherwise in this case would be to subvert the very clearly expressed intention of Parliament (following CAF/1133/2007 and cases there cited) (paragraph 25);

The claimant was awarded housing benefit from November 2000. For part of the time, housing benefit was paid to the landlord. Following an investigation, the local authority discovered that the claimant and his wife had amounts of capital that together were well over the threshold for an award of either benefit. In May 2006, the local authority decided that the claimant had been overpaid housing benefit in respect of the inclusive period from November 2000 to June 2005. It also decided that overpaid benefit was recoverable from the claimant under section 75 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and regulation 101(2) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. A tribunal dismissed his appeal. The issue for the Upper Tribunal was whether the amendments to the law on recoverability of overpayments of housing benefit that came into force in April 2006 applied to liability in respect of payments made before that date, the difference being that under the former law the claimant and his landlord would, for the period when benefit was paid to the landlord, be jointly and severally liable to repay, whereas under the amended law the claimant would be solely liable. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 101 applies to decisions taken after it came into force and therefore to payments that were made before it came into force, and, since it effected a real change in liability, was retrospective in its terms. Therefore it was necessary to consider whether that retrospective effect was so unfair that it was not permissible to attribute to Parliament the intention that it should so operate (Plewa v Chief Adjudication Officer [1995] 1 AC 249, [1994] 3 WLR 317 followed) (paragraphs 37 to 40);
2.	the presumption against retrospective effect is flexible and how the question of fairness will be answered in respect of a particular statute will depend on the interaction of several factors, each of them capable of varying from case to case (L’Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd [1994] 1 AC 486 followed) (paragraphs 41 to 47); 
3.	the presumption did not apply in this case, since the retrospective effect did not result in any significant change in the ultimate legal position of any person affected (paragraphs 48 to 56);
4.	while section 75 does not authorise retrospective provision expressly, in most circumstances a payment in excess of entitlement inevitably involves a retrospective change to that entitlement and so the provision authorises retrospective provision by necessary and distinct implication (Master Ladies Tailors Organisation v Minister of Labour and National Service [1950] 2 All ER 525 followed) (paragraphs 57 and 58);
5.	in overpayment cases tribunals should use their power to give directions for the production of documents in order to ensure that there is no issue that might affect the overpayment and liability decisions and that the parties are able to participate fully in the proceedings (paragraphs 81 to 85).

Following an application for a maintenance calculation made by the parent with care, the non-resident parent disclosed that, in addition to other income, child tax credit was payable to his partner in respect of her daughter. The amount of child tax credit included a disability premium, and the non-resident parent contended that in those circumstances it should not be included in his assessable income for the purposes of calculating his maintenance liability. That contention was rejected by the decision-maker. The non-resident parent appealed and an appeal tribunal allowed his appeal, on the basis that the words “shall be treated as the income of the non-resident parent” were missing from the reference to child tax credits of a non-resident parent or his partner in paragraph 13A of the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000, whereas they appeared elsewhere in the Schedule. The Secretary of State appealed to the Commissioner. Before the Commissioner it was argued for the non-resident parent that paragraph 13A as worded was meaningless and devoid of effect.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the words “shall be treated as the income of the non-resident parent” had not been accidentally omitted from paragraph 13A but were unnecessary where the whole of such income was to be treated as that of the non-resident parent, since paragraph 1 of the Schedule provides that the net weekly income of the non-resident parent is the aggregate of the net weekly income of that parent “provided for in this Schedule” (paragraph 8);
2.	where the words appear elsewhere in the Schedule that is because the payments covered by those paragraphs are only treated as income of the non-resident parent in certain circumstances or cases (paragraph 8); 
3.	even if the words “shall be treated as the income of the non-resident parent” had been accidentally omitted from paragraph 13A, those words could be implied into the legislation if not to do so would deprive the provision of all meaning (Adler v George [1964] 2 QB 7, [1964] 2 WLR 542 cited) (paragraph 9).

Income – Computation of Earnings Regulations – whether accrued holiday pay “payable in respect of a period” – whether it is “earnings of the same kind” as normal earnings and to be calculated in the same way
The claimant retired on 30 November 2006. His last day of work was 21 November 2006. On 17 November he was paid a final payment consisting of wages and holiday pay (representing pay in lieu of outstanding annual holiday entitlement). He made a claim for carer’s allowance to take effect from 1 December 2006. The Secretary of State allowed the claim from 29 January 2007, but refused it for the period 1 December 2006 to 28 January 2007. An appeal tribunal confirmed the decision of the Secretary of State, holding itself bound by CG/4172/2001 to treat the claimant’s holiday pay as “earnings of the same kind” as payment of ordinary wages for the purposes of regulation 6(2)(a) of the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996, which prescribes that earnings should be calculated over “a period equal to a benefit week or such number of benefit weeks as comprise the period commencing on the date on which earnings are treated as paid … and ending on the day before the date on which earnings of the same kind … would, or would if the employment was continuing, next be treated as paid … .”. On the basis that holiday pay fell within regulation 6(2)(a) and was “earnings of the same kind” as ordinary wages, the claimant’s entitlement to carer’s allowance did not begin until 29 January 2007. The claimant appealed to the Social Security Commissioners, whose functions by the time the appeal was heard had been transferred to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber). The Upper Tribunal confirmed the appeal tribunal’s decision (DC v SSWP [2008] UKUT 23 (AAC)) and the claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was argued on behalf of the claimant that the holiday pay should be attributed to one benefit week on the basis of a disjunctive construction of regulation 6(2)(a) and that the words “earnings of the same kind” had to bear the same meaning as in 6(3) and (4) (dealing with aggregation of periods that would otherwise overlap) where holiday pay is clearly distinguished as being “earnings not of the same kind” as normal earnings.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	in making the 1996 regulations the Secretary of State must be taken to have had regard to the holding in Chief Supplementary Benefit Officer v Cunningham [1985] ICR 660 that holiday pay is payable in respect of a period and so falls within regulation 6(2)(a) and not 6(2)(b) (Lowsley v Forbes [1999] 1 AC 329 (paragraphs 20 to 24, 43 and 44);
2.	 the phrase “of the same kind” in regulation 6(2)(a), though perhaps unnecessary, is intended to distinguish those earnings to which regulation 6(2)(a) applies, in other words, those paid in respect of a period, and those other kinds of earnings to which regulation 6(2)(b) applies and such an interpretation gives meaning to all the words of regulation 6(2)(a) and does not result in the surprising consequences that would result from a disjunctive reading (paragraphs 34 to 36);
3.	in spite of the opacity of the language, regulation 6(2)(a) is a deeming provision which seeks to make relatively simple the assessment of the end date when a periodic payment is made which does not consist of ordinary pay (paragraph 40);
4.	while any statutory scheme should be understood as a whole, that cannot lead to the immutable rule that the same words used in the same legislation necessarily have the same meaning (paragraphs 37 to 39);
5.	(per Wilson LJ) the argument for a disjunctive interpretation of regulation 6(2)(a) ascribes to the word “or” the function of imposing a divorce between the preceding words “a period equal to a benefit week” and the succeeding words “such number of benefit weeks as …” which the grammar cannot sustain (paragraph 45);
6.	(per Wilson LJ) whether earnings are of the same kind and whether they are payable in respect of a period are totally different questions and since no sensible meaning can be given to the phrase “of the same kind” in regulation 6(2)(a) it should be eliminated (Stone v Corporation of Yeovil (1876) 1 CPD 691 followed) (paragraphs 49 and 50).

The claimant, who had a large family, rented two adjacent flats. One was rented from the freehold owner, the other from a tenant. The local authority decided that, regardless of who was the immediate landlord, separate flats could not constitute a single dwelling and refused to award either housing benefit or council tax benefit in respect of the second flat. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, which decided that the two flats were in practical terms one dwelling occupied as the claimant's home. The local authority appealed against the tribunal's decision in respect of housing benefit, but did not pursue the appeal in respect of council tax benefit, because the two flats had been rebanded as a single hereditament for council tax purposes. The local authority argued that a claimant who was occupying two dwellings was only entitled to housing benefit under 7(6)(c) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, and that, as that provision applied only if the local (housing) authority had housed the claimant in separate dwellings, it was impossible for a claimant to qualify for housing benefit if the tenancies were privately arranged.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Miah [2003] EWCA Civ 1111, reported as R(JSA) 9/03, it had been held that “dwelling occupied as the home” could apply to two dwellings in the context of income-based jobseeker’s allowance and although that case was not a binding authority on the interpretation of housing benefit legislation, it was authority that it is permissible in appropriate circumstances to take a  functional approach  (paragraph 22);
2.	“dwelling” is an ordinary word whose general meaning is well understood and therefore its meaning in context is that to be ascribed to the intention of the notional legislator (Moyna v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2003] 1 WLR 1929, also reported as R(DLA) 7/03, followed) (paragraph 29);
3.	housing benefit legislation is concerned with the economic substance of an arrangement rather than with the precise legal form and it was appropriate in that context to take account of the reality of the claimant’s living arrangements and not place too much emphasis on the legal structure (paragraph 31); 
4.	the single question of fact for the tribunal in applying the words “a dwelling in Great Britain which he occupies as his home” was the extent of the dwelling occupied by the claimant, and the tribunal's finding that the claimant’s dwelling consisted of both flats was not perverse (paragraph 34); 
5.	on that finding, no issue arose on regulation 7(6)(c) because the claimant was not occupying separate dwellings (paragraph 35).

Retirement pension – additional pension – whether guaranteed minimum pension to be deducted from total additional pension or only from the additional pension attributable to contracted-out employment
The claimant was a member of an occupational pension scheme that was contracted out from the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. On 31 March 1991 he ceased employment and drew his occupational pension. He was awarded his state retirement pension from 12 May 2002 when he became 65. His total weekly pension was calculated on the basis of a deduction of £40.66 from his pre-April 1997 additional pension entitlement in order to take account of the guaranteed minimum pension attributable to his membership of a contracted-out occupational pension scheme. On his appeal he argued that, if section 46 of the Pensions Schemes Act 1993 required his GMP to be set off against and deducted from his pre-April 1997 additional pension, the extent of the deduction should be limited to that part of the pre-April 1997 additional pension that was attributable to the years in which he was in contracted-out employment. The Upper Tribunal commented that it appeared anomalous that a guaranteed minimum pension derived from a contracted-out pension scheme should be offset against an additional pension derived from earnings factors attributable to contributions or earnings in employment that was not contracted-out but held that to be the effect of a literal construction of section 46 and that, in the absence of any evidence as to intention, the requirement set out in Inco Europe v First Choice Distribution [2000] 1 WLR 586 that a judge must be “abundantly sure” that a specific drafting error had been made before correcting an anomaly was not met. The Upper Tribunal therefore dismissed the appeal (GW v SSWP [2008] UKUT 33 (AAC)). The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal was provided with pre-statutory material relating to section 29 of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975, the predecessor of section 46.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the pre-statutory material gave no basis for contending that the absence of any restriction of the statutory set-off to additional pension accruing in the contracted-out period of employment was due to an error on the part of the draftsman and did not represent the intention of the legislature (paragraph 27);
2.	there is no scope within the legislation for there to be a separation of periods in which a person was not contracted out of SERPS and for additional pension earned in those periods to be taken out of the operation of section 46 and paid without any deduction and if, because of differences in the ways in which the real values of GMP entitlements and of earnings factors were protected, that involves some eating into additional pension earned in contracted-in years, that simply had to be accepted as part of the structure of the scheme (CP/1318/2001 approved) (paragraph 27);
3.	while the effect of amendments to the scheme in 1995 may have been substantially to increase the likelihood of a GMP increasing in value at a greater rate than a prospective additional pension, nothing in the historical material suggested that that was foreseen when either section 29 or section 46 came to be enacted or that Parliament intended to make any special provision to deal with the difficulty (paragraphs 28 and 29).

The claimant was a self-employed carpenter. He had a period of entitlement to jobseeker’s allowance and then he worked from 1 May 2007 to 8 May 2007. He claimed jobseeker’s allowance again on 9 July 2007. His claim was disallowed on the ground that he was in remunerative work and therefore not entitled by virtue of section 1(2)(e) of the Jobseekers Act 1995. He replied “12 weeks” to the question “How long are breaks between contracts or jobs normally?” His claim was accepted from 1 August 2007, by which time 12 weeks had elapsed since he had last worked. He appealed against the disallowance of his claim from 9 July 2007 but the tribunal dismissed his appeal. On the claimant’s further appeal the Secretary of State relied heavily on CIS/166/1994, where it was held that, under the equivalent provisions relating to income support, earnings from employment as a self-employed earner are to be taken into account for as long as the claimant remains in “gainful employment”.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 uses two distinct concepts: being “engaged in remunerative work or part-time employment” and being “employed” and it would be less confusing to use the simple word “employed” that appears in that paragraph rather than the phrase “gainfully employed” favoured in CIS/166/1994 (paragraphs 7 and 8);
2.	the nine issues accepted in CIS/166/1994 (and set out in R(JSA) 1/03) as relevant to the question of whether a person is “gainfully employed” are mainly relevant to the question of whether a person is “engaged in remunerative work or part-time employment” and not to the question of whether a person is “employed” (paragraph 9);
3.	where a person who has been self-employed claims jobseeker’s allowance, the first question that must be determined is whether he or she is still “employed” as a self-employed earner, that is whether or not he or she is still trading, and if the answer to that question is “yes”, the second question is whether, in the particular week(s) in issue, the claimant is “engaged in remunerative work or part-time employment”, that is whether the claimant is carrying out any activities connected with the self-employment in the relevant week(s) or whether by virtue of regulation 52 of the 1996 Regulations he or she is to be “treated” as engaged in work during periods of no activity that are a normal incident of self-employment, whether as part of a cycle or otherwise (paragraphs 11 and 12);
4.	if the claimant is “engaged in remunerative work or part-time employment”, the third question is whether he or she is engaged in “remunerative work” and therefore not entitled to jobseeker’s allowance or merely “part-time employment”, the difference being whether or not the claimant works for at least 16 hours per week, calculated by taking the average over the period prescribed by regulation 51(2)(b)(ii) of the 1996 Regulations (paragraphs 14 and 15);
5.	if the claimant is in “part-time employment”, it will be necessary to consider whether any earnings fall to be taken into account by applying regulation 95(1) of the 1996 Regulations to determine the period over which the earnings should be averaged, and, while findings of fact relevant to the operation of regulation 51(2)(b)(ii) may also be relevant to the operation of regulation 95(1)(b), they will not necessarily have an impact from the same date because what is relevant is the income being received rather than the income being generated by current employment (paragraph16);
6.	in this case the evidence gathered by the Secretary of State demanded that further enquiry be made about the claimant’s pattern of work and earnings before 1 May 2007 for the purpose of deciding over what period to calculate the average number of hours for which he worked, and if he was not engaged in remunerative work, whether there were any earnings to be taken into account, which would involve deciding over what period to calculate earnings (paragraphs 21 and 22).
The Judge referred the case to another tribunal but with a direction to the Secretary of State to consider the case further and either to revise his original decision or else to make a new submission to the tribunal.

Armed Forces Compensation Scheme – correct application of the Scheme – injuries resulting from medical treatment – meaning of “complex injury”, “covering” a certain area and “permanent functional limitation or restriction”– relationship between Table 4 and the other tables
Both claimants were awarded compensation by the Secretary of State under the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces (Compensation Scheme) Order 2005 (the Scheme) for fracture to the femur within Table 8 of the tariff, caused by service. In each case the fracture had been fixed with an intramedullary nail. In each case the tribunal found that the claimant had suffered a complex injury affecting all or most of the area from thigh to knee, causing a permanent functional limitation and restriction and identified descriptors in Table 2 as appropriate, significantly increasing the compensation payable. The Secretary of State appealed. The appeal was heard by a Three-Judge Panel of the Upper Tribunal, which held that the tribunals had not properly analysed the meaning of “complex injury” or “complications” and held that additional injuries resulting from medical treatment would, unless otherwise specifically dealt with in a descriptor, fall to be compensated in the usual way, so that the insertion of the intramedullary nail constituted an additional injury which should be taken into consideration when assessing the level of compensation. The Upper Tribunal also held that, for an injury to count as “covering” an area of a limb, it did not have to be visible on the surface. The Upper Tribunal went on to analyse a number of other issues relating to the interpretation of the Scheme, in particular whether either case might involve a “disorder” within Table 4. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, allowing the appeal in part, that:
1.	the starting point for all descriptors is the claimant’s overall condition as at the date of the decision on the claim including injuries which can properly be said to have been caused by service, notwithstanding that they may arise at some later date after the initial injury (paragraphs 47 to 55);
2.	the object of the exercise of choosing the relevant descriptor or descriptors is to find the appropriate descriptor or descriptors which most fully and fairly reflect the various features of the injury or illness, and there will be circumstances where it is legitimate for the decision to be informed by comparison with other parts of the Scheme, provided distortion of the application of the Scheme does not result (paragraphs 56 to 60);
3.	the fact that an injury results from medical treatment does not of itself necessarily break the chain of causation, unless it results from medical negligence, but injuries resulting from proper and appropriate medical treatment designed to cure the patient or alleviate pain cannot properly be said either to exacerbate or involve the creation of a separate injury, unless the appropriate medical treatment carries a risk of further distinct injuries, or the exacerbation of existing injuries, and the risk materialises, but may extend the area of the original injury or constitute a “complication” (paragraphs 61 to 75);
4.	the expression “complex injury” is clearly defined and it is a matter for the fact-finding tribunal to determine whether the injury affects all or most of the identified structures or not and where the decision-maker can properly treat the original injury and any subsequent injuries which are to be attributed to service as being a single injury there is no reason in principle why the second injury could not, in an appropriate case, change the characterisation of an injury to a complex injury (paragraphs 76 to 80);
5.	the word “covering” is to be construed according to its natural meaning that the injury should simply embrace the area from thigh to knee, or knee to ankle, as the case may be, whether visible on the surface or not, and the Scheme was not to be construed in accordance with the unexpressed intentions of the draftsmen (paragraphs 81 to 89);
6.	in the absence of any qualification of the words “permanent functional limitation or restriction”, the Upper Tribunal was entitled to use the concept of “more than trivial” to describe the point at which compensation would be payable and in a practical scheme intended to work broad justice it could not have been intended to draw such fine and difficult distinctions as that between moderate and non-trivial effects (paragraphs 89 to 93);
7.	recourse cannot be had to Table 4, which deals with physical disorders including infectious diseases, whenever an injury results in functional limitations or restrictions as Table 4 is intended to deal only with diseases, and in any event, if an injury falls within the detailed definition of a particular descriptor, it cannot have been the intention of the scheme that more favourable compensation can be awarded by recourse to the far more generalised terms of Table 4 (paragraphs 94, 109 and 125).
The matter was sent back to the First-tier Tribunal to reconsider the issue of compensation in the light of the guidance given by the Court.

Residence and presence conditions – presence condition – entitlement to child benefit for child not in Great Britain – meaning of “employed or self-employed person” in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 
The claimant was a Portuguese national. He came to the United Kingdom from Portugal in 2000 with his wife and youngest daughter. His two elder daughters remained in Portugal, and he sent money for their upkeep. The claimant worked in Britain and paid national insurance contributions until he became unable to work in 2004 because of ill-health. Child benefit was claimed for all three children in January 2002, but was awarded only in respect of his youngest daughter. In 2006 the claimant asked for a review and completed a form applying for child benefit for his two elder daughters. At that time he was in receipt of disability living allowance and income support and qualified for national insurance credits on the ground of incapacity for work. The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs refused his application in respect of his two elder daughters because they were not, and could not be treated as being, in Great Britain as required by section 146(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The issue on appeal was whether he could benefit from Article 73 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 as an employed or self-employed person and therefore entitled to United Kingdom family benefits in respect of members of his family residing in another Member State. The tribunal held (following R(F) 1 /94). that although he came within the personal scope of the Regulation because he had been employed in the United Kingdom he could not benefit from Article 73 because he was not employed or self-employed at the time of the claim. The Upper Tribunal judge declined to follow R(F) 1/94 on the point in issue and held that the circumstances of the claimant in the present case could not be distinguished in any relevant way from those accepted by the European Court of Justice in Case C-85/96 Martinez Sala v Freistaat Bayern [1998] ECR I-2691 and Case C-262/96 Sürül v Bundesanstalt für Arbeit [1999] ECR I-2685 as meeting the definition of “employed or self-employed person” in Article 1(a)(ii) of the Regulation, under which he could be identified as an employed or self-employed person on the basis of the relevant scheme being one for all residents or the whole working population. Provided he satisfied the condition in section 143(1) of the 1992 Act by contributing to the cost of providing for his elder daughters at a weekly rate not less than the relevant weekly rate of child benefit, they were members of his family for the purposes of Article 73 and he was entitled to child benefit for them. The Commissioners appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Commissioners argued (citing Case 17/76 Brack v Insurance Officer [1976] ECR 1429, Case 84/77 Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie d’Eure-et-Loir v Tessier [1978] ECR 7 Case C-15/90 Middleburgh v Chief Adjudication Officer [1991] ECR 1-4655 and C-4/95 and C-5/95 Stöber and Piosa Pereira v Bundesanstalt für Arbeit [1997] ECR 1-511) that the effect of the United Kingdom’s entry in Annex 1 to the Regulation was to restrict limb (ii)(a) of Article 1 to persons who are currently an “employed earner” or a “self-employed earner” within the meaning of the domestic legislation or a person claiming a benefit who was previously employed and whose national insurance contributions can be linked to the benefit claimed.  
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	Brack, Tessier, Middleburgh and Stöber do not clearly support the Commissioners’ analysis of  the effect of the United Kingdom’s entry in Annex 1 and had the Community jurisprudence ended with Stöber, there would have been sufficient doubt to warrant a reference to the European Court of Justice (paragraphs 50 to 56);
2.	doubts were, however, removed by the ECJ’s judgment in Sala, where the ECJ plainly did not require, for the purposes of Mrs Sala’s entitlement as an employed person within Article 1(a)(ii), that she should be in current employment or that there should be a link between the benefit she claimed and her previous employment, and that interpretation was confirmed by Case 182/78 Bestuur van het Algemeen Ziekenfonds Drenthe-Platteland v G Pierik [1979] ECR 1977 (paragraphs 57 to 60);
3.	that interpretation was supported by the policy underlying the Regulation disclosed by its recitals, which show that, although the Regulation is an instrument for co-ordination rather than harmonisation, the policy underlying the Regulation is that, in support of the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of Member States, employed persons and self-employed persons moving within the Community should be subject to the social security scheme of only one single Member State in order to avoid the overlapping of national provisions and ensuing complications, and that the exceptions to the general rule should be as limited as possible (paragraph 61).

The claimant was refused carer’s allowance for caring for her son because she was held to have net earnings which exceeded the earnings limit and was thus treated as gainfully employed. In accordance with regulation 10(4) of the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996 deductions were made from her gross earnings of 50 per cent of occupational and personal pension contributions but no deductions were made for income tax or national insurance contributions as she had no liability. She appealed, arguing that in a colleague’s case the carer’s allowance was treated as taxable and the resultant tax due was collected through PAYE from her earnings, reducing her net wage to an amount below the earnings limit. She submitted that her entitlement to carer’s allowance should be determined on the same basis, relying on R(IS) 4/05 where it was decided that “amount paid by way of tax” includes tax which the claimant is liable to pay. The tribunal rejected that contention, holding that the claimant could not reduce her earnings by the amount of any tax liability resulting from receipt of carer’s allowance because no tax had in fact been paid. (CG/1054/2005 followed). 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	although carer’s allowance is taxable, it does not follow that any tax to which the claimant would be liable in respect of carer’s allowance should be treated as deducted from her earnings under PAYE (paragraphs 8 and 9); 
2.	in many cases the amount of a person’s PAYE deductions cannot be predicted for a future period with any certainty, and it cannot have been intended that regulation 10(4) of the 1996 regulations should apply to liabilities for tax which could be paid by means of the PAYE system, but in respect of which no deduction has in fact been made (paragraph 9);
3.	it would be more consistent with the overall statutory scheme to take into account under regulation 10(4) only PAYE deductions in respect of employment income but there was no need to express a concluded view on that matter in this case (paragraph 10).

Tax credits – indirect discrimination against fathers by payment of child tax credit solely to principal carer – whether objectively justified

Two children lived with their mother but had extensive contact with their father who looked after them for at least three days a week. He was in receipt of means tested benefits and disability living allowance. Where parents are separated and so cannot make a joint claim, child tax credit is payable to one person only in respect of each child. Entitlement depends upon a claimant being “responsible” for one or more children. Where there are competing claims, regulation 3(1) of the Child Tax Credit Regulations 2002 provides for a child to be treated as the responsibility of whichever of the parents has “main responsibility” for that child. There were no provisions allowing child tax credits to be shared between separated parents. The father’s claim for child tax credits was refused on the ground that the mother had main responsibility for the children. The father challenged the decision on the ground that the rule restricting entitlement to one household discriminated in favour of women. The Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal both decided against him. On further appeal to the Supreme Court it was accepted by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) that child tax credit falls within the ambit of Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and that the rule that child tax credit is payable to one person only in respect of each child discriminates indirectly against fathers because they are far more likely than mothers to look after a child for a smaller number of days a week.

Held, dismissing the further appeal, that:
1.	the proper approach to justification in cases involving discrimination in state benefits is set out in the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Stec v United Kingdom (2006) 43 EHRR 47. Difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; it must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (paragraph 15);

2.	in deciding whether discrimination was justified a contracting State was entitled to a margin of appreciation which varied according to circumstances. In relation to general measures of economic or social strategy a wide margin is usually allowed to a State because national authorities are better placed than international judges to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds. Accordingly the ECtHR will generally respect the national legislature’s policy choice unless it was “manifestly without reasonable foundation” (paragraph 16); 

3.	the normal strict test for justification of sex discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights gives way to the “manifestly without reasonable foundation” test in the context of state benefits, both in relation to direct sex discrimination (Runkee v United Kingdom [2007] 2 FCR 178) and indirect discrimination, as in this case; Stec v United Kingdom (2006) 43 EHRR 47 (paragraphs 17 to 21); 

4.	in all the circumstances the “no-splitting” of child tax credit rule was a reasonable rule for the United Kingdom authorities to adopt and the indirect discrimination was justified (paragraphs 28 to 33).

The claimant’s father was discharged from service on the ground that he was unfit for military service due to depressive illness. He claimed a war disablement pension and the Secretary of State decided that he was entitled to a gratuity on the ground that he had been suffering from a depressive disorder, aggravated by service (subsequently found on appeal to be attributable to service) and causing disablement assessed at 6–14 per cent. However, by the time of that decision he had died following an epileptic fit. The claimant claimed a child allowance under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983. The claim was rejected on the ground that the claimant’s father’s death was caused by alcohol toxicity leading to an epileptic fit. By item 27 of Part II of Schedule 4 to the 1983 Order (now item 32 of Part II of Schedule 6 to the 2006 Order), an injury due to the consumption of alcohol does not count as an injury for the purposes of war pension, unless the alcohol consumption is caused by a mental condition, caused by service, assessed at 50 per cent or more. The tribunal allowed the claimant’s appeal, finding that the causative trigger in the fatal injurious process was the claimant’s father’s failure to take medication as a result of his accepted disablement of depressive disorder. The Secretary of State appealed. 
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	where alcohol consumption is the only cause of what would usually be regarded as an injury, then the statutory definition makes it plain that there is no “injury” unless the statutory exception applies (paragraph 13);
2.	however, where what would usually be regarded as an injury is due both to alcohol consumption and another independent cause, it can be an “injury” to the extent to which it is due to the other cause and the tribunal was entitled to reason that the Secretary of State had not shown beyond reasonable doubt that the alcohol would have precipitated the fit had the claimant’s father taken his medication or that the failure to take the medication was not a consequence of the depression that was attributable to service (paragraphs 16 and 17);
3.	the tribunal did err in not giving the Secretary of State any opportunity to answer that line of reasoning and for that reason its decision had to be set aside (paragraph 18);
4.	upon consideration of further evidence and submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State had not shown beyond reasonable doubt that the causal connection identified by the tribunal did not exist (paragraphs 22 to 23).

The claimant was in receipt of lower rate mobility component and middle rate care component of disability living allowance. Following a fall she applied for a supersession of the decision making the existing award and for it to be replaced by a decision awarding higher rate mobility component instead of lower rate mobility component. The Secretary of State refused to supersede the previous decision on the basis that the claimant was over 65 when her mobility needs increased. The claimant appealed to the tribunal against that decision, raising the argument that she had been discriminated against in breach of the human rights legislation. The tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State’s decision. The claimant appealed. It was common ground between the parties that, subject to arguments of human rights law, under section 75(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 as it stood there could be no entitlement to higher rate mobility component. The Secretary of State argued that there was objective and reasonable justification for making a distinction based on age, as the Government’s priority in introducing the benefit was to help primarily those of working age with mobility problems.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	if a person is unable or virtually unable to walk, which is the main non age-related condition of entitlement to higher rate mobility component, then the availability of the benefit might make all the difference between being housebound and being able to pay for transport to visit family and others and to lead a more autonomous life, and therefore the component is within the ambit of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as Article 1 of Protocol 1 (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) (paragraphs 24 to 29);
2.	while age is a status capable of being protected by Article 14, a difference of treatment in entitlement to one particular social security monetary benefit in a complex and sophisticated benefit system when the complainant has reached the age of entitlement to other benefits is not demeaning but does require rational justification as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate social policy objective (R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37, [2006] 1 AC 173 followed) (paragraphs 32 to 37);
3.	the Secretary of State had provided a rational explanation for the policy of the law and the method of achieving the objectives of that policy were proportionate (paragraph 38).

The claimant was a student nurse in receipt of an NHS bursary. She had to interrupt her course because of pregnancy and her bursary stopped. Her claim for income support was refused on the ground that she was a “full-time student” within the definition in regulation 61(1) of the Income Support (General) Regulations because she had not abandoned her course or been dismissed from it (regulation 61(2)(b)). She appealed to an appeal tribunal, arguing that regulation 61(2)(b) should be disapplied in her case as it was discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taken with Article 1 or 2 of Protocol 1. The tribunal found that there was insufficient evidence placed before it to demonstrate that intercalating women students were disproportionately discriminated against by the income support regulations. The claimant appealed.
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in failing to consider a submission on behalf of the claimant which argued that statistical evidence was not a prerequisite to establishing indirect discrimination in a human rights context, referring to O’Flynn v CAO [1998] ICR 608 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Bobezes [2005] EWCA Civ 111 (reported as R(IS) 6/05) (paragraph 9);
2.	the right to claim a non-contributory social security benefit such as income support was within the scope or ambit of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention so as to enable Article 14 to be engaged following R (RJM) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2008] UKHL 63, [2009] 1 AC 311, where it was held that the decision in Stec v United Kingdom (2005) 41 EHRR SE18 was, notwithstanding certain Court of Appeal authority to the contrary, to be followed in the United Kingdom (paragraph 10);
3.	the case did not fall within Article 2 of Protocol 1 (right to education) as there had been no denial of the right to education and the funding arrangements available for tertiary education did not fall within the ambit of Article 2 unless they had been specifically designed to discriminate against a particular category of person (R (Douglas) v North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council [2003] EWCA Civ 1847  followed) (paragraphs 11 to 14);
4.	statistics were not a necessary pre-condition to determining whether there was indirect discrimination in this case (AL (Serbia) v Home Secretary [2008] UKHL 42 and DH and others v The Czech Republic (2008) 47 EHRR 3 followed) and, the Secretary of State having conceded that pregnancy was an “other status” for the purposes of Article 14, the question was whether there was an objective and reasonable justification for disentitling pregnant intercalating students from income support (thereby distinguishing them from students who intercalate for other reasons) (paragraphs 17 and 18); 
5.	the policy behind the regulatory structure was that students who intercalate for essentially transient reasons (even through no fault of their own) should not receive benefit, but should rely on such support as might be available from the education authorities concerned, and there was objective and reasonable justification for the inclusion of intercalating students during the later term of their pregnancy within that policy (paragraph 21);
6.	(obiter) to bring the claimant within paragraph 14 (relating to pregnancy) of Schedule 1B would entail a positive legislative change, which no court or tribunal could make, and it was doubtful whether, if a breach of Article 14 were found, a statutory tribunal could give declaratory relief (such as that granted by the Court of Appeal in Francis v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 1303 (reported as R(IS) 6/06)) (paragraph 31).

Carer’s allowance – meaning of “receiving full-time education” – whether test is time spent by student or requirements of course 
The claimant had been entitled to carer’s allowance (CA) and its predecessor, invalid care allowance, since 1990. In September 2006 she started a BA honours degree at a university. In December 2006 she notified the CA unit that she had started a course. The University confirmed her place on the course and stated that she was expected to undertake supervised study averaging 27.69 hours a week over the academic year, and that it regarded her as being in full-time education. Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 people in full-time education are not entitled to CA. Regulation 5(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 provides that a person shall be treated as receiving full-time education for any period during which he attends a course of education for 21 hours a week or more, including time spent in the activities specified in paragraph (2). The decision-maker decided that the claimant was not entitled to CA from September 2006. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, saying that she was only attending at the university for 12 hours a week. Her appeal was dismissed and she appealed further. The Secretary of State argued in reliance on CG/3189/1004 that the focus of regulation 5(1) was the expectations of the institution and that it was irrelevant that the claimant had devoted less than 21 hours a week to her course. The Upper Tribunal judge allowed her appeal (AD v SSWP [2009] UKUT 46 (AAC)), considering himself bound by Wright-Turner v Department for Social Development [2002] NICA 2 (reported in appendix 1 to R1/02 (ICA)) and Flemming v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWCA Civ 641; [2002] 1 WLR 2322 (also reported as R(G) 2/02) to hold that, while the expectations of the institution were important and relevant, the fundamental test in law remained the time actually spent by the student in the activities specified in regulation 5(2). The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that regulation 5 is not exhaustive of the circumstances in which a person would be regarded as being in full-time education for the purposes of entitlement to carer’s allowance and that it was wrong to hold that the tribunals were bound by Wright-Turner and Flemming.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Court was not constrained to follow the dicta in Wright-Turner on the issue of whether regulation 5 is exhaustive, since in that case the point was conceded and also the court’s comments were obiter as it was not considering the broad question of whether or not the claimant was receiving full-time education, but only the narrow point of the proper interpretation of “supervised” and “unsupervised study”, nor did the judgment in Flemming deal with the issue (paragraphs 25 to 34);
2.	although the enabling legislation in section 70 provides for regulations as to circumstances in which a person is and is not to be treated as receiving full-time education, regulation 5 prescribes only when a person is receiving full-time education and does not dictate that a person will not be deemed to be in receipt of full-time education unless those conditions are met, and so regulation 5 cannot be exhaustive of the circumstances in which a person will be treated as being in full-time education (paragraphs 35 to 41);
3.	concentration on the hours actually spent is the wrong approach under regulation 5; the task of the fact-finding tribunal is, having balanced what is offered and what is expected of the student against the student’s actual performance of the demands made by the course, to look at the matter in the round and ask by way of testing the conclusion, whether the claimant is receiving full-time education (paragraphs 42 to 51).

The claimant was medically discharged from the Territorial Army in 1984 as a result of lower limb problems. He was awarded a war disablement pension under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 with a disablement assessed first at 40 per cent and then, from 1992, at 80 per cent. He was also awarded a Service Attributable Pension (SAP), which was payable as part of the armed forces occupational pension scheme under Defence Council Instructions 1981 and 1984 and from 2001 under the Reserve Forces (Attributable Benefits) Etc. Regulations 2001. In 1994, he was awarded an allowance for lowered standard of occupation (ALSO) under the 1983 Order at an amount lower than his SAP. In 2004, the Secretary of State decided on review that the claimant was not entitled to the ALSO as well as his SAP, relying on article 55 of the 1983 Order, which gives the Secretary of State a discretionary power to take compensation into account against any pension or gratuity under that Order. The claimant exercised his right of appeal and the tribunal decided that he was entitled to both the SAP and the ALSO, as the SAP was not “compensation” within the meaning of the Service Pensions Order. The Secretary of State appealed, arguing that the SAP was “compensation” within the definition in article 55(3).
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the purpose of article 55 was to prevent the duplication of payments and the identification of a double payment is a justiciable issue. Therefore the tribunal was required to substitute its own decision for that of the Secretary of State rather than merely review the reasonableness of the Secretary of State’s exercise of discretion (R(AF) 3/07 and R(H) 6/06 considered) (paragraphs 12 to 14);
2.	the SAP was “compensation” as defined by article 55(3) as it was a periodical payment made to the claimant, was payable in respect of the claimant’s disablement, and was paid under Defence Council Instructions and the 2001 Regulations, which fall within article 55(3)(a)(i), and so the question of the Secretary of State’s exercise of his discretion was an issue on the appeal (paragraph 22);
3.	a tribunal must exercise the discretion conferred by the legislation judicially, that is in a way that furthers the purpose of the legislation and is rational, and should have regard to the Secretary of State’s policy and explain any departure from it (R(AF) 3/07 followed) (paragraph 23);
4.	it was clear from the terms of the Defence Council Instructions and the 2001 Regulations that the SAP and the ALSO are both paid in respect of reduced earning capacity as a result of service and it was appropriate that article 55 operate to focus payment wherever possible in the occupational scheme and to prevent overlap. In this case the power had been used appropriately to further its purpose (paragraphs 24 to 41).

European Union law – discrimination on ground of sex – male-to-female transgender person remaining married to wife and claiming Category A retirement pension before Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force – whether criteria of Act apply
The claimant was born a male and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2000. She reached the pension age for a woman, then 60, in 2001 and claimed a Category A retirement pension. That claim was not decided. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force as from 4 April 2005, but the claimant was not eligible for a full gender recognition certificate because she was still married to her wife. In March 2006 she again claimed retirement pension, in anticipation of the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Case C-423/04 Richards v Secretary of State [2006] ECR 1-3585 (also reported as R(P) 1/07). On 11 April 2006 the Secretary of State awarded pension only from her 65th birthday because she did not have a full gender recognition certificate as required by paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Gender Recognition Act. On 27 April 2006 the ECJ held in Richards that upon the correct interpretation of Articles 4 and 7 of Directive 79/7/EEC the refusal of a retirement pension to a male-to-female transgender person until the age of 65 was prohibited if that person would have been entitled to such a pension at the age of 60 had she been held to be a woman as a matter of national law. The claimant’s appeal on her 2006 claim was dismissed and she appealed further. By the time this appeal was decided by the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State had made a decision refusing her 2002 claim. The Upper Tribunal held that the claimant was not entitled to a state retirement pension before her 65th birthday because she did not satisfy the criteria to be treated as a woman in all respects which could entitle her to receive a Category A state pension at the age of 60 under the Directive (CT v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2009] UKUT 49 (AAC)). The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was common ground that, following Bellinger v Bellinger [2003] UKHL 21; [2003] 2 AC 467, it was not possible under national law, before the Gender Recognition Act came into effect, to treat a person who had undergone gender re-assignment surgery as having the opposite gender to that assigned at birth.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the issue of the claimant’s rights before 4 April 2005 had to be judged on the basis of the law and the legislation in force at the time and the provisions of the Gender Recognition Act have no relevance to the law or events prior to its passing or the date when it came into effect. Insofar as the Upper Tribunal took a different view on this issue, it was wrong to do so (paragraph 38);
2.	Richards clearly established that Article 4(1) of Directive 79/7 precludes (on the grounds that it is either directly or indirectly discriminatory) a situation where there is no legislative or other legal means to give recognition to a person’s acquired gender (paragraph 42);
3.	the United Kingdom had failed to implement Directive 79/7 within the time permitted to ensure that any  national laws, regulations and administrative provisions that were contrary to the principle of “equal treatment”, as defined in Article 4(1) and interpreted in Richards, were abolished so far as concerned acquired gender and rights to pensions (paragraph 44);
4.	it is long-established case law of the ECJ that an individual may invoke the provisions of a directive which, from the viewpoint of content, are unconditional and sufficiently precise, against all national legislation which does not conform with it and the Secretary of State could not rely on the provisions of national law and the House of Lords decision in Bellinger v Bellinger to deny the claimant the right to a Category A pension as a woman as from her 60th birthday (paragraphs 45 and 46).

The parent with care applied for a variation of the calculation of the non-resident parent’s liability for child support maintenance. The Secretary of State refused the variation and the parent with care appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The tribunal allowed her appeal and agreed to a variation. The non-resident parent appealed. The Upper Tribunal judge allowed the appeal as he held the tribunal’s decision to be in error of law on a number of points. However the appeal also raised the issue as to whether a rejection of an application for a variation on preliminary consideration carried a right of appeal. Section 20 of the Child Support Act 1991, as amended, includes provision for a right of appeal against a decision not to supersede a decision on an application for a maintenance calculation, but not expressly against a decision not to revise, and in CSCS/7/2008 the Upper Tribunal judge had commented that there was no statutory right of appeal and that it was unsatisfactory that a right should have to be inferred under reference to intention.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the essence of revision is that it corrects mistakes in the decision and so where the original decision  stands unaffected the appeal lies against that decision within the terms of section 20(1)(a) (paragraph 11);
2.	it is therefore unnecessary to infer a right to appeal against a decision not to revise as the legislation itself expressly provides for an appeal against the original decision, and that is sufficient to include the original decision when a decision has been made not to revise it  (paragraph 16).
The Judge remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for reconsideration.

Child support – variation where income from company or business under control of non-resident parent– whether “just and equitable” requirement allows for part only of relevant income to be taken into account – relevance of facts found in court proceedings  – meaning of “control” – effect of failure to notify non-resident parent of application
Judicial review – scope of judicial review of the refusal of permission to appeal by the Upper Tribunal – standard to be applied
The appellant in Cart appealed to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal (whose jurisdiction has since been taken over by the First-tier Tribunal) against the refusal of the Child Support Agency to revise a variation in the level of child maintenance to be paid to the parent with care for the support of one of their children. The parent with care had applied for a variation under regulation 19(1A) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations on the ground that the non-resident parent had dividend income from his business that had not been taken into account. The appeal was dismissed and the non-resident parent applied for permission to appeal to the Child Support Commissioners. In June 2008, a Commissioner gave him permission to appeal on three grounds but refused him permission to appeal on a fourth. The functions of the Child Support Commissioners were then taken over by the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal. Section 28F(1)(b) of the Child Support Act 1991, as amended, provides that “The Secretary of State may agree to a variation if it is his opinion that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to agree to a variation. The first argument before the Upper Tribunal on behalf of the non-resident parent was that the discretion in that provision extended to a power to take into account less than the whole relevant income in applying regulation 19(1A). The Secretary of State relied on regulation 19(5), under which the “additional income” to be taken into account where paragraph (1A) applies “shall be the whole of the income …”; and regulation 25 under which effect “shall be” given to the variation by increasing the net weekly income by the weekly amount of the additional income, to argue that the whole amount must be taken into account. It was also argued that issue estoppel should operate to bind the tribunal to accept the findings on income made in matrimonial proceedings and that the tribunal had failed to justify its finding that the non-resident parent had control of the dividend income received from the business. The non-resident parent also asked for a reconsideration of the refusal of permission to appeal on the fourth ground, based on the procedural defect of non-notification of the application to the non-resident parent.
Held, by the Upper Tribunal, dismissing the appeal on the three grounds for which permission had been given and confirming refusal of  permission on the fourth, that:
1.	 the statutory scheme was not to be read as imposing an all or nothing approach as the regulations must be interpreted in a way that was consistent with the legislation as a whole and a rigid interpretation of regulation 19(5) would produce simplicity at the cost of what was fair and equitable, being contrary to the spirit of the general requirement that a variation should be agreed only if it is “just and equitable”, and also inconsistent with the duties to maintain (sections 1(1) and 28E(2)(a) of the Act) and to take account of the welfare of all children likely to be affected (sections 2 and 28F(2)(a)) (paragraphs 36 to 47);  
2.	although issue estoppel did not formally apply to child support proceedings, it was appropriate for decision-makers and tribunals to take account of, and pay proper respect to, the findings of another court. Tribunals had to make the best findings they could on the information and evidence available to them, including findings made by previous tribunals and family courts, but the significance of those findings would depend on their reliability and relevance (paragraphs 52 to 58);
3.	there was no reason to restrict control to sole control, as the language and context of regulation 19(1A) indicated that control meant effective rather than legal control and the focus of that language was on the reality and practicality of control, which was a matter of fact (paragraphs 63 to 65);
4.	  defects in the procedure or the decision could not affect the existence of the application itself and the effect of procedural failings no longer depended on whether the legislation was analysed as mandatory or directory, the focus being on the impact of the failure and on presumed statutory intention. In this case the non-resident parent was not prejudiced or worse off as a result of the defect in procedure: R v Soneji [2005] UKHL 49; [2006] 1 AC 340 cited (paragraphs 27); 
5.	  although the tribunal had misdirected itself that the just and equitable requirement imposed an all or nothing test, it had given adequate reasons for taking account of the whole amount in the present case and neither the financial position of the parent with care nor the alleged insolvency of the non-resident parent was a relevant consideration under the current scheme (paragraphs 48 to 50).
The appellant sought judicial review of the Upper Tribunal’s refusal of permission to appeal on the fourth point. The case raised the issue of the scope of judicial review of the Upper Tribunal, since the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 had conferred on the Upper Tribunal a statutory jurisdiction equivalent to the judicial review jurisdiction of the High Court, but with no express provision to limit or remove the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Court of Session to review the decisions of the Upper Tribunal. The Divisional Court held that, in the light of the system introduced by the 2007 Act, the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts should be limited to certain exceptional cases. The Court of Appeal, applying R (Sivasubramaniam) v Wandsworth County Court [2002] EWCA Civ 1738; [2003] 1 WLR 475, held that the unappealable decisions of the Upper Tribunal were amenable to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court in those cases only where the Upper Tribunal had exceeded its own jurisdiction in the sense understood prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 AC 147 or where it conducted the hearing so unfairly as to render its decision a nullity. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, where his case was heard with R (MR (Pakistan) (FC)) v the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber and another and Eba v Advocate General for Scotland [2011] UKSC 29 (reported as [2011] AACR 39).
Held, dismissing the appeals except on the preliminary issue, that:
1.	the changes in the structure of the tribunal system by the 2007 Act had brought about a strategic reorganisation of the tribunals system by making it more coherent and improving its expertise and were sufficiently significant to demand a reappraisal of the scope of the judicial review jurisdiction (paragraphs 118 to 20); 
2.	the proper use of judicial resources required a restriction on the right of recourse to the courts, even if the result was that some arguable errors of law might go uncorrected and the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law (paragraphs 41, 89 to 90, 100, 122); 
3.	however, in the absence of any clear and explicit recognition that the Upper Tribunal was to be permitted to make mistakes of law, and in view of its status as a superior court of record, empowered to set precedent, often in a highly technical and fast moving area of law, the “exceptional circumstances” approach adopted by the Court of Appeal was too narrow (paragraphs 39 to 44. 92, 100, 110 to 111);
4.	the very fact that Parliament, by section 13(6) of the 2007 Act, had prescribed the same criteria for the grant of permission to appeal from the Upper Tribunal to the Court of Appeal as apply to second-tier appeals in the courts of England and Wales destroyed any possibility of an absolutist argument to the effect that the rule of law required, post-Anisminic, unrestricted judicial review over all unappealable decisions of courts or tribunals of limited jurisdiction to ensure that they are not permitted, unsupervised by the higher courts, to commit errors of law (paragraph 99);
5.	(referring with approval to R (Wiles) v Social Security Commissioners [2010] EWCA Civ 258; [2010] AACR 30) the second-tier appeals criteria of “some important point of principle or practice” or “some other compelling reason” offered a rational and proportionate restriction upon the availability of judicial review of the refusal by the Upper Tribunal of permission to appeal to itself, and would recognise that the new and in many ways enhanced tribunal structure deserved a more restrained approach to judicial review than had previously been the case, while ensuring that important errors could still be corrected (paragraphs 57, 92, 94, 105, 130 to 131);
6.	while, in the court’s view, it would be totally disproportionate to allow the four-stage system of paper and oral applications to both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in such cases, that was a matter for the Civil Procedure Rules Committee to determine (paragraph 58, 93, 101).
The court dismissed all three cases, holding that there was nothing to bring them within the second-tier appeals criteria.

The claimant was the tenant of a three-roomed dwelling and was in receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit. She notified the local authority that her son had become a full-time student. The authority took the view that she was entitled to benefit only on the basis that she occupied her home on her own and that she was therefore entitled only to accommodation with two rooms. It referred the case to the rent officer, who determined her maximum rent on that basis. The First-tier Tribunal decided on the facts that the son was normally resident with the claimant and was a non-dependant, but that under regulation 74(7) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 no non-dependant deduction was to be made in respect of him, as he was a full-time student. The claimant was therefore entitled to housing benefit based on accommodation containing three rooms. The authority appealed. 
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in failing to consider the effect of regulation 7 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, which was not limited to questions of whether any housing benefit is payable to an applicant or not but was intended to answer the question of which home a person occupies as a dwelling for the purposes of housing benefit (R v Swale Borough Council HBRB [2000] 1 FLR 246 followed) (paragraph 20);
2.	on a correct analysis of regulation 7, a full-time student is to be treated as occupying the dwelling he normally occupies as his home during any period of absence not exceeding 52 weeks (paragraph 21);
3.	on the facts found by the tribunal the claimant’s son normally occupied as his home the dwelling occupied by the claimant as a non-dependant, in respect of whom, as a full-time student, no non-dependant deduction was applicable, and the reference to the rent officer and resulting decisions were to be set aside (paragraph 29);
4.	under regulation 58(7)(c) of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations 2006 no deduction was to be made from the claimant’s council tax benefit in respect of her son as a non-dependant (paragraphs 27 and 30).

The claimant was made bankrupt on 6 June 2007 and discharged from bankruptcy on 23 April 2008. On 4 September 2007 the local authority made decisions that she had not been entitled to housing benefit or council tax benefit for the period from 1 February 2002 to 20 November 2006, because of the amount of capital possessed by her husband, and that the resulting overpayments were recoverable from her. She appealed, arguing that the overpayments were not recoverable as her liability to repay was a bankruptcy debt incurred before the bankruptcy order and therefore, unless obtained fraudulently, was deemed to form part of the bankruptcy estate. The appeal tribunal accepted the local authority’s view that the appeal was against the local authority’s decision to exercise its discretion to recover the debt by way of deductions from the claimant’s incapacity benefit and disallowed the appeal on the basis that it had no jurisdiction to decide it. On the claimant’s further appeal it was common ground that her appeal was against the recoverability decision. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that: 
1.	there is no liability to repay an overpayment of housing benefit until a local authority has made a decision that it is recoverable under section 75 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 and so the liability that arose as a result of the decision of 4 September 2007 was not a bankruptcy debt and there could therefore be no question of there being any inhibition on the making of the decision on 4 September 2007 or of the debt being discharged on the discharge from bankruptcy on 23 April 2008 (R (Steele) v Birmingham City Council and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 1824, [2006] 1 WLR 238 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Balding [2007] EWCA Civ 1327, [2008] 1 WLR 564 followed) (paragraph 12);
2.	the only evidence before the appeal tribunal of  the claimant’s capital, including her husband’s capital, was the income support decision-maker’s decision that she was not entitled for part of the period  in issue to any income support (for which the capital limit was £8,000) but that did not show that the capital exceeded £16,000 (the limit for housing benefit and council tax benefit) for any part of the period and the amounts mentioned by the income support decision-maker should have put the appeal tribunal on enquiry to investigate the actual amounts of capital throughout the period in question (paragraphs 13 and 17);
3.	the question of whether debts have been obtained fraudulently is only relevant when the debt is a bankruptcy debt, having been incurred before the date of the bankruptcy order, and so was not relevant in this case (paragraph 14).
The Judge remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal with directions.

European Union law – Council Regulation 1408/71/EEC – effect of ECJ judgment in Case C-215/99 that care component of disability living allowance not validly listed in Annex IIa as a special non-contributory benefit – circumstances in which pensioner resident in another EU Member State entitled to continue to receive care component as a sickness benefit 
The claimant was in receipt of both components of disability living allowance (DLA) as well as state retirement pension. On 13 December 2001 he moved to Germany. The Secretary of State decided that the claimant was not entitled to either component of disability living allowance from that date because the conditions relating to presence and ordinary residence in Great Britain were not met. The appeal tribunal disallowed the claimant’s appeal, applying the British legislation, together with the identification of DLA for the purposes of Articles 10a(1) and 4(2a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 as in force in December 2001 as a special non-contributory benefit and therefore not required to be “exportable”. The claimant appealed further. The case was deferred to await the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Case C-299/05 Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union, decided on 18 October 2007 and reported at [2007] ECR I-8695. The ECJ decided that the challenged benefits in that case, which included the care component of British DLA but not the mobility component, were not validly listed in Annex IIa as “special non-contributory benefit” for the purposes of Article 4(2a), because they were properly categorised as sickness benefits. Those provisions of Regulation No 1408/71 as amended from 5 May 2005 therefore could not prevent the “export” of at least the care component of DLA as a sickness benefit to another Member State. However, the specific conditions applicable to such benefits would have to be met. Only the care component was in issue in this case, as the mobility component was to be the subject of a reference to the ECJ in other cases [Case C-537/09 Bartlett, Gonzalez Ramos and Taylor v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 5 May 2011; NG v SSWP (DLA) [2012] UKUT 26 (AAC)].
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the judgment of the ECJ in Case C-299/05 was enough on its own to secure that, with effect from 5 May 2005, Article 4(2a) could not be applied to require the payment of the care component of DLA only in the State of (habitual) residence, as one of the necessary conditions in Article 4(2a) is that the benefit in question is listed in Annex IIa and from 5 May 2005 the care component of DLA has to be regarded as not listed there and must be regarded as a sickness benefit (paragraphs 8 and 9);
2.	in relation to the period before 5 May 2005, following Case C-215/99 Jauch v Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Arbeiter [2001] ECR I-1901, it must be asked whether prior to 5 May 2005 the care component of DLA was truly a special non-contributory benefit as defined in Article 4(2a) as in force at the time. The reasoning of the ECJ in Case C-299/05 then requires the answer no and the conclusion that the care component of DLA must be regarded as a sickness benefit (paragraph 10);
3.	it followed that the question of whether Regulation No 1408/71 compelled the UK to allow the “export” of the claimant’s care component of DLA was not governed by the rules on special non-contributory benefits, but by the rules on sickness benefits, and the appeal tribunal had accordingly considered the wrong rules and failed to apply the right conditions or to make the necessary findings of fact (paragraph 11);
4.	applying those rules, the claimant came within the personal scope of the Regulation, as defined in Article 2(1), by reason of his payments and crediting of national insurance contributions as an employed person which meant that he retained that status in retirement: Case 182/78 Algemeen Ziekenfonds Drenthe-Platteland v Pierik [1979] ECR 1977 and Case C-85/96 Martinez Sala v Freistaat Bayern [1998] ECR I-2691 followed (paragraph 12);
5.	as a person entitled to a pension under UK legislation the claimant was potentially entitled to receive DLA as a sickness benefit under Article 28(1) of Regulation No 1408/71, providing he was not entitled to benefits under German legislation and that the UK was the competent State for the purposes of that Article (paragraphs 13 and 14);
6.	at the date of the decision under appeal the claimant was not entitled to benefits under German legislation, and the home care benefits to which he later became entitled under the German legislation were benefits in kind and not cash sickness benefits and therefore did not affect the operation of Article 28(1)(b) on the export of the care component of DLA as a cash sickness benefit (paragraphs 19 to 25);
7.	the case fell within the special rules for the UK in Annex VI which preserve the competence of the UK in relation to sickness benefits for those within the definition of employed or self-employed person who were last insured as such in the UK. That provision applied to the claimant because he remained within the Pierik meaning of employed or self-employed person as a pensioner, and so the UK was the competent State for the purposes of the provision of cash sickness benefits under Article 28(1)(b) (paragraphs 26 to 30);
8.	Article 28(1)(b) of Regulation No 1408/71 therefore required the “export” to Germany of the claimant’s entitlement to the care component of DLA as from 13 December 2001 and the relevant change of circumstances that occurred on 13 December 2001, of the claimant ceasing to be ordinarily resident in Great Britain, could not in law have led to an alteration in the decision awarding him DLA care component on an indefinite basis (paragraphs 31 and 32).

Care standards – registration of childminders – suspension pending an investigation
The respondents were husband and wife and well-regarded childminders registered with Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills, who acts through members of the staff of Ofsted, under the Childcare Act 2006. A child for whom they had been caring was taken to hospital by his parents and a non-accidental injury was suspected.

Care standards – registration of childminders – suspension pending an investigation
The respondents were husband and wife and well-regarded childminders registered with Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills, who acts through members of the staff of Ofsted, under the Childcare Act 2006. A child for whom they had been caring was taken to hospital by his parents and a non-accidental injury was suspected. The parents and the childminders were the four people who had had the care of the child. The childminders’ registrations were suspended by Ofsted under regulation 8 of the Childcare (Early Years and General Childcare Registers) (Common Provisions) Regulations 2008 on 16 October 2008 while the police and social services considered the case.

A revised child support maintenance assessment was made on review.  The father appealed on the ground that his earnings had not been properly calculated and that he had since been on sick leave with a further reduction in earnings.  The child support officer submitted that the assessment was incorrect because one parent benefit had not been taken into account, suggested that there was doubt about the calculation of earnings, submitted that housing costs had been wrongly calculated and submitted that the father’s period on sick leave was a matter outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  The tribunal remitted the case with directions that the father’s one parent benefit and mother’s receipt of family credit should be included in the calculation.  The father appealed to the Commissioner.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a tribunal are not entitled to allow an appeal merely because there is doubt about some part of a child support officer’s decision; they must be satisfied that the decision was actually wrong in some respect and they should be placed in a position to deal with all outstanding issues (para. 8);
2.	there was no evidence before the tribunal or the Commissioner to suggest that the father’s earnings had been wrongly calculated (paras. 9 and 10);
3.	evidence before the tribunal showed that the calculation of housing costs was wrong and the tribunal erred in law in not addressing that issue (para. 11);
4.	if a tribunal finds no error in a decision given on review under section 18, the tribunal cannot take account of subsequent changes of circumstances, save by way of suggesting that there should be a review under section 17 (para. 13);
5.	but, if a tribunal finds an error in a decision on section 18 review, the effect of allowing the appeal is that the decision on the section 18 review must be set aside and a new decision must be made by the child support officer under section 18 and, as that new decision must take account of changes of circumstances, a tribunal must deal with issues arising on those changes in order to give appropriate directions (although the period in issue is limited if there has been another assessment since the one under appeal) and therefore the tribunal erred in not holding the father’s reduced earnings while on sick leave to be a change of circumstances to be taken into account on the new assessment (paras. 13 and 14).
The Commissioner gave the decision the tribunal should have given and remitted the case to the Secretary of State with directions.

Variation – meaning of “qualifying child” – whether exclusion of contact costs with child in France inconsistent with European Union law or European Convention on Human Rights

The mother applied for a maintenance calculation against the father in respect of their daughter living with her in the United Kingdom. The father had Irish nationality but was resident in Great Britain. He applied for a variation of the rules under regulation 10(1) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 to take account of the costs of contact with another daughter, who was resident in France and for whom he was paying maintenance under an order of a French court. The maintenance calculation was correctly made under the special rules in regulation 11 of the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 as if the daughter in France were a qualifying child, but the variation was refused. The appeal tribunal allowed the father’s appeal on the basis that the child in France was a qualifying child under the general definition in section 3 of the Child Support Act 1991, so that he was entitled to a variation under regulation 10(1). The Secretary of State appealed. The father argued that the narrower definition in regulation 1(2) of the Variations Regulations was to be disapplied, either under domestic law as the context required a different definition, or as inconsistent with Article 12 (discrimination on grounds of nationality) or Article 18 (the fundamental right of free movement of citizens of the European Union between Member States) of the EC Treaty or with Articles 8 (respect for private and family life) and 14 (discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the appeal tribunal went wrong in law by failing to have regard to the definition of “qualifying child” in regulation 1(2) of the Variations Regulations, which replaced and narrowed the general meaning for the specific purposes of the Variations Regulations, as accepted as proper in principle in Secretary of State for Social Security v Maddocks, Court of Appeal 21.6.00, R(CS) 5/00 (paragraph 17);
2.	there was nothing in the context of regulation 10 that required that the regulation 1(2) definition not be applied. as the language of the enabling power in paragraph 2(3)(a) of Schedule 4B to the Act pointed strongly against the adoption of any other meaning, the immediate legislative context was entirely neutral and the effect of the provision did not create anomalies within the Child Support scheme (paragraphs 18 to 21); 
3.	although the regulation of obligations to maintain children as between their parents did not fall directly within the scope of application of the EC Treaty, it was firmly established that Member States must exercise their powers on matters within their own competence which are not purely internal subject to the fundamental freedoms set out in Articles 12 and 18 (Schempp v Finanzamt München V (Case C-403/03) [2005] ECR I-6421) (paragraphs 24 and 25);
4.	there was no discrimination on grounds of nationality in the Variations Regulations that required regulation 10 to be applied to the father as if the daughter in France were a qualifying child, as it was not the nationality of  the child or her parents but the residence of the child and her mother in France that prevented her being a qualifying child (paragraphs 27 to 30);
5.	the father had not been disadvantaged in a way that had restricted or rendered less than fully effective his Article 18(1) rights of freedom of movement between Member States, as it was not the exercise of  those rights but the continued residence of the child and her mother in France that prevented her being a qualifying child (paragraph 31 to 33);
6.	if the father could be said to have any family life with his daughter in France, the link was so tenuous and indirect as not to bring the circumstances within the ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and even if the circumstances were within that ambit, so as to invoke in principle Article 14, there was no discrimination (paragraphs 36 to 40);
7.	even if there were any difference of treatment under either EC law or the European Convention on Human Rights, that difference could easily be justified as proportionate to the legitimate objective of the primary focus on the support of children resident in the United Kingdom (paragraphs 29, 34 and 40).

Housing benefit – rent restrictions – exemption where housing-related support provided – whether accommodation can be “provided” by a body other than the landlord 
Housing benefit – rent restrictions – exemption where housing-related support provided – whether undertaking maintenance can be the provision of support 

The three claimants, who had learning disabilities, had tenancies in a house of which Care Housing Association Limited (CHA) was the landlord. Care, support and supervision were provided by care staff employed by Dawaking Care Ltd (Dawaking), who had been commissioned by Lancashire County Council (LCC), the body which had statutory duties to provide accommodation, care and support for the claimants. The three claimants applied for housing benefit. The local authority restricted the eligible rent to the local reference rent under regulation 13 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (formerly regulation 11 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 as in force since 2 January 1996). The claimants argued on appeal that their accommodation was exempt from rent restriction by virtue of the saving provision in regulation 10 of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1995. Regulation 10(6), as amended in 1999, defines exempt accommodation as including accommodation provided by certain bodies where the landlord or a person acting on its behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. An appeal tribunal allowed the appeals, finding that CHA did itself provide “support” to more than a minimal extent. The local authority appealed. By an interim decision the Upper Tribunal set aside the tribunal’s decision as wrong in law and directed a re-hearing before the Upper Tribunal. It was argued on behalf of the claimants (i) that the housing-related support was provided “on behalf of” CHA; (ii) that because LCC “commissioned” CHA to provide the accommodation and Dawaking to provide the care etc, LCC provided the accommodation and the care etc was provided on LCC’s behalf and (iii) that although Dawaking provided the care and supervision, and the bulk of the support, there was some housing-related support which was provided by CHA itself, either by its own employees or by a property repair company on its behalf. 
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	(following R(H) 2/07) the housing-related support which Dawaking provided was not provided “on behalf of” CHA (paragraph 55);
2.	the definition of “exempt accommodation” in paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 3 to the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2006 is in the context of a provision specifying how the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit is to be determined and its natural meaning is therefore that accommodation is provided by the owner or other person who, but for the grant to the claimant of the tenancy or licence, would have the right to possession, and therefore the right to permit occupation of it, and to whom the obligation to pay rent or licence fee is owed, and does not encompass persons who have played a part, however important, in the accommodation becoming available, but who have no proprietary interest in the accommodation and no entitlement to the rent (CH/3900/2005 considered) (paragraphs 56 to 65);
3.	it was at the date of the Council’s decisions contemplated and intended that CHA would provide support to the claimants in the form of (i) undertaking repair and maintenance works either going beyond its obligations under the tenancy agreements, or which it would not have had to undertake if the tenants had been without disability; (ii) undertaking adaptations to meet the claimants’ needs and (iii) advising and assisting in relation to welfare benefits. As those items of support did provide some significant benefit to the tenants and were more than minimal, they could not be ignored by application of the de minimis principle and the claimants’ accommodation was therefore “exempt accommodation” (paragraphs 66 to 100).

Capital – valuation of assets after bankruptcy order made – possibility of finding of deprivation based on claimant’s conduct during bankruptcy process 

The claimant was found by a decision-maker, and on appeal by the appeal tribunal, to have capital in excess of £16,000 and therefore to be ineligible for income-based jobseeker’s allowance on his claim made in June 2007.  The tribunal relied entirely on its findings as to capital which it found the claimant had acquired in the years up to 2005 and ignored the fact that he had been adjudged bankrupt in October 2006 and that a trustee in bankruptcy had been appointed in January 2007, although evidence of those facts had been submitted to it. The claimant appealed to the Commissioner, whose functions by the time of the decision had been transferred to the Upper Tribunal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	once a bankruptcy order is in force, a claimant’s assets should either be treated as not his capital at all or be valued at nil for benefit purposes as he is prohibited from dealing with them without the consent of the court and CIS/634/1992 was wrong in holding otherwise (CJSA/1556/2007 applied) (paragraphs 10 to 13); 
2.	it followed that a claimant could not deprive himself of capital while a bankruptcy order is in force. However, a claimant might deprive himself of capital if he submits to a bankruptcy order or delays its annulment for the purpose of securing entitlement (paragraphs 16 to 18);
3.	in the absence of satisfactory evidence of the amount for which the claimant was made bankrupt or of the amount of his debts, the tribunal had erred in making no satisfactory findings as to his assets or proper investigation as to whether he might have deprived himself of assets or concealed them prior to the bankruptcy (paragraph 19).
The Judge remitted the case to a new tribunal to investigate the bankruptcy with a suggestion that it might wish to use its powers to obtain oral or written evidence from the trustee in bankruptcy or to require the claimant to give evidence under oath.

Residence and presence conditions – person from abroad – whether local authority bound by decision on claim for income support or income-based JSA
The claimant came to the United Kingdom in January 2006. At the time of her claim for housing benefit and council tax benefit, in September 2006, she was receiving income-based jobseeker’s allowance. The local authority contacted the Department for Work and Pensions by telephone and was told that a habitual residence test had probably not been done in relation to the claimant before jobseeker’s allowance was awarded. The local authority then interviewed the claimant and decided that she was a person from abroad and therefore not entitled to housing benefit and excluded from receiving council tax benefit. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, which decided that she was entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit, as she was in receipt of income-based jobseeker’s allowance at the date of her claim and regulation 10(3B)(k) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 and regulation 7(4A)(k) of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations 2006 at the relevant time provided, for housing benefit and council tax benefit respectively, that a person who was “on” income-based jobseeker’s allowance was not a person from abroad. The local authority appealed to the Social Security Commissioner, whose functions by the time of the decision had been transferred to the Upper Tribunal. The local authority submitted that, in spite of the terms of regulation 10(3B)(k) and regulation 7(4A)(k), R(H) 9/04 was authority for the relevant local authority conducting its own investigation as to whether a claimant was habitually resident. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the terms of regulation 10(3B)(k) and regulation 7(4A)(k) clearly state that in such circumstances the claimant is not a person from abroad and any other construction would render the provisions of no effect (CH/2060/2006 cited in support) (paragraph 21);
2.	the Deputy Commissioner’s remarks in R(H) 9/04 were obiter and not binding and the Deputy Commissioner had (in CIS/34/2006) recognised that he had overlooked the effect of the then equivalent of regulation 10(3B)(k) (paragraph 22); 
3.	where a local authority and the Department for Work and Pensions have to make parallel decisions the remarks of the Deputy Commissioner at paragraphs 38 and 39 of R(H) 9/04 accurately reflect the position, but where regulation 10(3B)(k) and regulation 7(4A)(k) apply a local authority is not allowed to treat the claimant as a person from abroad where the claimant is in receipt of income-based jobseeker’s allowance (paragraph 23); 

4.	however where an award of income support or income-based jobseeker’s allowance was obtained by fraud the local authority may be able to decide that there was no award from the outset (R v South Ribble BC Housing Benefit Review Board ex parte Hamilton (2001) 33 HLR 9) (paragraph 23).

Child support – calculation of income – deprivation of income – meaning of “with a view to” reducing amount of assessable income
The mother, who was the parent with care, appealed against the decision assessing the father’s child support maintenance liability. Among other grounds of appeal, she argued that the father had deprived himself of income by giving up his second job. Paragraph 27 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 provides that where a person has intentionally deprived himself of income with a view to reducing the amount of his assessable income, his net income shall include an amount representing the income which that person would have had if he had not deprived himself of it. A tribunal found in his favour on that point and the parent with care appealed to a Child Support Commissioner. The Commissioner set aside the tribunal’s decision and directed a rehearing, referring the tribunal to the decision in R(CS) 3/00,which drew attention to the line of authority applying a “dominant purpose” test to the phrase “with a view of” in the now-repealed section 44 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914. At the rehearing the tribunal applied that test and found that the father had not deprived himself of income, but gave the parent with care permission to appeal on the meaning of “with a view to” in paragraph 27. The parent with care relied on MacDonald (Inspector of Taxes) v Dextra Accessories Ltd [2005] UKHL 47; [2005] 4 All ER 107 and R v Dooley [2005] EWCA Crim 3093; [2006] 1 WLR 775 to show that the test under paragraph 27 was not the dominant purpose test. The Commission argued for the dominant purpose test suggested in R(CS) 3/00. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while MacDonald and Dooley were decided on particular legislation and were not decisive on the interpretation of paragraph 27, they showed that “with a view to” was not limited to “dominant purpose” and was capable of a wider meaning in an appropriate context (paragraph 14);
2.	the context of the bankruptcy decisions cited in R(CS) 3/00 (and referred to in R(CS) 9/08 and CCS/4056/2004) was the avoidance of fraudulent preferences by which someone who was insolvent sought to favour one creditor at the expense of the rest and in that context the protection for completed transactions was a significant factor that justified narrowing the scope of fraudulent preferences to those in which preference was the debtor’s dominant purpose, whereas the effect of paragraph 27 was to attribute income to a parent in the calculation of child support liability. The difference meant that the two are not directly comparable (paragraphs 15 to 17);
3.	paragraph 27 imposed a subjective test, depending on the parent’s state of mind, which had to be identified as a fact, either by direct evidence or inference. The parent’s knowledge of, or attitude towards, a reduction in assessable income was relevant only in so far as it was evidence of his intention or purpose (paragraphs 21 to 23);
4.	there was no reason to exclude from paragraph 27 any case in which the reduction of assessable income was an operative purpose or intention behind the deprivation, as that was a permissible meaning for “with a view to”, was an appropriate interpretation for the language of paragraph 27 as a whole and struck a fair balance between the interests of parents and their children, giving effect to the twin functions of deterrence and protection (paragraph 25);
5.	that interpretation was supported by the contrasting language of paragraph 26(d) of the Regulations, where the term “principal purpose” was used suggesting that the meaning of “with a view to” in paragraph 27 was not the same as “principal purpose” (paragraph 26);
6.	in drawing an inference about a parent’s state of mind, factors to be considered might include the timing of the deprivation, any pressures that the parent was under from third parties, and the probabilities (paragraph 30);
7.	the formulation of the test as “significant operative purpose” as applied for the purposes of notional income and capital in social security benefits was not appropriate as “significant” did not add much to “operative” and would require inferences to be drawn with a degree of precision that would usually be unrealistic on the evidence available (paragraph 33).	
The judge set aside the decision and directed a rehearing.

War disablement pension – constant attendance allowance – whether attendance includes supervision – meaning of “continual” – nature of appeal to tribunal 
The claimant had been in receipt of a war disablement pension for many years in respect of both physical and mental disabilities and at the relevant time the degree of disablement was assessed at no less than 80 per cent. In June 2005 he made a claim for constant attendance allowance, for which the conditions are that the claimant is in receipt of a war disablement pension the degree of which is not less than 80 per cent; and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that constant attendance on the member is necessary on account of the disablement. The Secretary of State rejected the claim for constant attendance allowance and the claimant appealed to the pensions appeal tribunal, which allowed the appeal and made an award of the full day rate of the allowance. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal, relying on the fact that he had an award of the highest rate care component of disability living allowance for the contention that he was entitled to the (higher) exceptional rate of constant attendance allowance. It was argued for the Secretary of State that the use of the words “shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State” in article 8(1)(b) of the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 meant that the role of the tribunal was limited to considering the reasonableness of the Secretary of State’s decision, rather than considering the matter afresh and making its own findings.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal stands in the shoes of the Secretary of State and it would be an error of law for the tribunal not to make its own findings on any disputed or unclear matter. To decide otherwise would be to undermine the right of appeal to the tribunal (R(IB) 2/04 cited) (paragraph 10 to 16);
2.	an award of the highest rate care component of disability living allowance does not provide any kind of passport to an award of exceptional rate constant attendance allowance as the conditions are different, but any evidence in relation to one might be helpful in relation to the other, as might a tribunal’s statement of reasons and findings, and if they are available they should be taken into account (paragraphs 18 to 22);
3.	“constant” for the purposes of constant attendance allowance is not an independent condition or concept to be satisfied but is a reference to the more detailed provisions in the conditions of entitlement to each of the various rates of the allowance and “constant” and “continual” do not mean literally non-stop or uninterrupted (paragraphs 23 and 28);
4.	for the purposes of constant attendance allowance, the test is whether the attention is reasonably required to enable the severely disabled person as far as reasonably possible to live a normal life and “attendance” can in appropriate cases include what in the disability living allowance scheme is referred to as “supervision”, and can include supervision which is either precautionary or anticipatory and  emotional support (paragraphs 26 to 30);
5.	the relevant paragraphs of the Secretary of State’s guidelines are not necessarily accurate statements of the law and are capable of leading to decisions being made in error of law (paragraphs 32 to 37);
6.	the deficiencies in the tribunal’s reasoning were not, on the particular facts of this case, serious enough to amount to an error of law (paragraph 44).

Availability for work – jobseeker’s agreement – claimant refusing to apply for work of a type she did not agree to “look for” – whether availability restricted to that kind of work – whether good cause for refusing to apply for other types of work
The claimant had an NVQ2 in administration/office work and RSA typing skills and her employment before claiming jobseeker’s allowance had been as a clerical assistant. After she had been in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance for just over a year, she signed a standard form jobseeker’s agreement, in which she stated in the box “types of job I am looking for” that she was looking for types of clerical work. The only restrictions on availability mentioned in the agreement related to days and hours and locality. After four months the Jobcentre notified her of a job as a checkout operator. She refused to apply for the job and the Secretary of State imposed a sanction  of 18 weeks’ non-payment of benefit under section 19(6)(c) of the Jobseekers Act 1995 on the ground that she had failed without good cause to apply for a vacancy notified to her. The claimant appealed, contending that in her jobseeker’s agreement she had agreed to look for clerical positions and that agreement had not been varied, and that work as a checkout operator would cause her stress. The Secretary of State submitted that the statement as to the “types of job I am looking for” was not a restriction as to availability, and that any such restriction would have been noted in the box “other agreed restrictions on my availability”. The tribunal reduced the sanction period to six weeks, but concluded that the Secretary of State had the power to require a claimant to apply for a vacancy outside of the restrictions imposed in the jobseeker’s agreement and that the claimant did not have good cause for not applying for the vacancy. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the issue whether the claimant had restricted her availability for employment to the types of job which she was stated in the jobseeker’s agreement to be “looking for” was one of construction of the agreement, against the background of the relevant statutory provisions (paragraph 19);
2.	while it was arguable that the claimant was reasonably entitled to read the agreement as meaning that she was restricting her availability to work of the types she had agreed to seek, the meaning of the agreement, read as a whole, was not that she was restricting her availability to those types of job, but rather that those were the types of job which she agreed to look for in pursuance of her obligation actively to seek work (paragraphs 20 to 24);
3.	although it is clear from section 19(1) of the 1995 Act and regulation 72(2) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 that the fact that a claimant has restricted his availability to work of a particular type does not necessarily mean that he has good cause for refusing to apply for a vacancy of a different type, that is likely to be a very significant factor to be taken into account in determining good cause, at any rate where there is a significant disparity between the nature of the vacancy and the type of employment for which the claimant is required to be available (paragraphs 25 and 26);
4.	however, the nature of the employment which a claimant has agreed to “look for” is not even listed in regulation 72(2) as a factor which must be taken into account in determining good cause, and while it is permissible to take it into account, it was clear that the tribunal did so, and there was no error of law in its approach (paragraph 27).

Tribunal procedure and practice – tribunal jurisdiction in mental health cases – whether application lapses when community treatment order made 
Tribunal procedure and practice – fair hearing – role of representative appointed by tribunal – review by tribunal judge of his/her own decision 

The appellant was the mother of the second respondent patient, who was detained in a hospital managed by the first respondent NHS foundation trust. The appellant was displaced as the second respondent’s nearest relative by an order of the county court made under section 29 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The second respondent was then detained in hospital under section 3 of the Act in 2005 and remained detained for successive periods thereafter without making any application for a direction that he be discharged. In 2008 the appellant applied to a mental health review tribunal for a direction that the second respondent be discharged. While the application was pending the second respondent was made the subject of a community treatment order. A Regional Tribunal Judge of the First-tier Tribunal decided that the application before the tribunal had lapsed when the community treatment order was made and he subsequently refused to review his decision and refused permission to appeal, relying on R (SR) v Mental Health Review Tribunal [2005] EWHC 2923 (Admin). The appellant was granted permission to appeal by the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal declined to appoint the Official Solicitor as a litigation friend to act on behalf of the second respondent but instead appointed solicitors under rule 11(7)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The appeal was supported by the Secretary of State for Health, who was joined as the third respondent. The second respondent’s solicitors submitted that it might still be necessary, in order to ensure a fair hearing, for the Official Solicitor or some other person to be appointed as a litigation friend in the proceedings with a view to instructions being given to them to advance arguments in support of the appeal, although the second respondent himself did not seek to be discharged. They requested a hearing at which to argue the point. The other parties did not seek a hearing. The appellant further submitted that it was unlawful for a judge of the First-tier Tribunal to consider an application for permission to appeal from, or a review of, his or her own decision. 
Held, refusing the second respondent’s request for a hearing and allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Upper Tribunal had no statutory power to appoint a person to represent a patient’s interests other than the power contained in rule 11(7) and the powers and duties conferred on the Official Solicitor through legislation and through directions made by the Lord Chancellor were expressed in terms of proceedings in the courts rather than in tribunals; moreover, at least in this case, justice did not require anyone to be appointed in a role equivalent to that of a litigation friend (paragraph 12);
2.	there was a clear conflict of interest involved in a solicitor who felt constrained by valid instructions from a client not to argue a point then seeking instructions from another client to argue the same point, whether or not the second client had the role of litigation friend of the first client (paragraph 22);
3.	in any event, argument from lawyers instructed by a litigation friend was not the only way of ensuring that a patient’s best interests were protected and in this case the argument identified by the lawyers for the second respondent was already being advanced by experienced and competent counsel for the appellant and the third respondent (paragraphs 23 and 25);
4.	there could not be anything unfair in an initial application for permission to appeal being made to the judge who made the decision being challenged when there was an automatic right to renew the application to a superior court or tribunal and it was not unfair for a review of a decision to be carried out by the person who made the original decision when that review was merely part of the process for dealing with an application for permission to appeal (paragraph 27);
5.	section 72(1) of the Mental Health Act 1983 was to be read literally and, distinguishing R (SR) v Mental Health Review Tribunal, a tribunal had the power, or, if the conditions of section 72(1)(c) were satisfied, a duty, to direct that a person subject to a community treatment order be discharged notwithstanding that that person had made the application to the tribunal while liable to be detained under section 2 or 3 of the 1983 Act and, therefore, an application to the First-tier Tribunal made by or on behalf of a person detained under section 2 or 3 did not lapse when a community treatment order was made and accordingly the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was erroneous in point of law (paragraphs 43 to 61).
The Upper Tribunal set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remitted the case for consideration of the question whether the second respondent should be discharged.
Editor’s note: In KF v Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust [2010] UKUT 185 (AAC); [2011] AACR 3, a three-judge panel of the Upper Tribunal has held that this decision was correctly decided on the question of the construction of section 72(1) of the Mental Health Act 1983.

Jurisdiction – judicial review – whether Upper Tribunal’s judicial review jurisdiction should be used to provide interim relief pending decision of First-tier Tribunal in special educational needs case

The defendant issued an amended statement of the claimant’s special educational needs on 21 April 2009, naming a school different from that requested by the claimant and his mother. The claimant’s mother appealed on 28 April 2009 and the appeal was to be heard by the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal on 4 November 2009. The claimant had been out of school since 3 April 2009. There is no statutory provision in the Education Act 1996, tribunal rules or elsewhere for interim relief pending hearing of an appeal against a decision taken by a local authority to name a school in a statement, in distinction from decisions to cease to maintain a statement, which are suspended pending an appeal. At the end of July the claimant’s mother applied to the Administrative Court for judicial review seeking expedition and the case was referred to the Upper Tribunal to be dealt with under its judicial review powers under sections 15–18 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The relief sought was that the defendant provide funding for a placement at the school the claimant had attended between September 2008 and April 2009 or for home tuition.

Held, granting permission but dismissing the claim, that:
1.	the Upper Tribunal in exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction has power to order interim relief pending the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (R(G) v The London Borough of Barnet [2005] EWHC 1946 (Admin); [2006] ELR 4 considered) (paragraph 26);
2.	however, since the statutory structure clearly envisages that amendments to statements of special educational needs take effect forthwith despite any appeal, so that the general position is that pending hearing of an appeal a pupil will not be getting the educational provision that those acting for him consider he should receive, the jurisdiction to order relief to the same effect in judicial review proceedings should be exercised with considerable restraint and only where there are exceptional circumstances (paragraphs 27 to 29) ;
3.	compared with judicial review, which looks at the methodology of a decision taken in the past and in respect of which circumstances may have moved on, the route, established by statute, for challenging statements of special educational needs by appeal has a number of advantages as the matter will be looked at by a tribunal with members with relevant expertise and with the benefit of any further evidence that has become available up to the date of hearing and in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that time  (paragraph 30);
4.	the circumstances of this case, including the time periods involved and the severity of the claimant’s condition, were not exceptional in the context of pupils with special educational needs sufficiently severe to require a statement, and so this was not a case where relief should be granted (paragraphs 32 to 37);	

5.	while there were undoubted defects in the original decision–making process, those could, to the extent that they were relevant to what the First-tier Tribunal would have to decide, be corrected using the powers to correct any deficiency in the statement under section 326(5) of the 1996 Act (paragraph 41).

Tribunal procedure and practice – jurisdiction – whether appeal lies to Upper Tribunal against decision to make case management instruction 

Tribunal procedure and practice – legal advice and litigation privilege – disclosure of instructions to expert

The appellant appealed to the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal against the contents of an amended statement of special educational needs in respect of her daughter and the naming of the particular school. A First-tier Tribunal judge issued case management directions requiring the appellant to provide to the tribunal and to the respondent a copy of any specialist report or draft report obtained, together with a copy of the letter of instruction and details of all records and reports seen by the specialist. The appellant’s solicitors applied to the First-tier Tribunal for directions that both the instructions and the draft of any report were privileged from disclosure. On 26 July 2009 a different judge of the First-tier Tribunal refused to amend the directions as requested. The appellant’s solicitors applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the disputed parts of the directions. The First-tier Tribunal Judge refused to review the decision of 26 July 2009 and also refused permission to appeal against it to the Upper Tribunal. An Upper Tribunal Judge gave permission to appeal, limited to questions relating to the jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal to consider interlocutory appeals, questions relating to legal professional privilege, and questions relating to the power of the First-tier Tribunal to give the case management directions that were given. The respondent argued that this was in reality an attempt to appeal against the refusal to review, which is an excluded decision under section 11(5)(d) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the purpose of the exclusion in section 11(5)(d) was to prevent an appeal being brought against a review decision where it should be brought against the decision which it has been sought to have reviewed and the current appeal was in reality an appeal against the decision of 26 July 2009 confirming the decision to make the case management directions and, as such, not an excluded decision, so that there was a right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal under section 11 of the 2007 Act (Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust v MH [2009] UKUT 4 (AAC) cited) (paragraphs 14 and 15);
2.	the traditional rule is that confidential communications between a client and a legal adviser or between a legal adviser and a third party need not be given in evidence by the client and, without the client’s consent, may not be given in evidence by the legal adviser in a judicial proceeding if the communication is made either to enable the client to obtain, or the adviser to give, legal advice (“legal advice privilege”) or with reference to litigation that is actually taking place or was in the contemplation of the client (“litigation privilege”) (In Re L (A Minor) (Police Investigation: Privilege) [1997] AC 16) cited) (paragraph 16);
3.	procedural rules cannot deprive a party of substantive rights given by the general law (General Mediterranean Holdings SA v Patel and another [2000] 1 WLR 272; [1999] 3 All ER 673) and outside the specific exceptions that have developed there can be no doubt that legal advice privilege does apply to proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal and that the tribunal has no power to give a direction, compliance with which would infringe the privilege (paragraph 24); 
4.	proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal are litigation for the purposes of litigation privilege but, as the tribunal in this case did not require either party to disclose a report unless it proposed to rely upon it, there would at the time of disclosure necessarily have been a waiver of privilege in both the report and the instructions upon which it was based except insofar as the instructions contained material protected by legal advice privilege (paragraphs 29 to 31);
5.	the only error in the tribunal’s directions was that it did not expressly exclude from the ambit of the instructions that had to be disclosed any instructions to which legal advice privilege attached (paragraph 32).
The Upper Tribunal re-made the decision by substituting for the final sentences of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the case management directions the wording set out in paragraph 2 of its decision.

State pension credit – minimum guarantee – meaning of “members of a religious order fully maintained by their order""
The appellants before the Upper Tribunal were both nuns, living in different autonomous religious communities. IS was maintained from a charitable trust, of which she was a trustee. The trust ran a nursing home and playgroup, which she managed. KM was in receipt of retirement pension, which she paid to the community. They both made claims for state pension credit. The claims were refused on the ground that regulation 6(2)(b) and (3) of the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 applied, which provides that in the case of members of religious orders who are fully maintained by their order the minimum guarantee is nil and therefore there cannot be entitlement to state pension credit. Both claimants argued that they were not maintained by a religious order but by a self-maintaining religious community. In both cases the appeal tribunal allowed the appeal and the Secretary of State appealed. Before the Upper Tribunal the claimants argued that the expression “religious order” connoted the existence of centralised authority and control. The Upper Tribunal rejected that contention, holding that, to the extent that the appeal tribunals accepted the claimants’ contentions on the meaning of “religious order”, they made an error in point of law. The Upper Tribunal also held that the fact that the claimants by their own work or entitlement to benefits contributed to the funds that supported their orders did not prevent their being fully maintained by their orders and decided that the claimants were not victims for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 as, even if the legislation were discriminatory and the word “religious” were deleted, it would still apply to the claimants. IS appealed to the Court of Appeal. The discrimination argument was not pursued before the Court of Appeal. It was argued that a member of a religious order will be “fully maintained” by that order only if it is able to maintain her independently and irrespective of her own contributions to the generation of the income that enables the maintenance to be provided.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant's maintenance was correctly to be regarded as provided by the trust rather than, as the appeal tribunal appeared to accept, directly by her own efforts and for her own benefit, and that appeared to confirm the correctness of the Upper Tribunal’s decision that she was at the time of her claim being maintained by a religious order of which she was a member (paragraph 18);
2.	the proposition that “full maintenance” is only conceptually possible if the recipient is making no contribution finds no support in the language of the regulations, nor was there any reason in principle why such a qualification should be read into such language (paragraph 20);
3.	the claimant was being “fully maintained” by the order at the time she made her claim and that meant that her claim was doomed to fail, as it did. If she became incapable of continuing to contribute her services and the order were therefore unable to continue fully to maintain her, then the position would be different and a claim might be capable of being made (paragraph 21).

Retirement pension – male-to-female transgender persons obtaining gender recognition certificate after the age of 65 – whether subject to (i) reduction of additional pension to remove earnings factors accrued after age 60 and (ii) increase of pension for deferment – application of section 27 of the Social Security Act
The claimant was a male-to-female transgender person, who married while living as a man, but in March 1989 underwent gender reassignment surgery, and was divorced in 1992. The claimant continued to pay national insurance contributions until she attained the age of 65 in 1998, and was paid state retirement pension from that date, consisting of both the basic and an additional (earnings-related) element, calculated on the footing of her entitlement as a man. On 25 August 2006 a gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 was issued to her and on 27 September 2006 the Secretary of State made a supersession decision reducing the additional element of the pension with effect from 25 August 2006 on the ground of a change of circumstances, namely the issue of the gender recognition certificate. The decision-maker considered that that reduction was required by paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to the 2004 Act, which provides that the amount of pension to which a person is entitled for any period after the certificate is issued shall be decided “as if the person’s gender had always been the acquired gender”. The decision-maker reasoned that, had the claimant been a woman throughout, she would not have continued to pay national insurance contributions between the ages of 60 and 65 and earnings factors for those years would not have been taken into account in determining the amount of her additional pension. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal, which dismissed her appeal. The claimant appealed to the Social Security Commissioners. In November 2008, while her appeal was still pending, she received a refund of the national insurance contributions which she had paid between the ages of 60 and 65. The claimant’s appeal was eventually heard by a judge of the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), to which the functions of the Commissioners had been transferred.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the issue whether the additional element of the claimant’s pension should be reduced, on the ground that her contributions and earnings factors between the age of 60 and 65 could not be counted, fell within the exception  in paragraph 7(4)(a) of Schedule 5 to the 2004 Act and therefore paragraph 7(1) did not apply and the application of EC law did not require an overriding of domestic law, and so the decision of 27 September 2006 reducing the claimant’s pension was wrong (paragraphs 38 and 71);
2.	paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to the 2004 Act did not provide for an increase of basic pension on the basis of deferment as the condition in paragraph 10(a) that entitlement was actually deferred for any period ending before the gender recognition certificate is issued could never be satisfied for any period where a transgender person is aged between 60 and 65 (R(P) 2/09 followed) (paragraphs 39 to 42);
3.	on the basis of domestic law alone, there was no basis for refunding the claimant’s contributions, since the rationale for the refund was that her pension had to be recalculated in order to ignore earnings factors accrued between age 60 and 65, and if no such recalculation was required, there was no basis for refunding the contributions  and the correct decision would have been that the claimant’s pension was neither to be reduced (owing to the notional loss of earnings factors) nor increased (for deferment) from that date (paragraphs 43 to 45);
4.	however, the claimant was entitled, as was the claimant  in R(P) 2/09, to an increase of basic pension on the basis of deferment by virtue of her right to equal treatment under Council Directive 79/7 EEC following CP/428/2004, which gave effect to the judgment in Richards v SSWP [2006] ECR 1-3585 (also reported as R(P) 1/07) and, the relevant decision being that of 27 September 2006, before the decision in  CP/428/2004 was made, section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998 did not operate to prevent the decision being in error of law (paragraphs 46 to  54);
5.	the Secretary of State’s submission that no decision fell to be made applying the claimant’s rights under the Directive unless and until the claimant had unequivocally elected to rely on those rights was wrong and Criminal Proceedings against Kolpinghuis Nijmegen [1987] ECR 3969 was to be distinguished form the present case, where the application of the claimant’s rights under the Directive on 27 September 2006 would have resulted in a deferment increase and would have been to the claimant’s overall advantage (paragraphs 55 to 60);
6.	section 27(1)(b)(iii) refers to a decision made “on an application made under section 10 above for a decision as to a person’s entitlement to benefit to be superseded”, so that a decision taken on the Secretary of State’s own initiative, whenever made, would not fall within section 27 (paragraph 61);
7.	section 27 applies “in so far as the decision relates to a person’s entitlement to a benefit in respect of a period before the date of the relevant determination” and those words are not apt, in the context of the purpose of section 27, to include “entitlement” for the purpose solely of determining whether, in relation to pension entitlement during a subsequent period, there should be an increase for deferment (paragraphs 63 to 65);
8.	the refund of contributions was made on the basis of a mistaken view of the law and could not have been a ground for superseding and reducing  the claimant’s pension entitlement (paragraph 84).

Special educational needs – residential placement – whether required on educational grounds or social care grounds
Tribunal procedure – statement of reasons – whether adequate reasons for preferring evidence of one expert to that of another
The local authority appealed against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal to the effect that a child required residential education 52 weeks a year and named a particular school, notwithstanding that a place might not be available for nine months.  By the time the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal, a place had become available and the local authority had decided not to move him even if it succeeded on the appeal.  Nonetheless it wanted the appeal heard to clarify points of law, in particular the question whether the First-tier Tribunal had been correct to order a placement that might not be available for nine months, although that question was clearly academic.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the appeal was not wholly academic and the ground of appeal that was academic had been fully argued before the Upper Tribunal against a genuine factual background, was a short point and was linked to the other grounds of appeal, and would therefore be considered (Office of Communications v Floe Telecom Limited [2009] EWCA Civ 47 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem [1999] 1 AC 450 considered) (paragraphs 15 to 18);
2.	the First-tier Tribunal’s decision to name the particular school was not erroneous in point of law merely because there was a risk that a place there might not become available for nine months, given that it must, on the evidence before it, have considered there to be a substantial likelihood of a place becoming available by the beginning of the next term, and it was entitled to consider that the amendment it made to Part 4 of the statement of special educational needs was the best that could be achieved for the child once it had accepted his need for a placement in a residential school (paragraph 21);
3.	in deciding that the child needed residential education the First-tier Tribunal misunderstood the evidence of a witness, who had accepted the need for continuity in the child’s life but had not conceded that he needed residential education, and that misunderstanding suggested that it might have failed to draw a proper distinction between educational needs and social care needs (paragraphs 25 to 30);
4.	the weight to be attached to an opinion expressed on a matter beyond the professional expertise of a witness is likely to be limited and reliance on such an opinion is likely to require some explanation by a tribunal (paragraph 34);
5.	the First-tier Tribunal’s decision was erroneous in point of law because it gave inadequate reasons for its conclusion that the child required residential education and for preferring the evidence of one expert to that of another (Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Limited [2000] 1 WLR 377 (CA) followed) (paragraphs 36 to 40).

Recovery of overpayment – overpayment of housing benefit paid direct to landlord’s agent – whether recoverable from landlord as well as from agent
The claimant was entitled to housing benefit on the basis of his entitlement to income-based jobseeker’s allowance. Payment was made direct to the landlord’s agent (GP Ltd). In July 2004 the claimant ceased to be entitled to income-based jobseeker’s allowance, but failed to inform the local authority. In April 2005 the local authority became aware of the cessation of income-based jobseeker’s allowance and in June 2005 GP Ltd informed the local authority that the claimant had vacated the property with effect from 27 May 2005. The local authority decided that benefit had been overpaid from 2 August 2004 to 10 July 2005 and sought to recover the overpayment from GP Ltd. An appeal tribunal allowed GP’s appeal, finding that the overpayment was received by the local authority in its capacity as agent for the landlord, not as a principal and concluding that GP Ltd was not therefore “the person to whom it was paid” within the meaning of section 75 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (SSAA). The local authority appealed to the Social Security Commissioners, whose functions by the time the appeal was heard had been transferred to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber). It was common ground before the Upper Tribunal that, following R(H) 10/07, under the legislation in effect prior to 10 April 2006, if a local authority makes payments of housing benefit to a landlord’s agent that turn out to have been overpaid, the overpayment is recoverable from the agent under section 75(3)(a) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1992. The issue was whether, in those circumstances, it can and must also be made recoverable from the landlord, as well as the claimant, unless the landlord personally can show an exception from liability.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the extension to the definition of “landlord” in regulation 93(1) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (95(1) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006) to include inter alia agents has the effect of directly authorising payment to an agent expressly or impliedly authorised to receive rent from the tenant in question, and the claimant’s specific nomination of GP Ltd as the person to whom he wanted payment of benefit to be made, which would on the face of it bring the case within regulation 92(3) (94(3)), must give way to regulation 93(1) (95(1)) (paragraph 19 to 21);
2.	under general principles of the law of landlord and tenant and of agency, the payment of housing benefit to an agent under regulations 93 and 94 (95 and 96) goes to discharge the claimant’s liability to the landlord and in those circumstances the housing benefit has been paid not only to the agent, as decided by R(H) 10/07, but also to the landlord so that where the local authority was authorised to make payment in the way it did only by virtue of the relationship of agency between the landlord and the agent, payment to the agent would also constitute payment of housing benefit as such to the landlord (paragraphs 22 and 23);
3.	the reference in section 75(3)(a) of the SSAA to “the person to whom” benefit was paid does not require that only one person can be regarded as having had benefit paid to them for the purposes of section 75(3)(a) and recoverability as the use of the word “the” and the context of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 is quite insufficient to displace the presumption under section 6(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 that the plural was included in section 75(3)(a) (paragraphs 24 and 25);
4.	the overpayment in the present case was legally recoverable from GP Ltd and the landlord under section 75(3)(a), since neither of them escaped liability under regulation 101(1), as well as from the claimant under section 75(3)(b) and regulation 101(2)(c) of the 1987 Regulations (paragraphs 28 and 32).

European Union law – conflict of laws – Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 EC rather than Article 1 determines the national legislation applicable – whether an entitlement to national insurance credits if established brings claimant within Article 13 of Regulation 1408/71 EC
The claimant had lived in Spain from 5 December 1992 to 20 December 2006, working on a self-employed basis and paying insurance contributions under the relevant Spanish legislation. In around February 2006 she became incapable of work and was awarded a form of sickness benefit until September 2006. On 20 December 2006 she returned to the United Kingdom with her husband. She and her husband made a joint claim for income-based jobseeker’s allowance in January 2007. Her husband found work and she was advised to continue signing on in order to preserve her credit position. On 1 February 2007 she claimed incapacity benefit. Her claim was refused as she did not meet the relevant contribution conditions. The claimant appealed to an appeal tribunal arguing that insurance in the United Kingdom would as a matter of European Union law mean that United Kingdom rather than Spanish social security law applied and that she could rely on credits associated with her joint claim for income-based jobseeker’s allowance for a few weeks in January 2007 as constituting sufficient insurance for this purpose in relation to her incapacity benefit claim made in February 2007. The tribunal allowed her appeal. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber). 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	entitlement to credits under regulation 8A(1) of the Social Security (Credits) Regulations 1975 can only be decided at the end of the tax year because regulation 3 restricts entitlement to the shortfall in a claimant’s relevant earnings factor for a year (CIB/1602/2006 and CIB/3327/2004 followed) and so the tribunal was in error in holding that the claimant was in receipt of national insurance credits (paragraphs 8 to 11);
2.	it is Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 that determines the question of the national legislation applicable to a claimant and not the definitions of “competent institution” and “competent State” in Article 1(o) and (q) Kuusijärvi (Case C-275/96) [1998] ECR I-3419 and  Coppola v Insurance Officer (Case C-150/82) [1983] ECR 43 cited) (paragraphs 12 to 20);
3.	even if the claimant’s prospective entitlement to national insurance credits were to constitute sufficient insurance to bring her within the definitions of “employed person” for the purposes of Article 1(a), that did not help her in bringing herself within Article 13(2)(a) as the purpose of the provisions is different, Articles 1 and 2 being concerned with the applicability of the Regulation as a whole and, in the interests of promoting Treaty aims of freedom of movement of persons, requiring a wide interpretation while Article 13 is concerned with conflict of laws issues, and there is no reason to construe any sub-paragraph of Article 13(2) particularly widely (Martinez Sala v Freistaat Bayern (Case C-85/96) [1998] ECR I-2691 and Dodl and Oberhollenzer v Tiroler Gebietskrankenkasse (Case C-543/03) [2005] ECR I-5049 considered) (paragraphs 21 to 31);
4.	it followed that, since the claimant had not actually been employed in the UK following her return from Spain, she fell outside the scope of Article 13(2)(a) and no other provision of that Article caused her claim to be subject to UK law (paragraph 32).

European Union Law – free movement of workers – application and interpretation of the worker registration scheme
The claimants were respectively nationals of the Czech Republic (M) and Poland (B). These states, together with six other states that acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004, are known as the A8 States. The Accession Treaty relating to those States permitted derogation from the rights of freedom of movement within the Community which the United Kingdom gave effect to in the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (the 2004 Regulations). The 2004 Regulations established a registration scheme under which workers from A8 States who wished to work were required to register with the authorities. There were exceptions in relation to certain persons who had been legally working in the UK on or before 30 April 2004. Both claimants had been granted admission to the United Kingdom before 1 May 2004, M as an asylum seeker and B under a temporary visa which had expired, after her marriage to a UK national, and their subsequent separation. Both had worked for certain periods after 1 May 2004 and both had claimed jobseeker’s allowance. Claims for income support then made by both claimants were rejected on the basis that they were “persons from abroad” fixed with a nil applicable amount for the purposes of calculating their entitlement under the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. “Persons from abroad” are defined as those not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland and a person is not to be treated as habitually resident in a territory unless he has a right to reside there. Under the Income Support Regulations certain categories of persons are not to be considered as “persons from abroad” including workers for the purposes of Council Directive No 2004/38/EC and those treated as “workers” for the purpose of the definition of “qualified person” in regulation 6(1) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations). The concept of “qualified person” was modified in relation to A8 nationals by the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (the 2004 Regulations). Workers from the A8 States were required to register employment, and would only be treated as a “worker”, and therefore be a “qualified person” with a right to reside, during a period in which they were working for an authorised employer ie in registered employment. Under regulation 2 of the 2004 Regulations a person ceased to be an accession State worker requiring registration, and was in the same position as other EU nationals, after 12 months continuous registered employment, or if they had already been, or had begun, legally working in the UK before 30 April 2004 for a continuous period of 12 months. Under regulation 2(7) of the 2004 Regulations a person was legally working if he had leave to remain and work in the UK. Appeals by M to an appeal tribunal and by B to the First-tier Tribunal were unsuccessful. Both appealed to the Upper Tribunal which found that the lower tribunals had not erred in law. The claimants appealed further to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing both appeals, that:

1.	the circumstances under which both claimants worked fell outside the definition of “legal employment” under regulation 2(7) of the 2004 Regulations; Case C-192/89 Sevince v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1990] ECR I-3461 applied (paragraphs 82 to 90);

2.	the provisions of the 2004 Regulations were not disproportionate: Zalewska v Department for Social Development [2008] UKHL 67 considered (paragraphs 46 to 49).

Departure direction – contact costs – meaning of “a set pattern” 
The father (and non-resident parent) applied for a departure direction under the child support scheme in force before March 2003 on the basis of his special expenses by way of contact costs, as permitted by paragraph 2(3)(b) of Schedule 4B to the Child Support Act 1991. Regulation 14(1) of the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996 provides that where “a set pattern has been established as to frequency of contact between the absent parent and a child in respect of whom the current assessment was made” certain costs are permitted “based upon that pattern and incurred by that absent parent for the purpose of maintaining contact with that child”. The father argued that contact was once every two weeks across the year. The mother (and parent with care) contended that the father’s contact visits were more like once every three weeks. The decision-maker issued a departure direction, based on contact being once every three weeks and the father appealed. The First-tier Tribunal judge proceeded on the basis that the provisions of the law did not allow for fractions of weeks to be taken into account (ie that contact in this case took place either fortnightly or once every three weeks) and, concluding that the father had not shown that contact had occurred over the previous year on a fortnightly basis, dismissed his appeal. The father appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 3(1) of the 1996 Regulations specifies that where “any amount is required to be determined for the purposes of these Regulations, it shall be determined as a weekly amount” and plainly contemplates that the process of assessment will require an element of averaging out (R (Qazi) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2004] EWHC 1331 (Admin) (reported as R(CS) 5/04) cited) (paragraph 7);
2.	in a case where contact took place on a regular timetable (for example once every ten days), there would be a “set pattern” within regulation 14 that could not be readily expressed in terms of whole weeks and the First-tier Tribunal judge’s approach in the present case would mean that a non-resident parent in this scenario would apparently have to settle for a departure direction based on contact taking place only once every two weeks, which is clearly wrong (paragraph 8);
3.	in practice it will be difficult to adhere strictly to contact on such a regular basis and the expression “set pattern” in the context of a departure direction application for contact costs should not be read as meaning a “pattern set in stone”, but should be applied with a degree of realism and common sense, bearing in mind the practicalities of the lives of separated families (paragraphs 9 and 10);
4.	the expression “set pattern” also appears in regulation 10(3) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000, which governs variation applications for contact costs under the post-2003 “new scheme” and should be read and applied in the same broad-brush fashion in both (paragraph 11);	
5.	the test when looking at contact over a past period is not what a court has ordered or what the parties have agreed, but what actually happened, and that has to be determined on the balance of probabilities, on the best evidence available (CSC 4/98 followed) (paragraph 24).
The judge made the decision that the First-tier Tribunal should have made, finding as a fact that contact took place on 22 occasions in the relevant year and calculating the amount to be allowed by way of a departure direction.

Child support maintenance assessment – cancellation where parents attempt reconciliation – meaning of “there no longer being any qualifying child”
Following an assessment on 15 August 1999 the Secretary of State decided that as from 4 January 1999 the father was in principle liable to pay child support maintenance but that the actual amount of liability under the rules was nil. On 9 July 2003 the Secretary of State decided that as from 24 January 2003 the father was liable to pay child support maintenance of £94.21 weekly. In February 2007 the father applied to the Secretary of State for the assessment to be cancelled on the basis of a brief reconciliation between September and November of 1999. The Secretary of State cancelled the assessment (including the 2003 assessment) as from 15 July 1999, which the Secretary of State took as the date of reconciliation. The mother appealed to the tribunal against that decision and the tribunal allowed the appeal to the extent of cancelling the assessment as from 15 September 1999 rather than from 15 July 1999. The tribunal felt bound by R(CS) 8/99 and CCS/1740/2005 to uphold the rest of the decision. The tribunal gave the mother leave to appeal against its decision. The matter was transferred to the Upper Tribunal. Paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 1 to the Child Support Act 1991 provided at the material time that an assessment shall cease to have effect where by (b) there is no longer any qualifying child with respect to whom it would have effect or by (d) the absent parent and the person with care with respect to whom it was made have been living together for a continuous period of six months. Paragraph 16(1)(d) had subsequently been repealed in respect of cases under the new child support scheme. The father, supported at that stage by the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, argued that a child cannot be a qualifying child unless at least one of his or her parents is an absent parent (section 3(1) of the Act), and a parent cannot be an absent parent if he is living in the same household as the child (section 3(2)(a)), and therefore, as soon as a reconciliation takes place and the parents start living in the same household, there is no longer a qualifying child and therefore by paragraph 16(1)(b) the maintenance assessment ceases to have effect. The Upper Tribunal judge held*, disagreeing with R(CS) 8/99 and CCS/1740/2005, that the correct analysis of paragraph 16(1)(b) is that it is about there no longer being a qualifying “child”, rather than about the particular child no longer “qualifying”, and, as in the present case the child was still of the appropriate age and still with the parties during the period of reconciliation, paragraph 16(1)(b) did not come into play. However, during the period of reconciliation the father was no longer an absent parent as defined in section 3(2) of the Act and therefore there could be no duty on him to make periodical payments. As the reconciliation lasted less than six months paragraph 16(1)(d) did not come into play and at the end of the reconciliation period he resumed the status of being an absent parent and hence liability to make payments pursuant to the maintenance assessment. The father appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission as second respondent supported the interpretation of the Upper Tribunal judge.
*Decision reported as [2010] AACR 24.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	 a conclusion that a maintenance assessment would cease to have effect by reason of a short period of the parents living together would render sub-paragraph (a) (death of absent parent or parent with care) at least partially and sub-paragraph (c) (absent parent ceasing to be a parent of the qualifying child) totally redundant and would undermine sub-paragraph (d), which deals expressly with persons living together, and indeed (per Pill LJ) to import word for word the definitions in section 3 into sub-paragraph 16 would render sub-paragraph (d) absurd, since the absent parent would cease to be an absent parent as defined immediately upon the resumption of cohabitation (paragraphs 37, 55 and 56);
2.	the other sub-paragraphs in paragraph 16(1) contemplate a specific and permanent event, and it is likely that sub-paragraph (b) was also intended to apply on the occurrence of a specific event, loss of status as a child, as suggested by the wording “no longer” a qualifying child, and not a transient one. It would contradict Parliament’s plain intention that an assessment should cease to have effect only at the end of six months’ continuous cohabitation to hold that in fact it ceased to have effect at some earlier point in the period of cohabitation (paragraphs 37 and 57 to 59);
3.	the presence of section 16(6) (repealed for new cases) assumed the need for an application to the Secretary of State (now the Commission) to achieve a cancellation of the maintenance assessment when the parties were living together, a provision inconsistent with cancellation merely by living together (paragraph 37);	
4.	having regard to those factors and to the underlying purpose of the 1991 Act, sub-paragraph (b) did not have the effect for which the appellant contended. In the context of paragraph 16 as enacted at the material time, it was concerned with the continued status of the child as a child and did not operate to terminate the maintenance assessment immediately upon a return of the formerly absent parent to live with the parent with care (paragraphs 38 to 41, 59).

The claimants’ awards of disability living allowance (DLA) were withdrawn as it was decided they no longer satisfied the residence and presence conditions after they had moved elsewhere in the European Union to live. Their appeals to the appeal tribunal were dismissed and the claimants appealed to the Social Security Commissioner. He initially deferred his decision pending the outcome of Case C-299/05 Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union [2007] ECR I-8695. On 2 July 2009 the Commissioner decided the claimants were entitled to the care component of DLA as it was to be treated as a sickness benefit. However, in relation to the mobility component he referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling various questions as to the exportability of the mobility component under Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 and, if not exportable, whether there was any other law or principle of European Community law relevant to the question of whether the United Kingdom was entitled to rely on the residence and presence conditions. 

Held, that:

The amount of the mobility component is determined by the costs connected with the mobility problems suffered by the claimant in the Member State concerned and benefit is awarded to persons who cannot work because of their disability in the overwhelming majority of cases. Accordingly the mobility component of DLA constitutes a special non-contributory cash benefit within the meaning of Article 4(2a) of Regulation No 1408/71 both before and after its amendment (paragraphs 26 to 33); 
2.	it is permissible to adopt provisions derogating from the principle of the exportability of social security benefits including the mobility component of DLA. Accordingly there is nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 10a of Regulation No 1408/71 inasmuch as it allows the award of the mobility component of DLA to be made subject to conditions as to residence and presence in Great Britain (paragraphs 34 to 42).

Applicable amount – severe disability premium – whether non-dependant normally residing with claimant 
The claimant had a stroke in January 2003 and her son came from India to look after her. The claimant was awarded income support with effect from February 2003 and a disability living allowance, consisting of the mobility component and the care component. Her son’s visa expired at the end of November 2003 and his application for indefinite leave to remain was refused. He remained in the United Kingdom, living with his mother, while challenging that decision. In 2008, the claimant applied for the severe disability premium to be taken into account in her award of income support. This was refused on the ground that she did not fall to be treated as being a severely disabled person by virtue of paragraph 13(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 as she had a non-dependant aged 18 or over normally residing with her. Her appeal to the appeal tribunal was dismissed and she appealed to the Upper Tribunal. It was argued for the claimant that the normality of a non-dependant’s residence with a claimant was a question of the quality of the residence rather than a purely factual question of their living arrangements, and that, because the son’s residence with his mother in the United Kingdom after his visa expired was unlawful and his presence in the United Kingdom precarious, he was not “normally” resident with her.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the natural reading of the wording of paragraph 13(2)(a)(ii) in the context of both paragraph 13 and the regulations as a whole is that the question whether a non-dependant is “normally residing” with the claimant is a purely factual question of their living arrangements and though that interpretation may give rise to some anomalies, those anomalies are not sufficient to displace the natural reading of the language in its context (CSIS/76/1991 and CIS/3072/2004  considered) (paragraphs  20 to 23, 26);
2.	applying that interpretation, the son was clearly normally residing with the claimant (paragraph 24);
3.	although the quality of a person’s residence may be relevant to the factual question of whether that person is normally residing with a claimant, it is neither directly in issue nor decisive (paragraph 25);
4.	while there may be cases (as in CH/4004/2004) in which a person’s residence with a claimant is initially temporary, in the present case the son came to live with his mother desiring to stay for as long as his mother needed his help and he was able to remain in the country without being removed, and the circumstances showed that his residence was normal from the outset (paragraphs 32 to 34).

European Union law – free movement of workers – right of residence – meaning of “registered as a job-seeker”
The claimant, a French single parent, arrived in the United Kingdom in September 2005 with her young child. She obtained employment, but after six months was made redundant. In June 2006 she claimed income support at her local Jobcentre Plus office. It was accepted that she had established that she was seeking work by ticking a box on a habitual residence document and that she would have qualified for jobseeker’s allowance if she had claimed that benefit. The Secretary of State refused her claim on the basis that she was a “person from abroad” and therefore, by regulation 21AA of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, entitled to an applicable amount of nil. She appealed to an appeal tribunal, which allowed her appeal, holding that she had taken sufficient steps to preserve her status as a worker for the purposes of Article 7(3)(c) of Directive 2004/38/EC (the Directive), and therefore was exempted by paragraph 4(c) of regulation 21AA of the 1987 Regulations from being treated as a person from abroad. Article 7(3)(c) requires that a citizen is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment and has registered as a job-seeker with the relevant employment office. It was common ground that the claimant met the first condition and that the expression “job-seeker” in the second condition was not intended to bear the specific meaning of the word “jobseeker” as used within the United Kingdom  in legislation establishing jobseeker’s allowance, but the Secretary of State argued before the Upper Tribunal that it was nevertheless necessary for a Union citizen to make a successful claim for jobseeker’s allowance (or national insurance credits), with the associated mechanisms for control and monitoring, in order to meet the registration condition of Article 7(3)(c). The Upper Tribunal held by a majority that the Secretary of State had not shown that the United Kingdom had defined, either by legislation or administrative practice, specific mechanisms as being the only ways in which an individual could, for the purposes of Article 7(3)(c) “register as a job-seeker with the relevant employment office”. The tribunal was therefore entitled to hold that the Secretary of State’s factual concessions meant that the claimant succeeded in her appeal. Judge Howell QC, dissenting, held that on the plain wording of the provisions in force at the relevant time the second requirement introduced for the first time by Article 7(3)(c) was additional to and more specific than the first, in requiring a procedure to be gone through with the employment authorities in the host Member State to verify and establish a genuine continuing status as a job-seeker and hence connection with the labour market in that State. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the Directive had to be seen in its context as a measure relating to the rights which derived from Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which secures freedom of movement for workers within the Union by abolishing discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment (paragraph 10);
2.	the reference in Article 7(3)(c) to registration as a job-seeker enabled a Member State to flesh out the concept of registration so as to oblige a claimant in relation to a particular social benefit to comply with reasonable continuing requirements which would enable the Member State to monitor his conscientiousness as a seeker of employment. However, in the absence of any express requirements in the United Kingdom legislation in relation to income support, it was not permissible to construe the concept of “registration” in Article 7(3)(c) as embracing a requirement of EU law obliging a claimant to subject himself to continuing monitoring and it was consistent with the ordinary and natural meaning of the word “register” to construe the registration requirement in Article 7(3)(c) as being satisfied by the claimant’s ticking the box to confirm that she was seeking employment (paragraphs 12 to 13);
3.	while the Directive envisaged that a host Member State could prescribe a control procedure over and above registration to ensure that work-seekers’ benefits were granted only to those actively seeking employment, Parliament had patently omitted to prescribe such control mechanisms in relation to income support, and since the Directive was intended to simplify and strengthen the Treaty right of free movement of workers, a prescriptive interpretation of Article 7(3)(c) would fly in the face of the requirement of legal certainty under EU law with its emphasis on “specificity, precision and clarity” in the implementation of obligations (paragraphs 17 to 22);
4.	(per Moses LJ) the Upper Tribunal in its majority decision failed properly to recognise that Article 7(3)(c) did impose two requirements, both being in duly recorded involuntary employment and registration as a job-seeker. But all that followed from that was that the Directive imposed upon Member States an obligation to put in place a lawful system of registration whereby that Member State can undertake monitoring and control in order to assess whether a particular applicant has in truth a genuine link with economic activity in this country. However, in the present case there was a total failure to put in place a system of registration that satisfied the obligations of legal certainty. Absent such a lawful system for registration, it was both unlawful and unjust, for the Secretary of State to decide that the claimant was not entitled to income support (paragraphs 26 to 27).

Housing benefit – occupation of the home and temporary absence – convicted prisoner serving 15 weeks in prison – meaning of “undergoing medical treatment in accommodation other than residential accommodation”
The claimant was in prison for 15 weeks following conviction. It was clear from the date of sentencing that the actual period to be served was likely to be between 14 and 17 weeks. Throughout this period he suffered from Crohn’s Disease and was on medication. The local authority decided that he was not entitled to housing benefit for the period of absence because he did not meet the conditions of regulation 7(13)(c) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, which provides that a claimant is to be treated as occupying a dwelling as his home where the period of absence is unlikely to exceed 13 weeks. The First-tier Tribunal agreed that that was correct and that neither the tribunal nor the local authority had any discretion in the matter if those conditions were not met. However the tribunal found that he was undergoing medical treatment in accommodation other than residential accommodation and therefore fell within one of the categories of person within regulation 7(16)(c) who could under regulation 7(17) retain entitlement to housing benefit for absences of up to 52 weeks. The local authority appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the statutory language of regulation 7(13)(c), unlike that of regulation 7(16)(d), excludes any discretion to pay for up to 13 weeks where the absence is unlikely to be substantially longer (paragraphs 12 to 16);
2.	the tribunal erred in law in that it adopted an unduly literalist interpretation of the narrow terms of regulation 7(16)(c) without having regard to the wider context of the regulation, which requires that there must be a connection between the reason for the absence from home and being within one of the specified categories of claimant in regulation 7(16)(c) (paragraphs 20 and 21);
3.	the word “while” in regulation 7(16)(b) does not appear in the parallel provision in regulation 7(13)(b), and was added here to demonstrate the need for some causality between the absence and the prescribed status, a requirement which is irrelevant under the blanket 13-week rule, which potentially applies to all housing benefit claimants temporarily away from home for whatever reason (paragraph 23);
4.	the fact that special provision is made for remand prisoners, who may qualify under the 52-week rule (see regulation 7(16)(c)(i)) and also for prisoners on temporary release, is a strong indication that convicted prisoners are meant to be excluded (paragraph 24);
5.	when the temporary absence rules were changed, the Social Security Advisory Committee recommended that the there should be a discretion to pay for up to 13 weeks where the absence is unlikely to be substantially longer and that convicted prisoners with special needs should have protection for up to 52 weeks, but the Government rejected both those recommendations and the current regulations carry that policy intent into effect (paragraphs 28 to 31);
6.	the First-tier Tribunal misinterpreted and so misapplied regulation 7(16)(c)(iii) and its decision must be set aside (paragraph 32).

Failure to comply with jobseeking conditions – prescribed period for benefit sanction – whether “preceding 12 months” calculated from date of determination or date of relevant conduct 
The claimant was in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance, and on two occasions within a 12 months period acted so as to give rise to one of the circumstances in section 19(5) of the Jobseekers Act 1995, in which the allowance is not to be payable for such period as may be prescribed. Regulation 69(1)(a) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 prescribes a period of two weeks in any case that is not otherwise prescribed for under regulation 69(1). Regulation 69(1)(b)(i) prescribes a period of four weeks where on a previous occasion the jobseeker’s allowance was determined not to be payable in circumstances falling within section 19(5) and “the first date on which the jobseeker’s allowance was not payable to [the claimant] on that previous occasion falls within the period of 12 months preceding the date of the determination mentioned in (b)(i) above”. The regulation goes on to provide for a period of 26 weeks’ non-payment where there have been two previous determinations in that 12 months period. A sanction was first imposed on the claimant in December 2008, when it was determined that the allowance should not be paid for two weeks. In February 2009 the Secretary of State considered events in October 2008 and decided that the sanction required for that was a four-week sanction. The claimant appealed and the First-tier Tribunal determined that the appropriate sanction was only two weeks because in October 2008 there had been no previous sanction. The tribunal held that the question of whether or not there was a previous occasion on which the allowance had been determined not to be payable was to be judged at the date of the claimant’s refusal, not at the date of the Secretary of State’s decision, and observed that on the Secretary of State’s interpretation, three refusals in one day would result in a 32-week sanction straight away. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 69(1)(b) is clear that the date from which the 12 months is to be measured is the first date on which the jobseeker’s allowance was not payable as a result of the previous determination, and it is to be measured to the date of the determination under consideration (paragraphs 8 and 9);
2.	even if three separate sanctions were imposed in one day for three refusals by a claimant, that would be unlikely to result in a 32-week sanction straight away, since the prescribed period would normally only begin after the date of the decisions (see regulation 69(2)), so that the first date on which the allowance was not payable under the first decision would come after, and not before, the date of the second and third determinations (paragraph 10).

Maintenance assessment – student – meaning of “attending a full-time course”
The father was employed at a college of further education as a lecturer at a starting salary of just over £23,000 a year working 37 hours a week. He was also a student at the same college on a two-year trainee teacher course which was mandatory for him to practise as a lecturer. The college described the course as full-time and confirmed that he was attending for 15 hours a week. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the father was not a “student” for the purpose of regulation 5 of the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 (the MASC Regulations), which provides that students have a nil liability for child support and defines “student” as “a person … attending a full-time course of study at an educational establishment”. The father appealed to the Upper Tribunal. It was not in dispute that the father was attending a course of study at an educational establishment. The issue was whether or not it was a full-time course of study. The father argued that “full-time” meant a course at a recognised school or college where there is at least 12 hours a week tuition, relying on paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculation Procedure) Regulations 2000.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the phrase “a full-time course of study” is not defined in the Child Support Act 1991 and the definition in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculation Procedure) Regulations 2000 applies only to those particular regulations and section 55 of the Child Support Act 1991, and in particular to the concept of a “qualifying child”, and had no relevance to the separate question as to whether the father was, for the purposes of the nil rate liability, attending a full-time course of study and thus a “student” under a different set of regulations (paragraphs 18 to 28);
2.	the First-tier Tribunal had been correct to hold (applying CIS/152/1994) that whether a person is attending a course of full-time study is ultimately a question of fact and the tribunal was entitled to reach the conclusion that the college’s designation of the course was not conclusive of the matter, given the overall circumstances and in particular the employment context, and having regard to the purpose of the child support legislation (paragraphs 29 to 34);
3.	the father did not fall to be treated as attending a full-time course of study by virtue of regulation 1(2((b) of the MASC Regulations as he did not fall within the statutory definition of a “sandwich course” as a course consisting of alternate periods of full-time study in an institution and periods of experience at a place outside the institution, excluding teaching practice (paragraphs 40 to 45);
4.	although the First-tier Tribunal had dealt rather briefly with the father’s arguments, it made a fundamental finding of fact, based on the judge’s evaluation of the evidence, and explained clearly and concisely why that finding led to the conclusion that the father’s appeal failed and so the decision disclosed no error of law (paragraphs 53 to 55).

European Union law – free movement and citizenship of the Union – residence and presence conditions for incapacity benefit in youth – whether conditions precluded by European law 
The claimant was a British national born in November 1989 who had Down’s syndrome. She moved with her parents to Spain in August 2000 and they had lived there since then. Her mother, as her appointee, made a claim for short-term non-contributory incapacity benefit, referred to as “incapacity benefit in youth”, for her daughter from her 16th birthday. The claim was refused by the Secretary of State on the ground that the claimant did not satisfy the condition of presence in Great Britain. Her mother appealed on her behalf against the decision. Following rejection of that appeal, she appealed to the Upper Tribunal, claiming that the decision refusing to award her daughter such incapacity benefit was incompatible with European Union law. It was common ground that the claimant satisfied all the conditions for an award of short-term incapacity benefit in youth, except those prescribed in regulation 16(1) of the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) Regulations 1994 connected with ordinary residence, past presence and presence in Great Britain on the date of claim. The Upper Tribunal stayed the proceedings and referred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling on the questions whether short-term incapacity benefit in youth is an invalidity benefit within the meaning of Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and, if so, whether the three conditions in regulation 16(1) of the 1994 Regulations are compatible with the law of the European Union ([2011] UKUT 35). It was not disputed that both the benefit in issue and the claimant came within the scope of Regulation 1408/71.
Held, that:
1.	where it is established, at the time of the claim, that the claimant has a permanent or long-term disability, short-term incapacity benefit in youth has, in view of the continuity between it and long-term incapacity benefit, the characteristics of an invalidity benefit within the meaning of Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1408/71 (paragraphs 43 to 54);
2.	the purpose of Article 10 of Regulation No 1408/71 is to protect the persons concerned against any adverse effects that might arise from the transfer of their residence from one Member State to another. It followed from that principle not only that the person concerned retains the right to receive benefits referred to in that provision acquired under the legislation of one or more Member States even after taking up residence in another Member State, but also that the acquisition of such entitlement may not be refused on the sole ground that the person does not reside in the Member State in which the institution responsible for payment is situated: Case 51/73 Smieja [1973] ECR 1213, Case 92/81 Camera [1982] ECR 2213 and Joined Cases 379/85 to 381/85 and 93/86 Giletti and Others [1987] ECR 955 followed (paragraphs 61 to 63);
3.	incapacity benefit in youth did not fall within the exception laid down in Article 10a of Regulation No 1408/71 under which special non-contributory benefits were not exportable, as it was not listed in Annex IIa to that Regulation, and since no other provision of the Regulation allowed Member States to derogate, in a situation such as that of the claimant, from the principle, enshrined in Article 10(1), of waiving residence clauses, it followed that invalidity benefits are, as a rule, exportable to a Member State other than that in which the institution responsible for payment is situated: Case C-20/96 Snares [1997] ECR I-6057 and Case C-228/07 Petersen [2008] ECR I-6989 (paragraphs 67 and 68);
4.	in exercising their powers to determine the conditions concerning entitlement to benefits, Member States must comply with the law of the European Union and, in particular, with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) giving every citizen of the Union the right to move and reside within the territory of the Member State, and it would be incompatible with that right were citizens to receive, in the Member State of which they are nationals, treatment less favourable than that which they would enjoy if they had not availed themselves of the opportunities offered by the Treaty in relation to freedom of movement: Case C-224/98 D’Hoop [2002] ECR I-6191. Such a restriction can be justified only if it is based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and is proportionate to the legitimate objective of the national provisions (paragraphs 83 to 87);
5.	national legislation which makes acquisition of the right to short-term incapacity benefit in youth subject to a condition of past presence in the competent Member State to the exclusion of any other element enabling the existence of a genuine link between the claimant and that Member State to be established, goes beyond what is necessary to attain the objective pursued and therefore amounts to an unjustified restriction on the freedoms guaranteed by Article 21(1) TFEU for every citizen of the Union and is precluded by European law (paragraphs 90 to 104);
6.	the condition of presence in the competent Member State on the date on which the claim is made also constituted  a restriction on the freedoms conferred by Article 21(1) TFEU on citizens of the Union which could not be justified as appropriate to attain the legitimate objective of the national provisions, as it enables neither a genuine link to be established between those claimants and the competent Member State nor the financial balance of the national social security system to be preserved and is therefore precluded by European law (paragraphs 105 to 110).	
Following the decision of the Court, the Upper Tribunal judge decided that the claimant was not barred from entitlement on her claim for incapacity benefit in youth by reason of the presence and residence conditions in the legislation governing that benefit.

Human rights – Article 14 discrimination – whether conditions for funeral payments unlawfully discriminate against prisoners 
The claimant’s son died while she was serving a sentence of imprisonment. She applied for a funeral payment from the social fund in respect of his funeral. The Secretary of State refused her application on the ground that she was not in receipt of a qualifying benefit as required by regulation 7 of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 1987 (since replaced, but not materially changed by regulation 7 of the 2005 Regulations). An appeal tribunal allowed her appeal. The Secretary of State appealed. It was common ground in the appeal that the Secretary of State’s decision had been correct under domestic law. The issue was whether the refusal of a funeral payment violated the claimant’s right under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), not to be subjected to unlawful discrimination. The Upper Tribunal judge identified that only a very small proportion of convicted prisoners would be eligible for the qualifying benefits, but concluded that regulation 7 did not directly discriminate against prisoners, since there was no express rule denying prisoners an entitlement to some of the benefits, and that if there were indirect discrimination, it would be proportionate to the objective of regulation 7. The claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal the Secretary of State accepted that both Article 8 and Article 1 of the First Protocol in the European Convention on Human Rights were engaged and that the funeral payment scheme was indirectly discriminatory against prisoners. The Secretary of State argued that the discrimination was justified as it would be administratively complicated and costly to establish a separate mechanism for means-testing benefits, and that the change would have to have an impact on a wider group of potential beneficiaries and would be disproportionate given that the state made alternative provision by requiring public authorities to provide a funeral. It had been contended by the Secretary of State that depriving many prisoners of access to funeral payments formed part of their punishment, but that contention, which was rejected by the Upper Tribunal judge, was withdrawn by the time the case was heard by the Court of Appeal. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there was no direct discrimination, as being a prisoner did not in itself exclude the claimant from entitlement to all qualifying benefits, and it did not therefore exclude her from entitlement to a funeral payment. Being a prisoner was not “the reason why” she was refused a funeral payment, nor could it be said that “but for” being a prisoner she would have qualified: Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] UKHL 11; [2003] 2 All ER 26, James v Eastleigh BC [1990] 2 AC 751, Stec v United Kingdom (2005) 41 EHRR SE18 followed (paragraphs 18 to 19);
2.	it was clearly correct that the funeral payment scheme was indirectly discriminatory against prisoners in that it was more difficult for a prisoner than a non-prisoner to qualify for such a benefit (paragraph 20);
3.	discrimination on grounds of prisoner status was plainly discrimination of a non-suspect kind, falling within “other” status in Article 14, and so merely required some rational justification and not the intense scrutiny demanded by discrimination on the ground of an inherent characteristic, like race or sex: Shelley v UK (2008) 46 EHRR SE16 cited (paragraphs 21 and 22); 
4.	while the judiciary should accord the legislature or the executive a wide margin of appreciation or discretion when considering discrimination in the arena of social policy, if the Secretary of State relies on administrative convenience and “bright line” rules he must show some “seriously adverse consequences” to justify the discrimination: Francis v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 1303; [2006] 1 WLR 3202, also reported as R(IS) 6/06, followed (paragraphs 23 to 27);
5.	to create a separate means-test for funeral payments for prisoners, whether alone or with other excluded groups, would be a significant change from the simple scheme introduced by Parliament in 1987, with significant ramifications in delay and expense, and the Secretary of State had therefore established a rational justification for the discriminatory treatment of most of the prisoners who seek funeral payments (paragraphs 33 to 35).

Mental health – restriction order – patient convicted of manslaughter relatively unlikely to reoffend – whether adequate reasons given for maintaining restriction order
Human rights – burden of proof – whether tribunal’s approach to discretion in breach of Article 5 or Article 8 of the Convention 
Tribunal practice – permission to appeal to Court of Appeal – new issue raised after decision of Upper Tribunal 
The appellant was convicted of manslaughter in 1978 and made the subject of a hospital order and a restriction order. In 1986 he was conditionally discharged, but was recalled to hospital in 1997. In 1998 he was again granted a conditional discharge. In 2008 he applied to the First-tier Tribunal for a direction that the restriction order cease to have effect. His application was supported by the mental health team but opposed by the Secretary of State for Justice. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that, although he was relatively unlikely to seriously offend again, there remained a real risk to the public and to himself from his mental disorder with an attendant risk of his recall to hospital and that it was desirable to continue the present conditions, which minimised that risk. It therefore refused to remove the restrictions as it was not satisfied that it was not appropriate for him to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment, following R (SC) v the Mental Health Review Tribunal and the Secretary of State for Health [2005] EWHC 17 (Admin); [2005] MHLR 31 as to the correct approach to its discretion under section 75(3) of the Mental Health Act 1983. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal on the ground that the First-tier Tribunal had given inadequate reasons for its decision, given the support of the mental health team. The Upper Tribunal judge rejected that contention, holding that the First-tier Tribunal had had the relevant criteria in mind and had properly had regard to the appellant’s vulnerabilities and the seriousness of the offences of which he had been convicted, but granted the appellant permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal it was argued for the appellant for the first time that, in the light of R (H) v Mental Health Review Tribunal, North and East London Region and the Secretary of State for Health [2001] EWCA Civ 415 (Admin); [2002] QB 1, SC had been wrongly decided in respect of section 75(3) of the Mental Health Act 1983 because it was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights for the burden of proof under the Act to be on a psychiatric patient.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	in H the Court of Appeal had held that the test in the form in which it was then enacted in section 72 of the Act, as applied by section 73 to restricted patients, was incompatible with Article 5(1) and (4) of the Convention because the patient would not be discharged unless the tribunal was satisfied that he was not suffering from a mental condition which made it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained and sections 72 and 73 had been amended in response, but in a section 75(3) case Article 5 would not be engaged unless and until the appellant were recalled (paragraphs 23 to 25);
2.	assuming that the conditions imposed on a conditional discharge were capable of amounting to an interference with a patient’s private life for the purposes of Article 8.1, it was neither unfair, nor in any way disproportionate or unnecessary, where a patient is subject to an order made by a competent court after a criminal trial, to require him to satisfy the First-tier Tribunal that the order should cease to have effect (paragraphs 26 to 28);
3.	when considering applications under section 75(3), the First-tier Tribunal is not concerned with finding facts which are capable of exact demonstration, but rather with a process of judgment, evaluation and assessment and, while the burden of proof has a potential part to play in that process, the tribunal generally should not need to have specific regard to any burden of proof: R (N) v Mental Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region) [2005] EWCA Civ 1605 (paragraph 29);
4.	the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to disagree with the conclusion of the professionally qualified witnesses and, bearing in mind the gravity of the index offences, the circumstances leading to the appellant’s recall in 1997, and the fact that he still suffered from a mental disorder requiring psychiatric support, the fact that it could, at most, be said that he was “relatively unlikely to seriously offend again” was not sufficient to persuade the tribunal that there was no longer a real risk to the public with an attendant risk of recall (paragraphs 30 to 32);
5.	particular care should be exercised by the Upper Tribunal before granting permission to appeal on a ground that was not raised below and, if it does consider it appropriate to grant permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because it is satisfied that one or more of the grounds of appeal raises an important point of principle or practice, it should carefully consider whether the grant of permission should be limited to that ground or grounds and consideration should also be given to eliciting a response from the other party/parties before granting permission (paragraphs 36 and 37).

Recovery of overpayment – housing and council tax benefit – official error and separate causation
(Paragraphs 1 to 27 and 49 to 63 only are reproduced see note to paragraph 27).
The claimant was awarded housing and council tax benefit from 23 May 2005. Between that date and January 2007 she failed to report promptly a number of relevant changes of circumstances, but the council also made errors, in particular treating her husband’s weekly earnings as if they were monthly, and the combined effect was that she was overpaid benefit over an extended period. In April 2007 the claim was finally reassessed correctly from the beginning and the council claimed to recover all the overpaid amounts from the claimant without differentiation. It acknowledged that there had been a mistake in its own calculations but determined that the totals overpaid were still legally recoverable from her under sections 75–76 Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the relevant regulations. The claimant appealed to the tribunal which held that it was not necessary to differentiate within the overall total between amounts that had been overpaid for different reasons, so that she was liable to repay the whole as a person who had “contributed to the overpayment” within regulation 100(3) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. The tribunal cited R (Sier) v Cambridge CC HBRB (unreported 8 October 2001) [2001] EWCA Civ 1523 as authority that an overpayment was automatically recoverable if the claimant had contributed to it. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it follows clearly from the definition of “overpayment” in regulation 99 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 as “any amount” to which there was no true entitlement that overpaid amounts identifiable as attributable to separate and distinct causes, though comprised in the same total payment or credit as others, may need to be separated out and the causal and other inquiries required by regulation 100 applied to them separately (CH/858/2006 approved) (paragraphs 16 to 18);
2.	that approach was not inconsistent with the principle in Sier that causation in this context is concerned with the practical question of what really caused the overpayment in issue to be made: the question of different amounts overpaid from different causes within an overall total was not addressed in that case but the same factual and common-sense approach requires regulation 100 to be applied to such amounts separately (paragraphs 19 to 23);
3.	Sier does not stand as authority for any idea that the actual wording of the legislation should be ignored, or treated as if it said “overpayment” rather than “mistake” when or if any question of contribution to an official mistake should come to be considered and the notion of “contributing to” is best kept for the cases where the legislation expressly provides for it, and not allowed to confuse the primary question of the cause of a particular amount having been overpaid (paragraph 24);
4.	the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was therefore based on a misunderstanding of the effect of Sier and was erroneous in law (paragraph 26);
5.	in the present case the overpayments that resulted from the husband’s weekly earnings being wrongly entered and miscalculated were solely caused by an official error to which the claimant in no way contributed (paragraphs 50 to 54);
6.	there must come a point at which a claimant who has provided the correct information is entitled to assume the authority knows what it is doing and it would not have been reasonable to expect the claimant to realise that the benefit the council had confirmed three times as payable, after it had all the right figures, still included an overpayment due to the miscalculation of her husband’s weekly earnings: it followed that regulation 100(2) applied and the amounts overpaid from that cause were not recoverable (paragraphs 58 to 63).

Mr M and Miss M completed the purchase of their home on 14 November 2006. The purchase price and costs totalled £94,793, £42,000 of which they borrowed under a first mortgage. On 16 November 2006, Mr M signed a loan agreement with Mr and Mrs B who agreed to loan £54,000 to Mr M, to be repaid by instalments with interest. The agreement provided that the loan was secured on the home. £52,543.93 of the loan was required to complete the purchase of the property. The First-tier Tribunal, on Miss M’s appeal against a decision assessing the amount of child support maintenance to be paid to Mr M, directed that in calculating the amount of Mr M’s housing costs the interest payable under the loan agreement was to be included. On Miss M’s appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal Judge set aside the First-tier Tribunal’s decision as wrong in law on the ground that exempt income had been wrongly calculated, and re-made the decision, making his own findings of fact. The Judge accepted that £52,543.93 of the sum lent under the loan agreement had been taken out to complete the purchase of the property. He found that this loan operated as a charge on Mr M’s beneficial interest in the home and not on the legal estate of the property. The question of law was whether sums payable pursuant to a charge secured only on the beneficial interest of one of the beneficial owners could be included as a housing cost for the purposes of calculating exempt and protected income.

Held, allowing the appeal but substituting a decision in the non resident parent’s favour, that:

1.	The charge on the non-resident parent’s beneficial interest was a mortgage or charge to which his home was subject, within the meaning of paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 3 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (paragraph 36);

2.	Paragraph 3(2) applies explicitly only to exempt income but must apply equally to mortgage interest which is eligible as a housing cost in respect of protected income pursuant to paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 3 (paragraph 32).

Mental health – detention under the Mental Health Act – patient with personality disorder – whether appropriate medical treatment available
In 2003, the patient was sentenced to imprisonment for five years for offences involving violence. In July 2006, he was transferred to Rampton Hospital under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. He was also subject, by virtue of section 49, to the special restrictions under section 41, with the result that he was detained in hospital at a time when he would have been released from prison. He applied to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which decided that he should not be discharged. In November 2007, he applied for his detention to be considered again by the tribunal. The case was heard in February 2009, by which time the mental health jurisdiction had been transferred to the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. The tribunal decided that he was not to be discharged, finding that he had a psychopathic personality disorder and that he was at risk of violent re-offending. On the question of treatment it found that, although his psychological defence mechanisms prevented him from engaging with therapy, he had the potential to benefit from the milieu of the ward, both for its short term effects and for the possibility that it would break through the defence mechanisms and allow him later to engage in therapy. The Regional Tribunal Judge of the First-tier Tribunal gave him permission to appeal because the application raised issues as to the interpretation of the provision in Section 72(1)(b)(iia) of the Mental Health Act 1983 that a tribunal shall discharge a patient if it is not satisfied that appropriate medical treatment is available to him. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	section 145(4) provides that it is sufficient if the treatment is for the purpose of preventing a worsening of the symptoms or manifestations and that envisages that the treatment required may not reduce the risk posed by the patient, and it is also sufficient if it will alleviate but one of the symptoms or manifestations, regardless of the impact on the risk posed by the patient (paragraph 34);
2.	if there was no prospect of the patient progressing beyond milieu, his detention would become mere containment and there might come a point at which detention was no longer appropriate, but in this case the facts found by the tribunal showed that the patient had not reached that position as there was the potential for the milieu to benefit the patient in both the short and longer term (paragraph 35);
3.	the tribunal was entitled to accept the evidence of the ward manager as someone who had more, and more regular, contact with the patient than any other witness and who was able to speak to the patient’s progress and, based on that, his ability to progress further (paragraph 41);
4.	the tribunal correctly identified the relevant provisions of the Mental Health Act, took account of all relevant factors under the Code of Practice, properly focused on the application of the legislation to this patient rather than on broader issues, made findings of fact that were supported by the evidence and explained adequately why it had done so, taking an overall view. Read as a whole, its reasons explain how and why it came to the decision that there was treatment available to the patient (paragraph 42);
5.	while the tribunal is under a duty to comply with the right to a hearing stated in the European Convention on Human Rights and ensure an equality of arms as that is understood in the Strasbourg jurisprudence, the use by the tribunal of its own expertise is an important contribution to ensuring an equality of arms, reducing the need, which may exist in the court system, for the parties to have their own expert evidence (paragraph 47);
6.	the question whether treatment is “available” or “appropriate” and the boundary between containment and treatment are matters of fact and judgment for the tribunal exercising its judgment as an expert body (paragraph 48).

Special educational needs – child for whom local education authority responsible – continuation of statement beyond 19th birthday
MW had a statement of her special educational needs and became 19 in August 2008. The local education authority exercised its discretion to permit her to remain at her school beyond her 19th birthday but in March 2009 it wrote to her parents saying that it would cease to maintain her statement on 31 August 2009. The First-tier Tribunal struck out the father’s appeal on the basis that it had no jurisdiction because MW was no longer a child. In Part IV of the Education Act 1996, which deals specifically with special educational needs, “child” is defined as including any person who has not attained the age of 19 and is a registered pupil at a school. Schedule 27 to the Act, paragraph 9(2), allows a local education authority to cease to maintain a statement without notice of decision and a right of appeal where a child has ceased to be a child for whom it is responsible. The father appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal held*, citing R (Hill) v Bedfordshire County Council [2008] EWCA Civ 661; [2008] ELR 660, that the First-tier Tribunal had had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under paragraph 11(2)(b) of Schedule 27, which provides a right of appeal where an authority determines to cease to maintain a statement, and that the appellant’s daughter fell within the definition of a “child” in section 312(5), because, although she was over the age of 19 years, she was a registered pupil at a secondary school and pursuant to section 2(5) of the Act she was entitled to remain in her school until she had completed her course (which had no specific end date). The local education authority appealed to the Court of Appeal, citing R (B) v Islington [2010] EWHC 2539 (Admin).
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there was a crucial distinction between Hill and the present case in that in Hill the “child” came within the first limb in section 312(5) because he was under the age of 19 years, though he had ceased to be registered as a pupil at a school for the time being through no fault of his own (paragraph 34);
2.	section 312(5) does not contain a definition of “child” per se, rather it provides extended criteria for the purposes of Part IV only, and as such extends the definition of “child” to include those who are over 16 years and who have not yet reached 19 years. It was clear that Part IV was a distinct and separate part of the Act and that Parliament deliberately provided a very specific “definition” within that Part for a child with special needs. There was nothing irrational in drawing a distinction between children with special needs and others and it must be taken that Parliament intended the definition in Part IV to override the wording in section 2(5) (paragraphs 35 to 37);
3.	the conclusion in Islington was correct: section 312(5) is absolutely clear and should be interpreted in accordance with common usage. To construe the legislation in any other way would lead to absurdity. To refer to a young adult of 20 years or more as a “child” would be an impermissible corruption of language that is wholly unnecessary (paragraphs 38 to 43);
4.	it followed that the local authority had ceased to be responsible for MW and therefore was not bound to maintain the statement of special educational needs in respect of her. As the case fell squarely within paragraph 9(2) of Schedule 27 the local authority was not required to make a formal decision which was reviewable (paragraph 43).

Variation – assets – circumstances in which an asset will produce income which takes it out of the exception in regulation 18(3)(d) of the Variations Regulations
A nil maintenance calculation was made in respect of the non-resident parent father. The mother applied for a variation of that decision on the basis that the father held assets which fell within regulation 18 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000. A tribunal found that the father controlled the beneficial interest in properties which it valued at £1,100,000, but that he had no income from the properties taken as a whole (there being no taxable profit from his property management business). However, it decided that £800,000 of the capital assets should be taken into account under regulation 18 as those assets were not being retained for a reasonable purpose, thus falling outside the exception in regulation 18(3)(b). The father appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The point of law before the Upper Tribunal was how regulation 18(3)(d) of the Variations Regulations applied to the father’s property holding.  That regulation provides that an asset used in the course of a trade or business should not be taken into account under regulation 18 unless it is a “legal estate or beneficial interest in land and rights in or over land” which produces income not taken into account under Part III of the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a parent who is engaged in a business letting or managing property is a self-employed earner for the purposes of Part III of the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000: GD v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2008] UKUT 27 (AAC) followed (paragraph 22);
2.	when calculating net income from that business for the purposes of paragraphs 7 and 8 of Part III, “gross earnings” will not include income (such as rental income or other profit from land or property) which Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs would require to be entered into the “property” pages of a tax return. It will only include income that should be entered on the self-employment pages: CD v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2009] UKUT 48 (AAC) followed in preference to GD (paragraph 23);
3.	as a consequence, profits from beneficial interests in or rights over land do not fall within Part III and any such asset which produces income is not within the exception in regulation 18(3)(d) of the Variations Regulations. That asset will therefore be taken into account under regulation 18 for the purposes of deciding whether there should be a variation of the maintenance calculation, unless it comes within one of the other exceptions in regulation 18(3): GD not followed (paragraph 33);
4.	in deciding whether an asset produces income, the test is whether each asset considered individually produces gross receipts. The overall profitability of the business is ignored: CD not followed (paragraph 40);
5.	the tribunal gave inadequate reasons for its decision on the extent to which the father’s business assets fell within the exception in 18(3)(b).  The judge set out factors relevant to the question of whether property assets held by the father’s business were retained for a reasonable purpose (paragraph 47).
The case was a remitted to a new tribunal to investigate several issues.

Tribunal procedure – procedure where national insurance contribution issue arises on benefit appeal 
In 2001 the claimant was awarded a reduced state retirement pension on the basis that his contribution record showed that he had paid no national insurance contributions during the years 1974/75 to 1988/89. He appealed, asserting that the record was incorrect. After lengthy correspondence and several revisions to the calculation he appealed again in 2004. The contribution record question had not been referred to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) by the Secretary of State for a formal decision as laid down in regulation 11A of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 and so a tribunal chairman directed that the matter be referred to HMRC under regulation 38A of those Regulations for a decision against which the claimant could appeal to a tax tribunal. The retirement pension appeal was finally heard in December 2005 although no HMRC decision had been made and the Secretary of State had not provided a submission. The tribunal allowed the appeal and the Regional Chairman gave the Secretary of State permission to appeal as a matter of public interest so that the Secretary of State and/or HMRC could explain the procedures to the higher judiciary. HMRC made a decision in August 2006, against which the claimant appealed. The First-tier appeal against the contributions decision was heard at the same time and by the same judge as the appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision of December 2005 on the benefit question. On that appeal the judge found that the contribution record before him was on the balance of probabilities the correct record and confirmed the HMRC decision of August 2006. The First-tier decision is annexed to this report. The main issue in the Upper Tribunal case was the delays and impasses arising when it was necessary for a First-tier Tribunal (Social Entitlement Chamber) to refer a contribution question to HMRC. The Secretary of State and HMRC provided information about procedures to the Upper Tribunal judge and agreed the revised procedure set out in holding 2 below.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the social security tribunal took a decision it had no jurisdiction to take and the proper course of action was therefore to set aside its decision and replace it with the decision that the claimant’s entitlement to pension should be recalculated on the basis of the confirmed decision about his national insurance contribution record (paragraph 8);
2.	where a claimant appeals against a retirement pension decision and a contribution question arises, in most cases the tribunal will deal with the matter most quickly and efficiently if it directs its own officials to send a copy of its decision and directions to the National Insurance Contributions Office of HMRC (NICO) and ensure that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is informed of this and is invited to contact NICO direct about the reference if he so wishes. However, the tribunal should also consider if the case is one that should be sent to the Secretary of State rather than direct to NICO, for instance if further matters need clarifying before a reference is made. If so, then the tribunal should direct the Secretary of State to refer the matter, when it is ready for reference, to NICO (paragraphs 14 to 18).

Earnings and other income – equal treatment claims by local authority workers – whether lump sum payments in settlement income or capital
One-off lump sum payments were made by local authorities to the two appellants, their part-time employees, in order to settle claims for breaches of equal pay legislation over several years. In the first claimant’s case, her housing benefit was retrospectively re-assessed in the light of the payment she had received and repayment was sought from her in respect of the resulting overpayment. The claimant appealed to a First-tier Tribunal which held that the payment was income but not recoverable under the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. The Council appealed and the Upper Tribunal judge affirmed the decision that the payment was income because it was earnings under regulation 35(1) but held that it was recoverable (Kingston upon Hull CC v DM (HB) [2010] UKUT 234 (AAC)). On the claimant’s further appeal, it was accepted by all parties that if the payment was properly classified as income or arrears of income regulation 79(6) of the Housing Benefit Regulations had the effect of attributing the income to a period in the past. The second claimant was in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). She received a sum on account of an offer of settlement which she did not accept and this was assessed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as income for the purposes of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2006. On her appeal, the First-tier Tribunal held that the sum was not to be treated as income under regulation 98. The DWP appealed and the Upper Tribunal judge held that that the First-tier Tribunal was correct in deciding that the payment was not a compensation payment under regulation 98 but that it should have gone on to decide that it was nonetheless income rather than capital (SSWP v JP (JSA) [2010] UKUT 90 (AAC)). Both claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that, as the legislation did not define what payments were to be classified as “income” or “capital”, the words were to be given their ordinary meaning in the statutory scheme for housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance as sums paid to meet needs on a weekly basis calculated by reference to benefits in that week. The relevant Regulations only applied once the payment had been categorised as income or capital. The substantial one-off payments made to each of the employees viewed in this way did not have the characteristics of income and were not therefore income in the hands of the employees.
Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	in determining the true characteristic of the payment in the hands of the recipient for the purposes of the legislative scheme, the label that the parties attach to it is irrelevant, as is the method of settlement or the size of the payment in contrast to the weekly or monthly wages of the employee (paragraphs 21 to 23);
2.	the true characteristic of the payment to the first claimant was compensation for past lost income. Once this is identified, both statutory schemes are clear that the payments are income as opposed to capital. Under the Housing Benefit Regulations, as the payment was a payment of what should have been paid as wages, it fell within regulation 35. If it was not a payment of income within regulation 35, it must have been earnings within regulation 41(3) (paragraphs 25 to 28);
3.	the payment to the second claimant was similarly compensation for past lost income and under the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations, the on-account payment was earnings within regulation 98 and not excluded by the exception in regulation (98)(2) and therefore income under the Regulations. If not, it was earnings within regulation 104(4) (paragraph 31).

European Union law – Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 – whether state pension credit is a special non-contributory benefit which is not exportable
The claimant was in receipt of pension credit from its introduction in 2003, receiving both a guarantee credit and a savings credit. Section 1 of the State Pension Credit Act 2002 requires a claimant to be in Great Britain. In 2004 she moved permanently to Spain and payment of pension credit stopped. In 2008 she claimed a pension credit, and asked for any award to be back-dated to 1 March 2004. She said that she believed she was entitled to receive the benefit in Spain through the operation of European Union law. The claim was refused on the grounds that the benefit was not exportable and that the appellant was not resident in Great Britain. That decision was upheld on review and before the First-tier Tribunal. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. She argued that pension credit is exportable under Regulation 1408/71, because it is an old-age benefit within the scope of the Regulation and also that she had earned the right to the savings credit component through her savings for her own pension. The Secretary of State conceded that the appellant was within the personal scope of the Regulation, but argued that pension credit is a special non-contributory benefit listed in Annex IIa to Regulation 1408/71, whose payment can be restricted to persons in Great Britain by virtue of Article 10a. 
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	there is a prima facie case that pension credit is a special non-contributory benefit which cannot be exported from the United Kingdom as it is listed in Annex IIa (paragraphs 22 to 27);
2.	however, while listing of a benefit in Annex IIa is a necessary condition of being able to limit the exportability of a benefit under Article 10a, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has determined that such benefits may be examined to see whether they are properly included in Annex IIa as special non-contributory benefits: Case C-215/99 Jauch v Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Arbeiter  [2001] ECR I-1901 and Case C-43/99 Leclere and another v Caisse Nationale des Prestations Familiales [2001] ECR I-4265 (paragraph 28);
3.	pension credit is to be categorised as a special benefit as defined in Article 4(2a) since it is supplementary or ancillary to old-age benefits by reasons of the age qualifications for its payment and both guarantee credit and savings credit have strong features of social assistance in that they are means-tested (Case C-160/02 Skalka v Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Gewerblichen Wirtschaft [2004] ECR I-5613 and Case C-265/05 José Perez Naranjo v Caisse Régionale d’Assurance Maladie [2007] ECR I-347 followed) (paragraphs 40 and 41); 
4.	pension credit is to be categorised as a non-contributory benefit as defined in Article 4(2a) as entitlement is not dependent on the payment of contributions and there is no direct link in its funding to monies received by virtue of national insurance contributions (paragraphs 42 and 43);
5.	Regulation 883/2004, which replaced Regulation 1408/71 with effect from 1 May 2010, was not in effect at the material time and does not change the position in relation to the regime for special non-contributory benefits under Regulation 1408/71 (paragraph 45);
6.	pension credit is properly categorised as a special non-contributory benefit within Regulation 1408/71, and it follows that its payment can be limited to those living in Great Britain, and that the First-tier Tribunal reached the right conclusion, although its decision was inadequately reasoned (paragraphs 44, 50 to 52).

Tribunal procedure – jurisdiction – strike-out provisions
Special educational needs – child for whom local education authority responsible – cessation of statement where child seeks provision under section 319 but meanwhile enrols at further education college 
The appellant was the primary carer and person with parental responsibility for O, aged 16, who was severely dyslexic and dyscalculic. The local education authority had maintained a statement since 2005, in which the K Community School was named. In March 2009, following an appeal, the authority issued an amended statement, which continued to name the K Community School. O was at this point in Year 11 and the K Community School did not have pupils above Year 11. The appellant appealed against parts 2, 3 and 4 of the statement, contending that O should be placed at the Dyslexia Teaching Centre (DTC). The appellant’s advisers continued to pursue the appeal and O meanwhile enrolled in a further education college, effectively as a stop gap. Under Schedule 27 to the Education Act 1996, paragraph 9(1), a local education authority may not cease to maintain a statement except in accordance with paragraph 11, which provides for notice of decision and a right of appeal, but that is disapplied by paragraph 9(2) where a child has ceased to be a child for whom they are responsible. “Child” is defined in section 312 of the Act as including any person who has not attained the age of 19 and is a registered pupil at a school. The tribunal judge struck out the appeal under rule 8(3)(a) on the basis that O was no longer at a school and had therefore ceased to be a “child” within the relevant parts of the Act and the tribunal therefore did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal judge proceeded on the assumption that the Upper Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a decision to strike out under rule 8(3)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (HESC) Rules 2008, which was not disputed by the parties (and was held in [2010] AACR 35). 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	it is part of the ratio of  R (Hill) v Bedfordshire County Council [2008] EWCA Civ 661; [2008] ELR 660 that for the purposes of paragraphs 9 and 11 of Schedule 27, an extended meaning of “child” applies and that it is not decisive that the local authority is not, at the material time, “responsible” for the child within section 321 of the 1996 Act (paragraph 32);
2.	paragraph 108 of Hill is binding authority that where live issues between the parties remained and it was possible that, if an appeal went ahead, the tribunal might have made an order that special educational provision be provided by the local authority, that is sufficient to take the matter outside the scope of paragraph 9(2) (paragraph 34);
3.	if the First-tier Tribunal  judge was not applying Hill, but was rather relying on the mere fact of attendance at college as determining the issue, that was an error of law and if he was applying Hill, he was not entitled to conclude that there was no ongoing live issue, when the appellant was continuing to seek provision at the DTC for O (paragraphs 36 and 37);
4.	enrolling at college was a sensible step so that O would be doing something useful with his time whatever the outcome of the various uncertainties and a tribunal should be very reluctant to infer that he was thereby acceding to the local authority’s proposals (paragraph 38);
5.	the original direction in the First-tier Tribunal considered the possibility of an alternative basis of strike out under rule 8(4), but the Upper Tribunal was not asked to exercise it in the alternative and did not consider that it would be appropriate to do so (paragraph 43).

Tribunal practice – appeal to Court of Appeal – permission to appeal – grounds of appeal different from those argued before Upper Tribunal 
Incapacity for work – exceptional circumstances – allergy – correct approach to test of substantial risk to mental or physical health if found capable of work
The claimant suffered from a latex and rubber allergy. She had been successful before the First-tier Tribunal, which, contrary to the findings of the examining medical practitioner, found that she suffered from a specific disablement for the purposes of regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) General Regulations 1995 and that there was no work available for her which would be reliably safe. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal, which upheld the decision of the First-tier Tribunal ([2010] UKUT 127 (AAC)). The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on grounds of appeal which were significantly different from those argued before the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the Upper Tribunal lies only on a question of law, as does the appeal from the First-tier Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal (paragraph 3);
2.	permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the Upper Tribunal should be given only if the proposed appeal raises some important point of principle or practice or where there is some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard (paragraph 3);
3.	the Court of Appeal will always be mindful of the caution that it must exercise before substituting its own view for that of a specialist tribunal such as the Upper Tribunal: Cooke v Secretary of State for Social Security [2001] EWCA Civ 734 (reported as R(DLA) 6/01) and Napp Pharmaceuticals v DGFT [2002] EWCA Civ 796 approved (paragraphs 3 and 5);
4.	it was of concern that the grounds on which permission to appeal to the Court from the Upper Tribunal was given and which were relied on before the Court were not argued by the Secretary of State in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal. It was important when applying for permission to the Court that points of law or principle were specified by the appellant. In addition the appellant must state why these matters justify the attention of the Court. What had happened in this case was that grounds of appeal to the Court were put before the Upper Tribunal and the Judge was simply asked to certify them as important (paragraphs 17 and 32);
5.	the Secretary of State’s argument that the Upper Tribunal’s decision raised an important issue in relation to entitlement to incapacity benefit for many people suffering from allergies identified a matter of policy or convenience but did not identify any important point of principle or practice. This presented the Court with the difficulty that, if the point of law could not be identified, it could not reasonably interfere with the decisions below. In addition, a second appeal cannot be brought in respect of an important point of principle unless the point is one that is not yet established: Uphill v BRB (Residuary) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 60 cited with approval (paragraphs 21 and 22);
6.	the Court should be extremely slow in finding that, as specialist tribunals, the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal had failed properly to assess the case before them (paragraph 23);
7.	the Upper Tribunal had properly applied the approach in Charlton v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2009] EWCA Civ 42 (reported as R(IB) 2/09) in determining that if the claimant worked, she would be at risk on the basis that the Jobcentre had stated that it could see no prospect of her getting work that would be reliably safe for her. In the circumstances of this case, there was no need to hypothesise about types of work and whether the claimant would be reasonably safe (paragraph 29).

European Union Law – free movement of workers – application and interpretation of the worker registration scheme
The claimants were respectively nationals of the Czech Republic (M) and Poland (B). These states, together with six other states that acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004, are known as the A8 States. The Accession Treaty relating to those States permitted derogation from the rights of freedom of movement within the Community which the United Kingdom gave effect to in the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (the 2004 Regulations). The 2004 Regulations established a registration scheme under which workers from A8 States who wished to work were required to register with the authorities. There were exceptions in relation to certain persons who had been legally working in the UK on or before 30 April 2004. Both claimants had been granted admission to the United Kingdom before 1 May 2004, M as an asylum seeker and B under a temporary visa which had expired, after her marriage to a UK national, and their subsequent separation. Both had worked for certain periods after 1 May 2004 and both had claimed jobseeker’s allowance. Claims for income support then made by both claimants were rejected on the basis that they were “persons from abroad” fixed with a nil applicable amount for the purposes of calculating their entitlement under the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. “Persons from abroad” are defined as those not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland and a person is not to be treated as habitually resident in a territory unless he has a right to reside there. Under the Income Support Regulations certain categories of persons are not to be considered as “persons from abroad” including workers for the purposes of Council Directive No 2004/38/EC and those treated as “workers” for the purpose of the definition of “qualified person” in regulation 6(1) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations). The concept of “qualified person” was modified in relation to A8 nationals by the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (the 2004 Regulations). Workers from the A8 States were required to register employment, and would only be treated as a “worker”, and therefore be a “qualified person” with a right to reside, during a period in which they were working for an authorised employer ie in registered employment. Under regulation 2 of the 2004 Regulations a person ceased to be an accession State worker requiring registration, and was in the same position as other EU nationals, after 12 months continuous registered employment, or if they had already been, or had begun, legally working in the UK before 30 April 2004 for a continuous period of 12 months. Under regulation 2(7) of the 2004 Regulations a person was legally working if he had leave to remain and work in the UK. Appeals by M to an appeal tribunal and by B to the First-tier Tribunal were unsuccessful. Both appealed to the Upper Tribunal which found that the lower tribunals had not erred in law. The claimants appealed further to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing both appeals, that:

1.	the circumstances under which both claimants worked fell outside the definition of “legal employment” under regulation 2(7) of the 2004 Regulations; Case C-192/89 Sevince v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1990] ECR I-3461 applied (paragraphs 82 to 90);

2.	the provisions of the 2004 Regulations were not disproportionate: Zalewska v Department for Social Development [2008] UKHL 67 considered (paragraphs 46 to 49).

Tribunal procedure – case management of successive applications to First-tier Tribunal by patients subject to sections 2 and 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 – effect of community treatment order on reference to First-tier Tribunal
KF and MO were both admitted to hospital initially under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and both appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. Both patients were transferred to detention under section 3 of the 1983 Act before the expiry of their section 2 admissions. Both section 2 appeals were dismissed. KF appealed against her section 3 admission to the First-tier Tribunal after the section 2 hearing, but MO had appealed against her section 3 admission by the time her appeal was heard. Although there were errors of law in the tribunals’ decisions, the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and did not change the decisions on the basis that the challenges were “academic”, given that the patients had pending section 3 applications. The third appellant FF was admitted under section 3 and the hospital managers referred his case to the First-tier Tribunal. Before the reference could be heard, he was discharged under a community treatment order. The tribunal decided that the effect of that was that the reference ceased to have effect. FF applied for permission to appeal or a review of that decision. On 2 June 2009 the First-tier Tribunal decided to take no action as regards the review decision and refused permission to appeal. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal to all three appellants.
Held, allowing the appeals, but exercising its discretion so as not to set aside the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal, that:
1.	although the appeals to the Upper Tribunal were largely supported, there was good reason in the public interest for hearing them as there were important issues of principle, concerning the individual’s right to liberty, to be determined, one of the functions of the Upper Tribunal being to provide authoritative guidance to the First-tier Tribunal (paragraphs 3 to 6);
2.	if the First-tier Tribunal is asked to review a tribunal decision on a section 2 application, and concludes that it involves an error of law, then in general the appropriate way forward is for the First-tier Tribunal to set aside the substantive decision and to re-list the case for hearing together with any existing section 3 application, using the extensive case management powers now available under the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules (paragraphs 30 and 35);  
3.	under Article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights it remains incumbent upon the State to ensure that proper arrangements are in place for speedy hearings of detained patients’ applications and, in addition, the overriding objective under the HESC Rules of dealing with cases fairly and justly specifically includes “avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues” (rule 2(2)(e)) (paragraphs 31 to 34);
4.	where a patient seeks the tribunal’s consent to withdraw an appeal, the case will depend very much on the particular circumstances, and when considering such an application the First-tier Tribunal should always have regard to the overriding objective and its extensive case management powers (paragraphs 36 to 38);
5.	in MO’s case the tribunal had mistakenly applied the section 2 criteria in section 72(1)(a) rather than the section 3 criteria in section 72(1)(b), as required by R v South Thames Mental Health Review Tribunal, ex parte M [1998] COD 38 (paragraph 43);
6.	where the patient has been released, there will often be no individual or wider public interest in continuing proceedings, but it may remain appropriate for there to be further scrutiny of the initial First-tier Tribunal decision if there is a danger either that a future decision-maker may give inappropriate weight to a flawed decision or an urgent need for the legal principles at stake to be clarified (paragraphs 40 to 41);
7.	in AA v Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Trust [2009] UKUT 195 (AAC) it was held that an application to the First-tier Tribunal made while a patient is detained under section 3 does not lapse if the patient is discharged from hospital under section 17A, subject to a community treatment order, and the same principle applies to a reference to the First-tier Tribunal by hospital managers (paragraph 57).

Occupation of the home – whether child at university to be treated as occupier of parent’s home
The claimant was entitled to housing benefit and was living with her son who was a member of her family for housing benefit purposes. In September 2008 her son started university and was living in a hall of residence for the term of 12 weeks with the intention of returning home during vacations. As he was receiving the care component of disability living allowance he would have been eligible to claim housing benefit for his term-time accommodation under regulation 52(6) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, but did not do so. The local authority issued decision notices indicating reduced entitlement to housing benefit, on the basis that the son was no longer occupying the premises as his normal home and could not be included on the claimant’s claim as a non-dependant, so that the rent officer had been asked to determine a maximum eligible rent figure for a property with a bedroom for one person. Under regulation 14 of the 2006 Regulations a local authority may refer a rent to a rent officer where the number of occupiers of the dwelling has changed. Under regulation 7(1) a person shall be treated as occupying as his home the dwelling normally occupied as his home and shall not be treated as occupying any other dwelling as his home. Regulation 7(16) and (17) provides that a person who is temporarily absent from the dwelling he normally occupies as his home is to be treated as occupying that dwelling for any period of absence not exceeding 52 weeks if certain conditions are satisfied and regulation 7(13) deems a person to occupy the home during a temporary absence, where the absence is unlikely to exceed 13 weeks and there is an intention to return to the dwelling as the home. The claimant appealed. The tribunal disallowed the appeal, relying in particular on the provision in regulation 7(3) that a student claimant liable to make payments in respect of the dwelling occupied for the purposes of the course of study was to be treated as occupying that dwelling. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while the decision to refer the claimant’s rent to a rent officer was not itself appealable, it was  to be regarded as one component determination of several leading to and embodied in the “outcome” decision altering the amount of the claimant’s entitlement and so, in an appeal against that outcome decision, the tribunal was bound to consider afresh all those elements, including the local authority’s determination of the number of occupiers in the reference to a rent officer (R(IB) 2/04 and R(H) 2/08 followed) (paragraph 22);
2.	in the absence of a definition of “occupier” in the 2006 Regulations or the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) Order 1997 the starting point has to be regulation 7 of the Regulations (R v Housing Benefit Review Board for Swale Borough Council, ex parte Marchant [2000] 1 FLR 246; (2000) 32 HLR 856 followed) (paragraph 28);
3.	the fundamental test in regulation 7 remains whether the dwelling is occupied as the home, the question of whether the dwelling is normally so occupied being relevant to whether that test is deemed to be satisfied, and though regulation 7(6) is exhaustive of the circumstances in which a person can be treated as occupying two dwellings as the home when there is a liability to make payments in respect of both dwellings, other paragraphs of the regulation deeming a particular dwelling to be occupied as the home in certain circumstances may by implication disapply the one dwelling only rule (paragraph 29);
4.	regulation 7(13) directly deems a person to occupy a dwelling as the home, not normally to occupy, during a temporary absence, and so, while immediately before the beginning of the absence the person must have been normally occupying at least some part of the dwelling, what matters is the quality that the person’s occupation of the dwelling is intended to have when the intended return takes place (paragraph 31);
5.	there can be no underlying test of what is the normal home in applying paragraphs (13), (16) and (17) as there can only be a point to the existence of those paragraphs if they enable decision-makers and tribunals to avoid having to make the difficult value judgments about which dwelling is normally occupied, but instead to rely on answers to more factual and limited questions (R v Penwith District Council, ex parte Burt (1990) 22 HLR 292 ; CH/3014/2005 ; Stroud District Council v JG [2009] UKUT 67 (AAC), reported as R(H) 8/09 considered) (paragraph 32);
6.	it is implicit in regulation 7(13) and (16) and (17) that those provisions operate not only to cut through the issue of whether a person normally occupies a dwelling as his or her home, but also as an exception to the one dwelling only rule in regulation 7(1) (paragraph 37);
7.	it followed that, since his intention was to return in 12 weeks to occupy the claimant’s property as his home, her son was only temporarily absent from what he had been occupying as his home and was therefore to be treated as continuing to occupy it, and there was not a ground to authorise the local authority’s reference to a rent officer nor was there a relevant change of circumstances to ground a supersession of the existing award of housing benefit (paragraph 41).

Tribunal practice – review – whether original decision clearly wrong
The First-tier Tribunal directed a deferred conditional discharge of a restricted patient, the conditions including ones that the patient must reside in a named care home and must not leave its grounds except when supervised. The Secretary of State for Justice applied for permission to appeal on the ground that the conditions were unlawful. A judge of the First-tier Tribunal reviewed the decision and set it aside, referring the case to another panel. The patient applied for a review of the review decision or, alternatively, permission to appeal. The judge purported to review the review decision but to take no action in respect of it and refused permission to appeal. A renewed application for permission was refused by a judge of the Upper Tribunal on the ground that there was no right of appeal against a review decision. On reconsideration, the Chamber President treated the application as an application for permission to apply for judicial review of the last decision of the judge of the First-tier Tribunal and granted permission. 
Held, by a three-judge panel, quashing the last decision of the judge of the First-tier Tribunal, setting aside the decision to set aside the original decision and granting the Secretary of State permission to appeal against the original decision, that:
1.	the power to review a decision should be exercised only where the original decision was clearly wrong in law (paragraph 24);
2.	where the First-tier Tribunal re-decides a case following a review, its composition must be the same as was required for the original decision, although the particular judge and members may be different, and so there was no error in the judge referring the case to a different panel (paragraph 29);
3.	the judge had erred in concluding that the original decision was clearly erroneous in point of law, having failed to focus upon the need to avoid usurping the Upper Tribunal’s function of determining appeals on contentious points of law (paragraph 50).

Tribunal practice – extension of time for appeal – whether tribunal should have regard to CPR rule 3.9
The claimant, a child, and her siblings were placed in foster care by the Council. The claimant made an allegation of assault against her brother. The Crown Prosecution Service advised that there was not enough evidence to prosecute anyone. The Council made a claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) on her behalf. On 21 June 2007 CICA issued an assessment decision disallowing an award of compensation, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence. The Council applied for a review and on 19 March 2008 a letter was sent by CICA to the Council refusing to review. That letter was incorrectly addressed and did not come to the attention of the relevant case worker until December 2008. Under rule 22 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 an appeal is required to be made by sending notice of appeal to the tribunal “so that it is received within 90 days after the date of the decision being challenged”. The Council sent an appeal with additional evidence to CICA on 5 March 2009. CICA forwarded the letter and enclosed documents to the First-tier Tribunal, which on 19 March 2009 wrote to the case worker stating that the appeal was late, and enclosing a notice of appeal form, including a section for requesting an extension of the 90-day time limit. On 3 April 2009 the case worker replied enclosing a completed notice of appeal and giving reasons for lateness. The tribunal refused to admit the appeal. The claimant’s adoptive father made a claim for judicial review of that decision. It was argued on behalf of CICA that the correct approach for a tribunal judge who is considering whether to grant an extension of time for appealing is to have regard to the matters listed in rule 3.9 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
Held, refusing the claim for judicial review, that:
1.	there is no provision in the 2008 Rules in the terms of CPR rule 3.9, and it would not be appropriate to import it by way of analogy, as the tribunal’s power to extend time is unfettered and the circumstances which will be relevant in exercising the tribunal’s power to extend time will vary from case to case: R (Howes) v Child Support Commissioner [2007] EWHC 559 (Admin) cited (paragraphs 26 and 27);
2.	the judge was entitled to take the view that, in the light of the substantial delay (albeit explained and excusable) which had occurred down to 8 December 2008, the delay which occurred between then and 3 April 2009 was inexcusable and that in the particular circumstances of this case, where there had already been substantial delay, the notice of appeal could and should have been sent without additional evidence (paragraphs 37 to 39);
3.	it was sufficiently clear from the structure of the judge’s reasons that her conclusion was reached independently of the merits of the proposed appeal (paragraph 42);
4.	the judge’s exercise of the discretion was not wrong in law or flawed in a respect which permitted interference by way of judicial review (paragraphs 24, and 43).

Child support – variation of maintenance calculation – ability to control assets as a matter of Scots Law
The parent with care applied for a variation of a maintenance calculation. The decision-maker refused to make the variation. The First-tier Tribunal allowed her appeal and determined that the maintenance calculation should be varied under regulation 18(1)(a) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000. The tribunal determined that the non-resident parent had assets amounting to £104,300 in which he had a beneficial interest and which he also had the ability to control. These consisted of two heritable properties and three policies of insurance which were jointly owned by the parties and of which, by order of the Sheriff Court, the parent with care had been ordered to transfer her half interest to the non-resident parent. The non-resident parent appealed to the Upper Tribunal. 
Held, allowing the appeal and re-making the tribunal’s decision, that:
1.	in terms of regulation 18(1)(a) of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000, it is not necessary for a party to own a particular asset. The regulation merely requires that person to have the ability to control the asset (paragraph 9);
2.	at the material time, the parent with care owned her half share of the two heritable properties (which she had been ordered by the Sheriff to dispone to the non-resident parent) by virtue of the title in her name. Although it would have been open to the non-resident parent to apply to the Sheriff Clerk to grant a disposition in terms of section 5A of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1907 in order to obtemper the failure of the parent with care to do so, it could not be said that the ability to require a third party to do something with an asset to complete a title to it was consistent with the concept of having an ability to control it. Accordingly the tribunal had erred in finding that the two heritable properties were assets for the purposes of the regulation (paragraph 9);
3.	the insurance policies were not assets for the purposes of the regulation. The expression “chose in action” is a term of English law which is unknown in Scots Law (CCS/2499/2006 cited with approval). Without assignation to the non-resident parent of the interests of the parent with care in those policies, the non-resident parent could not surrender the policies in order to realise their value. It therefore could not be said that he had a beneficial interest in, or the ability to control, the half share of those policies owned by the parent with care until such time as her rights and interests had been assigned to him (paragraph 10);
4. 	the tribunal also failed to consider whether it would have been reasonable for the insurance policies to have been surrendered in order to realise their cash value. If it was reasonable for those assets to be retained to maturity, then the value of them would not count as part of his assets (paragraph 10);
5.	it followed that the appellant’s assets for the purposes of regulation 18(1) did not exceed the statutory limit and a case for variation had not been established (paragraph 12).

Meaning of the phrase “crime of violence” for the purposes of the Scheme 
Practice – weighing evidence and fact finding – the function and relationship between tribunals and appellate courts 
On 18 January 2005 the respondent, Mr Jones, was driving a lorry along the inside lane of a carriageway. Ahead of him, in the central lane, was another lorry. Ahead of both of these vehicles was a car which was parked on the hard shoulder of the carriageway. As the leading lorry approached the car a man, Mr Hughes, ran into the middle of the central lane. Despite braking, the driver hit Mr Hughes, killing him instantly (the inference was that Mr Hughes’ intention was to kill himself). As the leading lorry braked it swerved into the path of Mr Jones’ lorry. Mr Jones was so severely injured in the resultant collision that he needed full-time care. An application was made on his behalf to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (the CICA) for compensation. The CICA refused Mr Jones’ claim on the grounds that he was not a victim of a criminal injury, defined in the relevant Scheme as an injury directly attributable to “a crime of violence”. Mr Jones appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (the F-tT) on the ground, among others, that Mr Hughes had inflicted grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The F-tT dismissed this aspect of the appeal as it was not satisfied that Mr Hughes intended to cause harm, or was reckless as to whether harm might be caused by his actions. Mr Jones applied to the Upper Tribunal for relief by way of judicial review of the F-tT’s decision. The Upper Tribunal accepted that the mens rea for an offence under section 20 of the 1861 Act was that the defendant either intended or foresaw that his act would cause harm to some person: R v Savage; DPP v Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 699, 752 per Lord Ackner. It held that the F-tT had properly directed itself to the question it had to consider, and that its finding, that Mr Hughes was not reckless, was reasonable. Mr Jones was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and granted judicial review of the F-tT’s decision, remitting the matter to a differently constituted F-tT to reconsider the case in the light of its judgment. The CICA appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	built into the phrase “a crime of violence” are two questions which the F-tT had to consider. The first was whether, having regard to the facts which had been proved, a criminal offence had been committed. That question is for the tribunal, having informed itself as to what the law requires for proof of that offence, to determine as a matter of fact. The second was whether, having regard to the nature of the criminal act, the offence that was committed was a crime of violence. This may also raise an issue of fact for the tribunal to determine depending on what the law requires for proof of the offence. The range of acts that fall within the broad definition may vary quite widely, so the question whether there was a crime of violence would have to be determined by looking at the nature of what was done. But in this case the words of the statute admit of only one answer. They speak for themselves. To wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm on another person unlawfully or recklessly, foreseeing that physical harm to some other person will be the consequence of his act, is a crime in terms of section 20. So too is the unlawful or reckless application of physical force of any kind to the person, directly or indirectly, so that they suffer injury. The crime that section 20 defines will always amount to a crime of violence for the purposes of the Scheme (paragraphs 16 to 18);
2.	the appeal to the F-tT failed because it was not proved to the tribunal’s satisfaction that a section 20 offence had been committed. The F tT appreciated that the question it had to consider first was whether an offence under section 20 had been committed. It identified correctly the tests that had to be applied and reached the conclusion that it was not satisfied that such an offence was committed. It did not go on to consider whether a crime of violence had been committed within the meaning of the Scheme because, having concluded that no crime was committed, it did not have to do so. The F-tT having examined the nature of the act, rather than its consequences, concluded that there was no hostile act directed towards a person who suffered injury as a result and it was not satisfied that Mr Hughes actually foresaw that his behaviour might cause physical harm to others. So it was not persuaded that he had the necessary mens rea of recklessness to bring his actions within a section 20 offence. The Upper Tribunal made it clear in its judgment that the F-tT’s reasoning should be read in this way and that its finding was reasonable (paragraph 20);
3.	 the Court of Appeal failed to identify a flaw in the reasoning of the F-tT which could be said to amount to an error of law (paragraphs 26);
4.	the interpretation and application of a specialised statutory scheme having been entrusted by Parliament to the new tribunal system, an important function of the Upper Tribunal is to develop structured guidance on the use of expressions which are central to the scheme, so as to reduce the risk of inconsistent results by different panels at the F-tT. It was primarily for the tribunals, not the appellate courts, to develop a consistent approach to such issues as to whether the words “a crime of violence” did or did not apply to the facts which had been proved. This is something which they are peculiarly well fitted to determine. A pragmatic approach should be taken to the dividing line between law and fact, so that the expertise of tribunals at the F-tT and that of the Upper Tribunal can be used to best effect. An appeal court should not venture too readily into this area by classifying issues as issues of law which are really best left for determination by the specialist appellate tribunals (paragraph 16 and 41).

Tribunal procedure – Upper Tribunal – enforcement reference 
A district judge of the First-tier Tribunal issued a direction under rule 16 of the SEC Rules containing a summons for a doctor to attend the hearing of the claimant’s disability living allowance appeal. The doctor had failed to respond, because of an administrative error by his surgery staff, to an earlier direction requiring him to produce the claimant’s medical records. Neither the doctor nor the appellant was present at the hearing but the appeal was allowed. A regional tribunal judge made an enforcement reference to the Upper Tribunal under section 25 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and rule 7(3) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008. There had been errors in the name and address of the doctor in the document and the Upper Tribunal accepted that he had not received the summons.
Held, making no order on the reference, that:
1.	rule 6(4) of the SEC Rules requires written notice of any direction to be sent to any person affected by the direction, and section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 deems a document to be effectively served by post only if it is properly addressed and so the failure of the doctor to comply with a notice he had not received could not conceivably warrant the exercise of powers under section 25 of the 2007 Act (paragraph 13);
2.	an order to compel a practising doctor to attend a hearing should not be made without a very compelling reason but in this case there was no indication of why the tribunal considered that such an order was a necessary and proportionate response to the doctor’s apparent failure to comply with the previous directions (paragraph 15);
3.	the tribunal should have investigated the possibility of proceeding without the records before issuing the summons and should have investigated whether the letter had actually been delivered to the doctor’s address before deciding to refer the matter to the Upper Tribunal (paragraphs 15 and 16);
4.	care must be taken to follow proper procedures both before a tribunal decides to make a reference and once such a decision is made, and in this case the tribunal had erred in making a reference that was reserved to the Chamber President in breach of paragraph 10 of the Senior President’s Practice Statement on Composition of Tribunals and in failing to make any provision in the summons for the payment of  the doctor’s expenses in  breach of rule 16(2)(b) ((paragraphs 17 and 18);
5.	tribunals must make clear in plain English what things must be done and the possible consequences of any failure to do what the tribunal has required, and it is highly desirable that a statement under rule 16(4)(b) of the SEC Rules should spell out the penalties that may be imposed for failure to comply (paragraph 19);
6.	the Upper Tribunal reserved for the future the question of whether a party other than the alleged contemnor can make representations in a section 25 case, accepting that it would be more appropriate for that issue to be considered and decided in a case where a party had substantive representations to make (paragraphs 23 and 24).

Prescribed disease A4 – task-specific focal dystonia – meaning of “task-specific” – whether includes cervical dystonia
The claimant suffered from cervical torticollis, a form of focal dystonia, brought on by frequent turning of her neck and upper body to use a computer in her work behind the counter of a building society. Her claim for industrial injuries disablement benefit was refused on the ground that her condition did not fall within the list of diseases or personal injuries prescribed in Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985. She appealed and the First-tier Tribunal allowed her appeal, holding that her condition fell within the wording of the prescription of prescribed disease A4 “Task-specific focal dystonia”, which was substituted from 6 April 2007 for “Cramp of the hand or forearm due to repetitive movements”, following a report of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal, arguing that a “task-specific focal dystonia” in the sense in which those words were used in the regulation would only affect the hand or forearm and as the tribunal clearly recorded that the claimant’s hands and arms were not affected, the terms of the prescription of the disease could not be satisfied. It was accepted that her work brought her within the occupational part of the prescription in the Schedule and that her work caused her disability. The judge heard medical evidence and considered medical literature on the meaning of “task-specific focal dystonia”.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in a specialised medical context such as this, the term “task-specific” refers to dystonic conditions which relate to muscles involved in performing skilled fine motor tasks, not as a general term so as to include dystonias that relate to the larger, less specific or finely-controlled muscular movements (paragraphs 19 to 23);
2.	it is legitimate to draw at least some inference as to the intended scope of the reference to “task-specific” in the description of the disease from the actual occupational tasks identified for the purposes of the prescription, as referring to the kind of movements and actions specific to those occupational activities and not to anything more general (paragraph 24);
3.	the prescribed disease had throughout its long history been concerned with conditions accepted as related to the performance of finely-controlled repetitive movements and the terms of the report which led to the introduction of the 2007 rewording left no doubt that the only aspect of the existing wording sought to be addressed by the introduction of the amendment was the removal of the risk of ambiguity from the use of the old term “cramp”, which was considered to require replacing by more up-to-date medical terminology (paragraphs 25 to 29);
4.	cervical dystonia of the kind suffered by the claimant was therefore not within the true scope of disease A4 “Task-specific focal dystonia” as prescribed from April 2007 (paragraph 18);
5.	if the effect of the amendment to the prescription of prescribed disease A4 in 2007 were to extend the scope of the prescription to include cervical dystonia, the whole amendment would have to be held invalid for failure to comply with the statutory preconditions of the Secretary of State’s power to make the statutory instrument, since there was no evidence and no basis in the Council’s report for him to be satisfied that the prescription should be extended to that particular type of focal dystonia (paragraphs 29 and 30).

Housing benefit – maximum rent and occupation of the home – meaning of “occupier” for local housing allowance purposes – shared care of child – whether foster child occupier of home
(Note: Regulation 21(3) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 was amended with effect from 1 November 2011 by SI 2010/2449 to reverse the effect of this decision in relation to foster children.)
The appeals in CH/1608/2009 and CH/3000/2009 concerned whether a child who is the subject of a fostering arrangement under section 23(2)(a) of the Children Act 1989 should be taken into account in determining the number of bedrooms to be reflected in the calculation of a claimant’s local housing allowance (LHA) for housing benefit purposes. The appeal in CH/247/2010 concerned the treatment for LHA purposes of a child who spent equal time with each of two separated parents. In all cases there was no dispute that under regulation 12A of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 the maximum rent was the local housing allowance determined by the rent officer. By regulation 13D (introduced from 7 April 2008) the level of the allowance fell to be calculated by reference to the number of bedrooms to which the claimant was entitled in accordance with regulation 13D(3). Regulation 20 of the 2006 Regulations provides that where a child or young person spends equal amounts of time in different households, or where there is a question as to which household he is living in, he shall be treated as normally living with the person who is receiving child benefit in respect of him. Regulation 21(3) provides that certain foster children placed with a claimant or his partner under Children Act 1989 or other relevant legislation shall not be treated as members of the claimant’s household. It was submitted for the claimants in all three cases that the LHA system introduced by regulations 13C and 13D contained a self contained provision, so that the question of who were “occupiers” within 13D(12) was a matter of fact. In CH/1608/2009 and CH/3000/2009 it was argued that if regulation 13D did not create a self-contained test, and one had to apply the regulation in the context of the 2006 Regulations as a whole, then regulation 7 on its true construction still meant that foster children were to be taken into account. 
Held, dismissing the appeal (by the local authority) in CH/1608/2009 and that in CH/247/2010 and allowing the appeal (by the claimant) in CH/3000/2009, that:
1.	there was nothing in regulation 13D that suggests that it was intended to create a self-contained provision, and so it did not introduce a significantly different approach to when a person occupies a dwelling as his or her home from that taken by the Court of Appeal in R v Swale BC ex parte Marchant [2000] 1 FLR 246; (2000) 32 HLR 856, where it was held that the scope of regulation 5 (the predecessor to regulation 7) was not limited to considering a claimant’s benefit entitlement (paragraphs 22 and 23);
2.	since Swale is binding authority on the Upper Tribunal, it followed that the appeal in CH/247/2010 must fail as regulation 20 fell to be applied and the child was to be treated for the purposes of regulation 13D as normally living not with the claimant, but with her father, who was in receipt of child benefit, and therefore within the “family” of her father; and so, by regulation 7, treated as occupying as her home the home normally occupied by that “family” (paragraph 24);
3.	since, by virtue of regulation 21(3)(a), a child who is fostered is not to be treated as a member of the claimant’s household, he or she cannot fall within the core definition of “family” in section 137 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act and consequently the words in regulation 7(1)(a), which address only where a person “is a member of a family”, have no applicability and a foster child must be treated in accordance with the remainder of regulation 7 as occupying as his or her home the dwelling he or she normally occupies (paragraphs 25 to 27);
4.	the exclusion effected by regulation 21(3) from the “household” is a limited one, and must be taken to have been chosen advisedly and it could not be implied into the detailed drafting of regulation 13D that the word “child” in paragraph (3) referred in context to a child who was a member of the claimant’s household (which would exclude foster children) (paragraph 29).

Computation of earnings – salaried employee becoming part-time – whether payment in respect of month of transition to be treated as two separate payments 
The claimant was in full-time salaried employment and was paid in respect of each calendar month on the last banking day of that month. His mother was seriously ill and he arranged to work part-time with earnings just under £95 per week from Monday 3 March 2008 so as to be able to care for her. He claimed carer’s allowance in advance of that date. Under section 70 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, a person could be entitled to carer’s allowance if not gainfully employed and entitlement could continue for eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for. Regulation 8(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 provided that a person should be treated as gainfully employed on every day in a benefit week (starting on a Monday) if his earnings in the immediately preceding week exceeded £95. The claimant’s payslip for March 2008 showed that he was paid his full salary for the first two days of the month with the result that his earnings averaged over the month exceeded £95 per week and the decision-maker therefore disallowed his claim. In May the claimant was awarded benefit from Monday 5 May 2008 on the basis of his April payslip, but his mother had died on 4 May 2008, and the award was revised and it was decided that he was not entitled to carer’s allowance at all. He appealed. The First-tier Tribunal initially decided that the claimant was entitled to carer’s allowance from 30 April 2008 to 1 June 2008 and, subject to confirmation of his earnings in May 2008, also from 2 June 2008 to 29 June 2008 but the Secretary of State sought permission to appeal and a district tribunal judge set the decision aside and referred the case to the Upper Tribunal under section 9(5)(b) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The claimant argued that, as his contract of employment referred to weekly hours of work, the payments made in his case should be treated as each being a number of payments made in respect of single weeks, as in CG/607/2008, and carer’s allowance should therefore have been awarded from 14 April to 29 June. 

Held, dismissing the appeal:
1.	the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996 had the effect that, if paid in respect of a month, the salary payment received by the claimant on Monday 31 March 2008 was to be treated as earnings from that date until 27 April, and regulation 8(1) of the 1976 Regulations had the effect that the earnings taken into account in each of those four weeks affected entitlement to a carer’s allowance in each of the following weeks, so that  the payment affected the claimant’s entitlement to carer’s allowance right up to the date his mother died on 4 May 2008 (paragraphs 13 and 14);
2.	the present case was distinguishable from CG/607/2008 because in that case the payments made each month were calculated on the basis of the number of hours worked in that month whereas here the claimant was salaried so that treating the payments as monthly payments under the 1996 Regulations worked perfectly satisfactorily except, arguably, in March 2008 (paragraphs 15 and 16);
3.	the March 2008 payment could not be treated as two payments, one for two days and the other for 29 days, because monthly payments should not too readily be treated as composed of, or including, payments for shorter periods and the fact that regulation 8(3) of the Computation Regulations allowed flexibility in cases of fluctuating earnings only if the amount “has changed more than once” was a clear indication that an anomaly due to a single variation was regarded as tolerable and was to be disregarded in the interests of administrative convenience (paragraphs 17 to 21).

Human rights – funeral payment – whether statutory scheme discriminatory contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in case of Jewish funeral
The claimant, who was a solicitor, was an executor of the will of the deceased and took responsibility for the funeral arrangements. The deceased was Jewish but at the time of his death was not a member of a synagogue or burial society. At the time of death it was not clear whether the estate had sufficient funds to pay for a funeral, but Jewish law required a prompt burial and the local synagogue authorities agreed that he would be buried in their cemetery according to orthodox Jewish practice. In the event the estate was insolvent. The claimant made a late claim for a funeral payment under section 7 of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 2005. The Secretary of State refused the payment. The claimant appealed. The tribunal found that he was the responsible person and that it was reasonable for him to accept responsibility for the funeral expenses but dismissed the appeal because he was not in receipt of one of the means-tested benefit listed in regulation 4. The claimant appealed further. Before the Upper Tribunal it was common ground that, subject to arguments about irrationality and human rights law, the claimant could not be entitled to the payment as the domestic legislation and regulations stood. His contention was that the funeral payments scheme as made under sections 138(1) and 175 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act was irrational because it had not provided for a personal representative to be eligible for a payment in the case of an insolvent estate or allowed for an appropriate exemption from the qualifying benefit requirement or that there had been a breach of Article 14 when read with Article 9 because the scheme had a disproportionately prejudicial effect on a particular group defined by religion.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the funeral payments scheme is provided under the authority of social security legislation to help alleviate financial hardship in relevant cases and is a rational workable scheme, made within the authority of the legislation, albeit with limitations and exclusions, which may be frustrating but that comes nowhere near affecting the validity of the regulations (paragraphs 54 and 55); 
2.	the operation of the scheme engaged Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life) (Esfandiari and Others v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2006] EWCA Civ 282, reported as R(IS) 11/06) and Article 9 (the freedom to manifest religion or belief) but did not breach either Article (paragraphs 61 and 63);
3.	there was no direct discrimination as the statutory scheme applied to people of all religions and no religion alike and there was nothing in the scheme that prevented the burial of the deceased in accordance with his religious views (paragraph 66 to 68);
4.	it was clear that in relation to entitlement to a payment from the social fund for funeral expenses, the claimant was treated differently from the way in which a person who was entitled to one of the qualifying benefits would have been treated but there is only discrimination for the purposes of Article 14 if the difference in treatment does not pursue a legitimate aim or is disproportionate to the aim pursued (paragraphs 69 to 71);
relative wealth is not one of the “suspect” grounds listed by Lord Hoffman in paragraph 15 of R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37 and in the present case the difference in treatment was not demeaning to the claimant and did not deprive him of entitlement to equal respect, but it did require rational justification, and that consisted in the policy of the State to focus financial assistance on those of more limited means, which policy had been implemented in a proportionate manner (paragraph 72).

Remunerative work – seasonal self-employment – calculation of earnings
The claimant was self-employed and worked from March to November each year, usually claiming income-based jobseeker’s allowance in the winter. His claim in November 2008 was refused and he appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The tribunal applied CIS/166/1994 and concluded that there was a clear pattern of employment and self-employment and that the claimant’s business was an established and going concern. It therefore held that his earnings should be averaged over a year and that his weekly income, on the basis of his earnings for the 2007 season, exceeded his applicable amount, so that he was not entitled to jobseeker’s allowance. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. Under section 1(2)(e) of the Jobseekers Act 1995 a claimant is entitled to jobseeker’s allowance only if he “is not engaged in remunerative work”, defined in regulations 51 to 53 of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 as work done for not less than 16 hours on average. For income-based jobseeker’s allowance, regulation 95(1)(a) provides for the earnings of a self-employed earner to be averaged over a year for the purposes of determining whether his income exceeds his applicable amount. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to the 1996 Regulations provides that, in the calculation of earnings, in the case of a claimant who has been engaged in remunerative work or part-time employment as a self-employed earner and who has ceased to be so employed, from the date of the cessation of his employment there are to be disregarded any earnings derived from that employment.
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to the same effect, that:
1.	paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to the 1996 Regulations refers to an outright cessation rather than an interruption and, while it is necessary, for the purpose of applying regulation 95 to a non-working period (whether seasonal or not), to decide whether self-employment has or has not ceased within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Schedule 6, it is unnecessary to consider whether a person is “in gainful employment” despite doing no work. The decision of the House of Lords in Banks v Chief Adjudication Officer [2001] UKHL 33 (reported as R(IS) 15/01) and more recent reported decisions such as R(JSA) 1/03 and JC v SSWP [2008] UKUT 40 (AAC), reported as R(JSA) 1/09 should be followed in preference to CIS/166/1994 (paragraphs 17 to 19);
2.	it is not an implicit precondition of regulation 95(1) itself that the claimant remains in self-employment and tribunals should treat the question whether earnings from an active period are relevant to a claim period as simply a matter of applying paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 (paragraphs 21 and 22);
3.	on the tribunal’s findings, the claimant did not cease self-employment in November 2008 but merely entered into a cyclical period of not working and so his earnings in the year ending with the first week of his claim were to be taken into account pursuant to regulation 95(1)(a) (paragraph 23);
4.	it is not an error of law for a tribunal to fail to consider whether a claimant’s hours of work exceed the threshold for “remunerative work” if it is satisfied that the claim fails on earnings grounds (paragraph 26);
5.	however, unless a claim fails on earnings grounds, it is an error of law for a tribunal to fail to make a finding on average hours of work merely because there is no suggestion in the papers that the threshold is exceeded (paragraph 28);
6.	although the tribunal correctly looked at the claimant’s earnings over a year, it looked at the wrong period. However his earnings calculated over the correct period still exceeded the applicable amount and he was not entitled to jobseeker’s allowance (paragraph 29).

Earnings and other income – equal treatment claims by local authority workers – whether lump sum payments in settlement income or capital
One-off lump sum payments were made by local authorities to the two appellants, their part-time employees, in order to settle claims for breaches of equal pay legislation over several years. In the first claimant’s case, her housing benefit was retrospectively re-assessed in the light of the payment she had received and repayment was sought from her in respect of the resulting overpayment. The claimant appealed to a First-tier Tribunal which held that the payment was income but not recoverable under the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. The Council appealed and the Upper Tribunal judge affirmed the decision that the payment was income because it was earnings under regulation 35(1) but held that it was recoverable (Kingston upon Hull CC v DM (HB) [2010] UKUT 234 (AAC)). On the claimant’s further appeal, it was accepted by all parties that if the payment was properly classified as income or arrears of income regulation 79(6) of the Housing Benefit Regulations had the effect of attributing the income to a period in the past. The second claimant was in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). She received a sum on account of an offer of settlement which she did not accept and this was assessed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) as income for the purposes of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2006. On her appeal, the First-tier Tribunal held that the sum was not to be treated as income under regulation 98. The DWP appealed and the Upper Tribunal judge held that that the First-tier Tribunal was correct in deciding that the payment was not a compensation payment under regulation 98 but that it should have gone on to decide that it was nonetheless income rather than capital (SSWP v JP (JSA) [2010] UKUT 90 (AAC)). Both claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that, as the legislation did not define what payments were to be classified as “income” or “capital”, the words were to be given their ordinary meaning in the statutory scheme for housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance as sums paid to meet needs on a weekly basis calculated by reference to benefits in that week. The relevant Regulations only applied once the payment had been categorised as income or capital. The substantial one-off payments made to each of the employees viewed in this way did not have the characteristics of income and were not therefore income in the hands of the employees.
Held, dismissing the appeals, that:
1.	in determining the true characteristic of the payment in the hands of the recipient for the purposes of the legislative scheme, the label that the parties attach to it is irrelevant, as is the method of settlement or the size of the payment in contrast to the weekly or monthly wages of the employee (paragraphs 21 to 23);
2.	the true characteristic of the payment to the first claimant was compensation for past lost income. Once this is identified, both statutory schemes are clear that the payments are income as opposed to capital. Under the Housing Benefit Regulations, as the payment was a payment of what should have been paid as wages, it fell within regulation 35. If it was not a payment of income within regulation 35, it must have been earnings within regulation 41(3) (paragraphs 25 to 28);
3.	the payment to the second claimant was similarly compensation for past lost income and under the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations, the on-account payment was earnings within regulation 98 and not excluded by the exception in regulation (98)(2) and therefore income under the Regulations. If not, it was earnings within regulation 104(4) (paragraph 31).

Tribunal practice – direction barring teacher from work with children – nature of appeal – admissible evidence
In 1984 the appellant had been convicted of crimes of violence against his partner and her child. In 2003 he was prosecuted on three charges of indecent assault on boys, but was found not guilty at the Crown Court. The Secretary of State made a direction under section 142 of the Education Act 2002 (since repealed by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 except for transitional cases) barring him from carrying out any work providing education or involving contact with children by placing him on the list kept under section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1999 of individuals considered unsuitable to work with children (known as List 99). He appealed and the First-tier Tribunal allowed his appeal, concluding that the Secretary of State’s direction was not proportionate. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal. At no stage in the proceedings was the indictment and/or the transcript of the criminal trial produced. Regulation 13(2) of the Education (Prohibition from Teaching or Working with Children) Regulations 2003 provided that the First-tier Tribunal shall not in exercising its power under this regulation consider any information relevant to the decision which the Secretary of State did not have at the time the decision was made. However rule 15(2)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008 provides that the First-tier Tribunal may admit evidence whether or not it would be admissible in a civil trial in England and Wales or it was available to a previous decision-maker.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	within the limitations of the provisions on what information, evidence or material the tribunal can take into account, the First-tier Tribunal is under a duty to make its own findings of fact insofar as the relevant and necessary facts are disputed and, on the basis of those findings and the agreed facts, to make its own judgment in respect of the statutory questions: Secretary of State v Kevin Philliskirk [2008] EWHC 2838 (Admin), Ofsted v GM and WM [2009] UKUT 89 (AAC); [2010] AACR 21 and MC v SSD [2009] UKUT 173 (AAC); [2010] AACR 20 followed (paragraphs 17 to 28);
2.	the object of regulations 12(2) and 13(2) appears to be to enable the Secretary of State to consider the significance of any new information or change of circumstances before the tribunal does, not to prevent a tribunal from receiving more detailed evidence about an issue raised in information that has previously been before the Secretary of State and it is a matter of judgment whether more detailed evidence received at a hearing before a tribunal amounts to new information for the purposes of regulation 13(2)(a) (paragraphs 31 to 33);
3.	if either of the parties wished to rely on what happened at the trial it would be for that party to seek to put these materials in evidence; those materials would not amount to new information, but would be detailed evidence of information which was before the Secretary of State. However, the interest of justice and fair procedure would require that both parties had a full opportunity to consider that information for a reasonable period prior to the new hearing before the First-tier Tribunal (paragraph 34);
4.	the question of whether a teacher should be the subject of a direction in these circumstances has to be viewed in the context of restricting a person’s employment for the purposes of both the protection of children and the maintenance of public confidence in the education system and in that context the tribunal’s reasoning was flawed in relation both to the weight given to the convictions and to the evidential value of the similarity of the later allegations (paragraphs 38 to 40).
The judge referred the matter to a differently constituted tribunal in the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing and decision in accordance with his directions.

Criminal injuries compensation – reduction and withholding of awards – conduct of applicant – when behaviour causing or contributing to the incident makes it inappropriate to award full compensation
The claimant made a claim under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2001, stating that she had suffered an unprovoked assault in a named cinema and had reported the assault to a police officer. The police description of the incident recounted that, before the film had started, she began to blow a whistle if people talked or used a mobile telephone. Under paragraph 13(d) of the Scheme, a claims officer of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) may withhold or reduce an award where he considers that the conduct of the claimant before, during or after the incident giving rise to the application makes it inappropriate that a full award or any award at all be made. A claims officer made a decision that an award could not be made under the Scheme, because it would be inappropriate in view of the information from the police showing that the claimant’s conduct had provoked the incident. The claimant applied for a review of that decision, saying that the police description bore no relationship to the true sequence of events. On review the claims officer said that there was conflicting evidence, but not enough to be satisfied that the claimant’s conduct did not contribute to what happened, so that a full or reduced award of compensation would be inappropriate under paragraph 13(d). The claimant appealed. The tribunal disallowed the appeal on the basis that it was satisfied that the weight of the available evidence was that the applicant had acted in an unusual, unreasonable and provocative manner, that it was her behaviour that had brought about the incident in question and that “accordingly” it was unable to make any award. The claimant applied to the Upper Tribunal for judicial review. When giving permission to appeal, the Chamber President of the Administrative Appeals Chamber (AAC), “without limiting the grounds that may arise”, drew attention to a number of points, including whether the tribunal had failed to ask the right question. It was part of CICA’s submission that that ground should not be considered, as it had not formed an express part of the case made for the claimant.

 Held, allowing the application and quashing the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, that:
1.	the mere identification of a number of grounds on which permission is granted or on which submissions are directed, without a formal limitation of the giving of permission to those specific grounds, does not exclude the consideration of any issue that is relevant to the question of whether one of the orders specified in section 15(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 should be made and, in order to ensure that the correct result in law is reached, issues may be raised by the AAC itself at any stage, subject always to the principles of natural justice (paragraph 15);
2.	the tribunal’s use of the word “accordingly” indicated that it regarded the decisive test as whether the claimant’s behaviour had brought about the incident in question, which was not to ask the question in the terms of paragraph 13(d), but to ask a different question that was apparently regarded as conclusive and so to fetter its very wide discretion (paragraph 17);
3.	R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Comerford, 19 June 1980, is authority that the occurrence of unforeseeably severe consequences of violence is irrelevant to paragraph 13(d), but it is no authority at all on a situation where a claimant’s conduct is provocative not of the very blow that followed, but of no violent reaction at all or of a reaction of a lower degree of violence than actually occurred and the tribunal and CICA are entitled to take into account when assessing appropriateness that some degree of violent reaction could have been anticipated, but the actual reaction (as opposed to the consequences of that reaction) was out of proportion to what was expected (paragraphs 27 to 30);
4.	it cannot be said that applying that approach  must have produced the same outcome as that reached by the tribunal asking itself too restricted a question, as there was plainly an argument for the claimant that no matter how annoying, disruptive and provocative the actions that the tribunal found she carried out were, they could not reasonably have been expected to result in a reaction of violence (paragraph 31);
5.	in the light of the importance now given to the adequacy of reasons as an element of a fair trial, nothing in R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Cook [1996] 1 WLR 1037 can be allowed to take anything away from the standard of reasons required of a First-tier Tribunal and  the tribunal’s reasons here did not come up to the standard required by those general principles as re-stated in South Bucks District Council v Porter (No 2) [2004] UKHL 33; [2004] 1 WLR 1953, as there needed to be some further explanation of why the nature of the claimant’s conduct made it inappropriate for something less than a full award to be made (paragraph 35);
6.	if a tribunal wishes to rely on the way similar cases have been dealt with in the past as part of the explanation for a conclusion on inappropriateness (not as a substitute for such a conclusion) it needs to say so expressly (paragraph 37).	

The judge remitted the case to a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal within the Social Entitlement Chamber for reconsideration.

Housing costs – long tenancy – rent payable under Ijarah method of financing house purchase – whether qualifies for housing costs
The claimant became entitled to income-based jobseeker’s allowance and at the end of the statutory waiting period of 39 weeks asked for housing costs to be taken into account in the calculation. He was making payments under the Shari’a-compliant Ijarah method, by which the bank had purchased the property and granted him a 25-year tenancy while he was obliged to pay rent and “payments on account” with the right to acquire ownership once “on account” payments equalled the purchase price. In March 2007 the decision-maker refused on the ground that no interest was payable. The claimant appealed on the ground that he was making rental payments that were equivalent to mortgage interest. The appeal tribunal in May 2008 allowed the claimant’s appeal and decided that there were housing costs in the form of rent relating to a long tenancy, defined as “a tenancy granted for a term of years certain exceeding 21 years” (Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996, Schedule 2, paragraph 16(1)(a), and regulation 1(3)). The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal, arguing that the arrangement as a whole did not have the characteristic of a long tenancy, but of the acquisition of freehold ownership and that the payments made by the claimant were not rent but mesne profits as in paragraphs 6 and 7 of CIS/14483/1996, and also referring to paragraph 25 of R(H) 3/07, where it was suggested that a lease for more than seven years of registered or unregistered land, even if made by deed, could not come within the definition of a long tenancy (and so payments under it would qualify for housing benefit). It had not been established in the present case what interest, if any, had been registered, but it eventually transpired that the leasehold interest had been entered on the Land Registry property register on 29 June 2009. Section 27(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002 provides that if a disposition of a registered estate or registered charge is required to be completed by registration, it does not operate at law until the relevant registration requirements are met and section (2)(b)(i) includes in the category of dispositions of a registered estate required to be completed by registration “the grant of a term of years absolute for a term of more than seven years from the date of the grant”.
Held, allowing the appeal and re-making the decision on the appeal before the appeal tribunal, that:
1.	a tenancy that has not been registered as required cannot meet the definition for the purpose of paragraph 16(1)(a) as a “tenancy granted” since the terms of the Land Registration Act 2002 are completely unqualified in providing that a tenancy for more than seven years does not operate at law until the relevant registration requirements are met but will, at most, take effect in equity only: observations in R(H) 3/07 approved (paragraphs 18 to 22);
2.	registration has effect only from the date of the application in pursuance of which the entry in the register was made (Land Registration Act 2002, section 74(b)) and so the effect does not relate back to the date of the disposition itself and for both housing costs and housing benefit a payment made at any date can only relate to a long tenancy if one exists at that date (paragraph 23); 
3.	for the period before registration took effect the tenancy agreement could not have effect as a grant of a long tenancy even if it had been validly executed, but, following the entry in the register, the claimant was deemed by virtue of section 58 of the Land Registration Act 2002 to have the legal leasehold estate, regardless of whether the tenancy agreement was properly executed as a deed or not (paragraph 25);
4.	it was quite impossible to say that the entry on the register on 29 June 2009 was made in pursuance of any application earlier than that received on that date and so a long tenancy as defined in the legislation did not exist until 29 June 2009 and the appeal tribunal erred in law in concluding that as at 15 March 2007 the claimant was paying rent relating to a long tenancy (paragraphs 24 and 33);
5.	at all times from whenever housing costs could otherwise have become part of his applicable amount down to 15 March 2007 the claimant was not making payments relating to a long tenancy or any other payments that qualified as housing costs for the purposes of jobseeker’s allowance and the existing decision under which his jobseeker’s allowance was calculated therefore did not fall to be superseded (paragraphs 33 and 34).

Tribunal procedure – fair hearing – Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights – whether hearing in mental health case should be held in public at request of applicant
The applicant was detained at a high security hospital pursuant to sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. He had a mental disorder classified since September 2008 as a psychopathic disorder. Prior to that date his mental disorder had been classified as mental illness and psychopathic disorder. He had been continuously detained under the Act for over 23 years. He applied to the First-tier Tribunal (mental health) for discharge and for his appeal to be heard in public, so that the public could be aware of what he saw as failings in the system, especially in relation to his diagnosis. Rule 38(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008 provides that hearings must be held in private unless the tribunal considers that it is in the interests of justice for the hearing to be held in public. The tribunal heard evidence from two medical experts, one of whom expressed concern at the possibly adverse effect of negative publicity in the longer term, while the other thought that those considerations were on balance outweighed by the negative impact of refusing a public hearing. The tribunal found that a public hearing would be unlikely to attract much if any media interest, but thought “adverse or no publicity” would be a serious disappointment, and hinder the patient’s progress in the longer term. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal. It was common ground that the Upper Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the decision to refuse a public hearing. 
Held, in an interim decision, that:
1.	any exception to the open justice principle in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights must be clearly justified and, although in the generality of cases the protection of the interests of mental health patients will justify an exception to that principle, the main consideration is the protection of the interests of the patient (paragraphs 16 to 28);
2.	the tribunal had started from the wrong point in relying on what it described as “relevant principles”, which were not so much principles as reasons given by eminent judges to justify the general principle of open justice, instead of directing attention to Article 6 and its exceptions. It is a fundamental principle, both in common law and in Article 6, that open justice is a right, which does not require justification on a case by case basis and that it is the exceptions which need to be justified (paragraphs 41 to 43);
3.	the factors to be considered in any application for a public hearing are: (a) whether it is consistent with the subjective and informed wishes of the patient (assuming that he is competent to make an informed choice); (b) whether it will have an adverse effect on his mental health in the short or long term, taking account of the views of those treating him and any other expert views; (c) whether there are any other special factors for or against a public hearing; (d) whether practical arrangements can be made for an open hearing without disproportionate burden on the hospital or relevant authority (paragraphs 29 and 44);
4.	applying those factors to the present case: (a) was clearly satisfied as the applicant had waived his right to privacy and there was no dispute that he was able to make an informed choice; although the arguments under head (b) were finely balanced, and reflected a degree of speculation, the views of the patient himself, supported by his own expert, should carry considerable weight in the absence of other countervailing factors, and factor (c) was satisfied because the case was out of the ordinary and for that reason merited special consideration, in that the patient had been kept in detention at public expense over 23 years, often in conditions of high security, and there had recently been a change in his diagnosis, which potentially gave the case some heightened public significance (paragraph 45 to 48).

The Three-judge Panel set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and directed a further hearing by the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence as to practicalities and costs, previous practice, and practices elsewhere in the United Kingdom, in Europe and in other common law counties.
Held, in a final decision following a further hearing, that:
5.	once the tests in (2) above for establishing a right to a public hearing have been satisfied, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (reinforced by article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) requires that a patient should have the same or substantially equivalent right of access to a public hearing as a non-disabled person who has been deprived of his or her liberty and such a right can only be denied a patient if enabling that right imposes a truly disproportionate burden on the State (paragraph 22);
6.	how the right to a public hearing can practically and proportionately be achieved will depend on the facts of each individual case, including the facilities available in the hospital in question (paragraph 23).
The Panel directed that the First-tier Tribunal hold a public hearing of the applicant’s appeal at which the applicant and his representatives were to be enabled to attend in person in the same hearing room as the hearing took place.

Income support – housing costs – whether loan “taken out” to acquire an interest in the home – whether “incurred” during relevant period
The claimant and her husband resided in a property owned by the husband. He had purchased the property in 1987 and it became subject to a mortgage taken out by him in 2002. The claimant and her husband divorced in 2007. In terms of a court order, the property was transferred to the claimant. The building society refused to transfer the loan to the claimant but, in terms of the order, she undertook to relieve her husband of the obligation to make mortgage repayments. The claimant had been in receipt of income support since 2003 and sought to include the mortgage interest payments as eligible housing costs. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the claimant was legally responsible for the mortgage interest payments and that these payments were eligible housing costs in terms of paragraph 15 of Schedule 3 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (the Regulations). The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal upheld the decision albeit on a different basis holding that, for the purposes of paragraph 2(1)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Regulations, the claimant was a person meeting the housing costs because her ex-husband was not meeting them and it was reasonable to meet those costs for her to continue to live in the home. The Secretary of State appealed with permission of the judge of the Upper Tribunal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	Schedule 3 to the Regulations, in so far as relevant to this appeal, set out a number of requirements. The first requirement under paragraph 2 of the Schedule was that the claimant must be liable to meet the mortgage interest payments. There was no dispute that the claimant in this case was so liable (paragraph 15);
2.	the second requirement was that the loan was a qualifying loan for the purposes of paragraphs 15 to 17 of Schedule 3. In essence, two questions must be answered: (i) whether the loan was taken out to acquire an interest in the home or to pay off another loan that was taken out for that purpose; and (ii) whether the loan was incurred before 2003 (paragraphs 16 to 19);
3.	although the claimant had assumed responsibility for the payments, legal liability for the loan remained with her husband. The claimant had not taken out a new loan nor had she taken over an existing loan. If the claimant defaulted, her liability was to her husband and not to the building society. In the circumstances of this case, it was apparent that the loan taken out by the husband in 2002 had not been taken out to acquire an interest in the property (paragraph 30);
4.	it could not be considered that, where there was one loan, it could be said to be “taken out” at a different time from when it was “incurred” for the purposes of paragraphs 15(1) and 4(2) of Schedule 3 to the Regulations. Although the draftsman had used different language in these paragraphs, the obvious interpretation was that a loan is taken out/incurred at the same time. It therefore followed that, even if the claimant had successfully established that she had taken out the loan at the time of the ancillary relief proceedings thereby satisfying the provisions of paragraph 15(1), she would necessarily have incurred it while she was on income support and thus would have been disqualified from receiving benefit by reason of paragraph 4(1) (paragraph 31).

Tribunal procedure – criteria for suspension of effect of tribunal decision 
The parents of a boy diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder appealed to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales. The parties were agreed that the current placement was not suitable. The tribunal accepted the parents’ argument that the child needed a waking day curriculum and a residential placement. The authority applied to the tribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 6 August 2010. As the tribunal has no power to suspend the effect of its own decision, the authority applied to the Upper Tribunal for a suspension under rule 5(3)(m) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, which gives the Upper Tribunal power to suspend the effect of a decision, but only in an appeal or an application to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal. In the meantime, the authority offered several temporary options to the parents, which would provide additional support. On 20 August 2010 an Upper Tribunal judge waived the requirement in rule 21(2)(b) that would have prevented an application to the Upper Tribunal unless the tribunal had refused or not admitted an application and accordingly treated the application for suspension as an application for permission to appeal. On 2 September 2010, the judge gave the authority permission to appeal and suspended the effect of the tribunal’s decision. On 3 September 2010, the parents applied for the suspension to be set aside, arguing that none of the temporary options offered by the authority was acceptable.
Held, refusing to set aside the direction, that:
1.	applying Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs v Downs [2009] EWCA Civ 257, the questions to be decided were: have solid grounds been put forward by the authority for the effect of the tribunal’s decision to be suspended, and if so, on balance should the effect of the decision be suspended (paragraph 17);
2.	the strength of the authority’s appeal cannot be a threshold criterion as the power to suspend may have to be exercised before the grounds of appeal are known, but it can be taken into account as the background or context of the balancing exercise that must be undertaken or in the exercise of the tribunal’s discretion (paragraphs 20 and 21);
3.	insofar as there was a need to find solid ground as a threshold criterion in this case, it existed in the need to act at all times in the best interests of the child (paragraph 26);
4.	the public interest is always a relevant factor in the balancing exercise to the extent that suspension is not automatic and while in some cases there may be additional public interest considerations, it did not have any additional significance in this case where the focus must be on the child and his education (paragraphs 27 and 28);
5.	delay may be a relevant factor and is certainly relevant if it has any effect on the interests of the child. However in this case there had not been undue delay by the authority and, despite the undoubted impact that the uncertainty had produced for the child, the delay was a relative minor factor in the overall balancing exercise (paragraphs 29 to 31);
6.	the issue in this case was how to keep the disruption caused by the inevitable change to a minimum and it was better for the child to avoid the considerable disruption in all the matters involved in a residential placement unless that was necessary and, since there could be no ideal solution until the child’s ultimate placement was known and the options offered by the local authority provided appropriate short-term provision to protect his interests, on balance it was in his interests for the suspension to remain (paragraphs 35 to 43).
The judge gave directions for concluding the case as quickly as possible.

Income – payments to residential college for accommodation costs – whether to be treated as notional income or disregarded because college was a “care home”
The claimant, who had learning difficulties, was attending a residential college. The cost of the residential accommodation was partially funded by the local authority. He claimed income support and a decision-maker refused his claim on the basis that his total income exceeded his applicable amount, treating part of the local authority’s payments towards his college fees as his notional income in respect of meals under regulation 42(4)(a)(ii) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (payments to third parties). On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the claimant’s representative argued that the college was a “care home”, so that regulation 42(4A) applied instead of regulation 42(4)(a)(ii), with the result that any notional income had to be disregarded in full under paragraph 66 of Schedule 9 to the same Regulations. The tribunal decided that on balance the college was first and foremost an educational establishment and therefore should not be treated as a care home. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. According to regulation 2(1) of the 1987 Regulations “care home’ in England and Wales has the meaning assigned to it by section 3 of the Care Standards Act 2000, which at the relevant time provided that an establishment is a care home if it provides accommodation, together with nursing or personal care, for, inter alia, persons who are disabled or infirm.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	there is no suggestion in either the Care Standards Act 2000 or the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 that a care home ceases to be a care home by virtue of fulfilling some other function, unless there is an express statutory exception in the primary or secondary legislation, and so the tribunal had erred in law in concluding that the college should not be treated as a care home because it was first and foremost an educational establishment (paragraph 20);
2.	there can be no doubt that the college was a care home within section 3 of the 2000 Act because it provided accommodation, together with nursing or personal care for “persons who are disabled or infirm” within section 3(1) and 3(2)(c) and was not excluded by any of the specific exemptions listed in section 3(3)(a)–(c) (paragraph 21);
3.	nor did the college fall within the exception for institutions within the further education sector in regulation 3 of the Care Home Regulations 2001 as it stood at the relevant time, because, even if it met the definition of a further education institution, it fell to be excluded from that regulation by paragraph (3) because of its level of provision of nursing and personal care (paragraphs 22 and 23);
4.	the funding provided by the county council to cover the claimant’s fees, in so far as it included sums for the cost of meals, counted as his notional income within regulation 42(4A) of the 1987 Regulations, and not regulation 42(4)(a)(ii), and so was fully disregarded by paragraph 66 of Schedule 9 and the claimant was therefore entitled to income support (paragraph 30).

Child support – maintenance assessment – housing costs – interest on mortgage to buy out ex-partner’s share in home
The parties were the parents of two qualifying children who lived with the parent with care, their mother. The non-resident parent, their father, was liable to pay child support maintenance in respect of the children. The mother appealed against the assessment, challenging the amount of the father’s eligible housing costs to be included in the calculation. The father had increased the mortgage on his home by borrowing £40,699 to buy out his ex-partner’s share in the property which was thereafter transferred into his sole name. The First-tier Tribunal found that the extra borrowing was necessarily incurred to enable the father to buy out his ex-partner’s share in the home he occupied. The mother appealed to the Upper Tribunal, querying whether the increase was eligible under paragraph 4(1)(a) of Schedule 3 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 as being necessarily incurred for the purpose of purchasing, renting or otherwise securing possession of the home, citing CCS/1418/2003 where money raised on mortgage to satisfy a court order on divorce was held not to be an eligible housing cost in the absence of evidence that the decision to raise it in that way was other than a matter of choice. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission submitted, citing R(CS) 12/98, that if the father could continue to secure occupation of his home only by purchasing the interest of his ex-partner in that home, then such borrowing would fall within the scope of paragraph 4(1)(a), and would fall to be included as an eligible housing cost.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	in the present case (unlike the situation in CCS/1418/2003) evidence should be available as to the nature of the arrangement between the father and his ex-partner and the degree of compulsion, or otherwise, upon the father to make satisfactory payment to his ex-partner to secure possession of his home. As it was unlikely that there would be many cases involving this point where at least some evidence could not be made available, the approach in R(CS) 12/98 was to be preferred to that in CCS/1418/2003 (paragraph 15);
2.	as stated in CCS/1418/2003, paragraph 4(1)(a) requires that the possession should be in doubt or at risk before the expenditure is incurred. The tribunal did not go far enough with its enquiries and thus failed to make adequate findings of fact as to whether the father borrowed the additional sum for the purpose of securing possession of the home (paragraph 16).	

The judge remitted the appeal for reconsideration by a differently constituted tribunal.

Special educational needs – special educational provision – naming school – unreasonable public expenditure – calculation of cost at maintained school
The appellant was the grandmother of a child with special needs. She appealed against the naming of a maintained school in his statement, contending that a specific independent school would better meet his needs. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that either school would meet his needs. Applying section 9 of the Education Act 1996 as amended, it held that it would not be compatible with the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure to place the child at the independent school in accordance with his grandmother’s wishes. It found that that the annual cost to the local authority of a placement at the independent school would be £14,625 (exclusive of any travel costs) and the annual cost of a placement at the independent school would be £2,899 (the Age Weighted Pupil Unit (AWPU)) plus transport costs of £3,315 per year, having rejected the appellant’s submission that there would be further costs by reason of additional staff being required to meet the child's needs. On appeal to the Upper Tribunal it was contended that the First-tier Tribunal had adopted an erroneous approach to the question of public expenditure. Having considered a number of authorities, including Oxfordshire County Council v GB and Others [2001] EWCA Civ 1358; [2002] ELR 8, Coventry City Council v Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal and Another [2007] EWHC 2278 (Admin); [2008] ELR 1 and Slough Borough Council v Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal and Others [2010] EWCA Civ 668; [2010] ELR 687, the Upper Tribunal rejected that contention, holding that there was no real inconsistency between Oxfordshire and Slough, and dismissed the appeal. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the Upper Tribunal had erred in law in its approach to the decisions in Slough and Oxfordshire including in particular, in holding that the First-tier Tribunal did not need to consider the real, full or notional per capita cost to the school of a placement and was concerned only with the marginal cost to the local authority. It was argued that the only proper measure of additional public expenditure was the expenditure of the school, by reference to an analysis of its accounts.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there can be “public expenditure” for the purposes of section 9 at either or both stages of the process: when the local authority allocates public funds to the school, and when the school spends those public funds (paragraph 25);
2.	Coventry and Slough were rejecting extreme submissions to the effect that the delegated arrangements between the local authority and the schools meant that there was no additional cost to the local authority, and neither case was authority for the broad proposition that the First-tier Tribunal must always focus on the school’s accounts to the exclusion of the local authority’s budgetary arrangements ((paragraph 26);
3.	 in accordance with the judgment in Oxfordshire the exercise to be carried out by the First-tier Tribunal  when calculating the cost to public funds of sending a child to a maintained school was to determine what additional burden would be placed on the local authority's budget (paragraph 28);
4.	Oxfordshire and Slough are consistent in that they both demonstrate that the question whether placing a child at a particular school would cause “unreasonable public expenditure” should be approached by the First-tier Tribunal in a common sense manner on the basis of whatever evidence it considers most helpful in resolving this issue in any particular case (paragraph 29, 32);
5.	the local authority’s budgetary arrangements for an individual school will usually be a sensible starting point and if those arrangements make provision for the payment of an AWPU to the school there is no reason why the First-tier Tribunal should not accept that the AWPU, together with any additional costs specifically incurred in respect of the child in question, are a fair reflection of the cost to the public purse of educating the child at that school. Examples of such costs were transport costs or the costs of therapy or learning support if an additional therapist or learning support assistant had to be employed by the school, or if an existing therapist or assistant had to be paid to work additional hours (paragraph 30);
6.	it should only be in those cases where there is no AWPU payment by the local authority or where the First-tier Tribunal is satisfied that, for some cogent reason, the AWPU plus any additional costs do not fairly reflect the cost to the public purse of placing the child in a particular school, that the First-tier Tribunal would consider it necessary to adopt some other method of calculating the public expenditure involved in that placement for the purposes of section 9 (paragraph 31).

Tribunal practice – majority decision – decision notice and statement of reasons – whether tribunal obliged to record that decision not unanimous 
The record of proceedings showed that the First-tier Tribunal had allowed the claimant’s appeal by a majority, as permitted by Article 8 of the First-Tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Composition of Tribunal) Order 2008. However, the decision notice indicated that the decision was unanimous as the pre-printed word “unanimous” was not struck out. The statement of reasons said nothing about whether the decision had been unanimous or by a majority. There was no requirement in the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 for a tribunal to record in a decision notice or statement of reasons that one of the members dissented or the reasons given by the dissenting member for dissenting, as had been required by the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 before 3 November 2008. On appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the Secretary of State submitted that a statement of reasons is inadequate if it fails to record that information. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	a tribunal within the Social Entitlement Chamber was not obliged to state in the notice of its decision that it had been made by a majority, the change in the terms of the legislation from those in operation for social security and child support cases before 3 November 2008 being compelling, and it was legitimate and not inconsistent with any fundamental principles of natural justice or a fair trial for the judgment to be made that the interests of having a final conclusion on the issues in dispute outweighed the arguments for disclosure of more information. However, that did not prevent a particular tribunal or a Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal or some constituent part of such a Chamber deciding that such information would be given (paragraph 8);
2.	if a tribunal has not stated in its decision notice whether the decision is unanimous or by a majority, it cannot be under an obligation when giving a statement of reasons to give that information and to state the reasoning of the minority, as that would undermine the conclusion in the previous holding (paragraph 9);
3.	however, if a decision notice accurately records that the decision was by a majority and a statement of reasons is prepared, at least a brief statement of the reasons for the dissent of the minority member should be given there, as it is implicit in the basic principle of enabling the losing party to understand why he or she has lost that there should be some statement of in what respects the minority member would have decided in his or her favour (paragraph 10);
4.	an inaccurate statement in a decision notice that the decision was unanimous can be cured or rendered non-material if the subsequent statement of reasons acknowledges the mistake, correctly sets out that the decision was by a majority and gives an adequate statement of the reasons of the minority member, but the statement of reasons in this case did nothing to acknowledge or correct the inaccuracy of the decision notice, and accordingly, the decision involved an error of law (paragraph 11).
The judge remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal for a complete rehearing.

Criminal injuries compensation – reduction and withholding of awards – meaning of “failed to co-operate with the police ... in attempting to bring the assailant to justice”
The claimant reported an assault to the police, but when interviewed stated that she did not wish at that time to make an official complaint against her alleged assailants. The police investigated the incident further but no prosecution was made.  Her claim for compensation was rejected on the ground that she had failed to co-operate with the police in attempting to bring the assailant to justice (paragraph 13(b) of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2001) and the decision was confirmed on review. She appealed and she and the police officer attended the hearing and gave evidence. The tribunal found that the claimant had been presented with options as to action that could be taken by the police, but dismissed the appeal, stating as its reasons that the police investigation and prosecution were discontinued as a result of her unwillingness to give evidence against her alleged assailants. The claimant applied to the Upper Tribunal for the decision of the tribunal to be quashed, arguing that a person can fail to co-operate with another person only if he or she refuses to comply with a request from that person to work to a particular end, or to take some preferred course of action.
Held, quashing the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, that:
1.	the obligation which underlies paragraph 13(b) is an obligation to co-operate with the police to the extent and in the manner reasonably to be expected of a person making a claim for an ex gratia compensatory payment at public expense, and is not limited to a refusal to comply with a specific request made by the investigating authorities (paragraphs 10 and11);
2.	what paragraph 13(b) requires is that the claimant should co-operate with the normal processes for investigating crime and dealing with offenders, irrespective of what course of action is ultimately chosen by the authorities as appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case (paragraph 12);
3.	having made a finding that the police officer had presented various options to the claimant, the tribunal was under an obligation to explain why it rejected the claimant’s case that, in choosing one of the options, she had done what was required of her to co-operate with the police in attempting to bring her assailants to justice: Re M (a child) [2005] CLY 67 followed (paragraphs 13 and 14);
4.	on the evidence the tribunal was not bound to conclude that the claimant would play no further part in attempting to bring her assailants to justice nor that the police investigation and prosecution were discontinued as a result of the claimant’s unwillingness to make an official complaint (paragraphs 15 and 16);
5.	as the tribunal’s reasons did not properly address the central issue raised by the claimant in her appeal and its findings of fact were not supported by the evidence the decision should be quashed as irrational (paragraph 17).
	
The judge remitted the appeal for reconsideration by the First-tier Tribunal.

Tribunal jurisdiction – disability discrimination – meaning of “admissions” decision  
The pupil sat the test for admission to a grammar school within the Council’s area, having indicated preferences as to grammar and non-grammar schools. Because he was dyslexic he was allowed an extra ten minutes by a review panel to sit the paper. He was unsuccessful in the test and his mother appealed to the Independent Appeals Panel (IAP) operated by the Council. Following a hearing the IAP rejected the appeal. They accepted that the pupil was disabled for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but considered that reasonable adjustments had been made for him by providing the extra ten minutes. The mother made a claim to SENDIST (the statutory predecessor to the First-tier Tribunal) contending that the Council had failed to make reasonable adjustments for the child when he took the test. The Council applied for the claim to be struck out on the ground that section 28I of the Act, which would otherwise confer jurisdiction on the tribunal, did not do so because section 28K applied as the claim related to an admissions decision and appeal arrangements had been made under section 94 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. That application was refused. When the tribunal heard the case, it declined to revisit the question of jurisdiction, taking the view that it had already been decided in favour of the claimant when the strike-out application was refused. However, it concluded that the child was not a disabled person for the purposes of the 1995 Act. The claimant sought to appeal that decision. The First-tier Tribunal judge gave her permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Before the Upper Tribunal the Council argued that the First-tier Tribunal had been wrong to decline to revisit the issue of jurisdiction and that the First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim. An “admission decision” for the purposes of section 28K is defined in section 94 of the 1998 Act as “any decision made by or on behalf of the authority as to the school at which education is to be provided for the child in the exercise of the authority’s functions”.
Held, setting aside the tribunal’s decision on the Council’s grounds, that:
1.	since the  power to strike out is to be exercised only in plain and obvious cases, the fact that a given point has failed at that stage does not mean that the same point could not succeed at full hearing, and so the tribunal had erred by treating the refusal to strike out as final (paragraph 14);
2.	the language of section 94(1)(a) is relatively widely drawn, suggesting that there may be a variety of decisions caught by the subsection and more than one, if need be, in relation to any pupil, and leaving open the possibility that a decision other than the naming of the school which the child is to attend may fall within the ambit of the subsection (paragraph 26);
3.	in the present case the effect of the test was to exclude the pupil concerned (subject to any appeal) from attending the grammar school of preference or indeed any grammar school within the Council’s area, and that negative effect was within the wording of section 94(1)(a) as interpreted above (paragraph 26); 
4.	such a view was consistent with an effective appeal process in such cases, in that it provided for a statutory right of appeal at the stage when what would principally be the live issue, whether a child is eligible for grammar school, could still be addressed, whereas to consider that issue only in the context of an appeal against the naming of a particular non-grammar school later in the process might be too late to be effective, if allocations have by then been made to the various grammar schools (paragraph 26);
5.	the Education (Admissions Appeals Arrangements) Regulations 2002 provide that matters to be taken into account by an IAP should include any preference expressed by the appellant and the school’s admission arrangements, but those matters were not irrelevant to an appeal against test outcome since by addressing concerns about the test, the panel is taking account of the expressed preference and it was the admission arrangements for the school which would expressly provide for selection by ability or aptitude (paragraph 31);
6.	there was nothing in either the School Admission Code or the School Admission Appeals Code to indicate that section 94 should be read otherwise than as above or that the scope of the IAP was limited by the operation of a local non-statutory review procedure (paragraphs 32 to 36);
7.	there was no complaint that the constitution of the IAP in the present case or any aspects of its operation were not in accordance with the 2002 Regulations and there was no other obstacle to the Council’s contention that what was involved was a section 94 appeal and that there were arrangements in place under that section for that appeal (paragraph 36); 
8.	It was the IAP and not SENDIST or its successor, the First-tier Tribunal, which had jurisdiction in the present case. The decision of the IAP had not been challenged and accordingly stood (paragraph 37).

Criminal injuries compensation – awards for mental injury – differences between 1996 scheme and 2001 scheme – meaning of “change in medical condition” in test for re-opening a case
The applicant made a claim under the 1996 Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme for an incident in October 2000 in which his left hand was slashed. Compensation was initially refused, but the case was re-opened following a medical report in December 2002, which described the injuries resulting from the incident as laceration to left hand (not resolved) and anxiety (not resolved). The report described the symptoms of anxiety and depression as being static and not changed since the incident and gave the psychological prognosis that on the balance of probabilities the applicant would be fully recovered in nine months from the date of the report. An award was made in November 2005 for minor scarring to upper limbs, and an application for review of that decision was refused in August 2007. The explanation for refusal stated that all awards under the Scheme included compensation for the degree of shock normally suffered by a person injured in an assault, and that a specific award for the psychological effects of an incident would be made only if that would be equal to or higher than the award for the physical injuries or if there were no qualifying physical injuries. That was not a provision of the 1996 Scheme, but was stated in paragraph 4.9 of the Guide to the Scheme and was a provision of the 2001 Scheme. The explanation also stated that the higher levels of compensation for mental injury in the tariff were payable only if a psychiatrist (or other suitably qualified person) diagnosed a disabling mental disorder. Paragraph 56 of both the 1996 and 2001 Schemes provided that a claims officer might re-open a case where there had been such a material change in the victim’s medical condition that injustice would occur if the original assessment of compensation were allowed to stand, or where he had since died in consequence of the injury. In 2008 the applicant requested a re-opening of his case on the basis of new evidence from a chartered psychologist, giving a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and a prognosis that he would continue to suffer for the foreseeable future. In September 2008 an appeal panel decided, without an oral hearing, that there had not been the necessary material change in the applicant’s medical condition for the case to be re-opened because a report from a chartered psychologist was not sufficient for the purposes of the Scheme to establish disabling mental illness confirmed by psychiatric diagnosis and there was nothing in the report to indicate that the psychologist’s qualifications fell within those which were acceptable to support a claim for disabling mental illness. The applicant applied for judicial review of that decision.
Held, allowing the application and quashing the decision, that:
1.	the requirements of a fair hearing demanded that the applicant be given the opportunity to produce evidence that the psychologist was a clinical psychologist, but if the only possible outcome would have been the conclusion that she was not a clinical psychologist, then if there was no other flaw in the panel’s decision, that would have been a powerful argument for exercising the discretion not to make a quashing order despite the existence of that error of law (paragraphs 16);
2.	however, the claim was under the 1996 Scheme and it would not be proper to read back into the 1996 Scheme the specific restriction to psychiatrists or clinical psychologists introduced in the 2001 Scheme. That meant that the question of whether the psychologist was a suitably qualified person would have to be answered by reference to her substantive qualifications and experience, and in so far as the panel relied on her not having been shown to be a clinical psychologist, rather than not having been shown to be a suitably qualified person to make a psychiatric diagnosis, it went wrong in law (paragraphs 17 and 18);
3.	following R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Williams, 27 June 2000, what is required for paragraph 56 of the 1996 Scheme and succeeding schemes is a change in the applicant’s medical condition that has happened after the date of whatever decision authorises the award of compensation accepted by the applicant (“the original decision”), which in the present case was 7 August 2007, and a pure comparison of the applicant’s actual medical condition as it is now known to have been at that with the current condition (paragraph 27);
4.	a person’s medical condition at any particular time includes the prognosis for the future that could reasonably be made, and if the prognosis accepted at the time of the original turns out to be wrong, because of a mis-diagnosis of the underlying condition at that time, that in itself cannot amount to a change of medical condition. But if an applicant continues to be affected for longer than could reasonably have been predicted at the time of the original decision if what is now known to be the correct diagnosis had been made, that may amount to a change in the applicant’s medical condition (paragraphs 28);
5.	in the absence of any equivalent in the 1996 Scheme to Note 5 to the Tariff in the 2001 Scheme, it was strongly arguable that paragraph 4.9 of the Guide could not be implemented as it was inconsistent with the Scheme itself and that was a factor to be considered if the cases were re-opened (paragraphs 28 to 30).
The judge remitted the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for reconsideration of the question whether the case should be re-opened.

Tribunal procedure – enforcement references – penalties
CB had appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against parts of the statement of special educational needs in respect of her son. She wished her son to attend a particular independent school. The headmaster of that school had signed a statement for the tribunal confirming the offer of a place and providing an assurance that it would be held open for a defined period. The tribunal decided to adjourn the appeal hearing and issue a witness summons under rule 16 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008 (the HESC Rules) for the attendance of the headmaster at the next hearing of the appeal. The headmaster indicated to the local authority that he would not attend the hearing or allow a member of staff to attend, “sub-poenaed or not”, and on receipt of the witness summons, replied stating that it was the school’s policy not to attend tribunal hearings. He indicated that he was willing to answer questions in writing and threatened to withdraw the offer of a place if that was not sufficient. A tribunal judge treated the letter as an application to set aside the witness summons but refused the application. One day before the hearing the headmaster withdrew the offer. He made some attempts to obtain information by telephone about challenging the summons but did not make any application and did not attend the hearing. The First-tier Tribunal adjourned the hearing again, and referred his non-attendance to the Upper Tribunal under rule 7 of the HESC Rules. Section 25 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 confers on the Upper Tribunal in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court and in Scotland, the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the Court of Session, in relation to, inter alia, the attendance and examination of witnesses.
Held, imposing a penalty, that:
1.	the issue was whether the headmaster’s non-attendance should be punished as a contempt of court, as would be the issue for the High Court, but it was not necessary to apply the specific procedural provisions that would apply in the High Court, and the impact of those provisions was be confined to that Court. In passing the 2007 Act, Parliament was intending to confer upon the Tribunal Procedure Committee the power to make the necessary provisions to regulate the issuing of witness summonses by the First-tier Tribunal and the conduct of references to the Upper Tribunal (paragraph 22);
2.	the present case differed from MD v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2010] UKUT 202 (AAC); [2011] AACR 5 in that the summons was properly addressed, gave details of the hearing, gave the requisite notice, indicated the right to apply to have the summons set aside or varied and stated the consequences of failure to comply, all as required by rule 16 of the HESC Rules (paragraph 23);
3.	the Tribunals Service scheme of allowances for witnesses was sufficiently compliant with rule 16(2)(b) and MD should not be understood as suggesting that a doctor is entitled to be recompensed for that financial loss. Rather, the potential for financial detriment to a doctor (and possibly others) in attending is a relevant factor to the tribunal’s decision whether to issue a witness summons in the first place (paragraph 24);
4.	a witness summons issued by the First-tier Tribunal is to be complied with, unless and until it has been set aside or varied by the First-tier Tribunal under rule 16(4) or set aside by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review. The person on whom a witness summons is served is not a party and does not have any right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal under section 11(2), but may apply for permission for judicial review, which can be considered by the Upper Tribunal urgently where necessary (paragraphs 26 to 28).
5.	tribunals should always consider alternatives to personal attendance available to them under relevant Tribunal Procedure Rules but there will be cases where requiring the attendance of a witness is appropriate. As with other case management decisions, provided that relevant factors (examples of which are given) have been considered, the Upper Tribunal will be reluctant to set aside a witness summons in the exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction (paragraph 29);
6.	the headmaster could not rely on his own act in purportedly withdrawing the offer of a place to defeat the materiality of his evidence and it is for the tribunal, not the person summoned, to determine whether attendance is necessary (paragraph 30).
The judges ordered the headmaster to pay a fine of £500.

Capital held in a joint savings account – proper approach in Scots Law to determining whether funds in the account belonged to the claimant and his wife or whether that presumption was rebutted by other evidence 
The claimant and his wife made a joint claim for income-based jobseekers’ allowance. They held certain funds in a joint savings account. Their capital was calculated on the basis that they jointly owned all the money in the account. It was contended by the claimant that some of the money was being held in the account on behalf of the wife’s mother. Before the First-tier Tribunal it was argued that certain funds in the account were held in trust for the mother. The tribunal rejected that assertion and held that there was no documentary or other evidence, and no circumstances present, which supported the existence of a trust. The tribunal also held that legal and beneficial ownership of the funds belonged to the claimant and his wife. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the First-tier Tribunal had misdirected itself in law by considering whether a trust had been established. (paragraph 8(a));
2.	the correct approach in Scots Law was the common law rule in Trotter v Spence (1885) 22 SLR 353 that the rebuttable presumption where funds are held in joint names is joint ownership. There was no need to establish which of them held the funds because, by virtue of regulation 88 of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996, the capital was aggregated (paragraph 8(b));
3.	that rule also applies where it is asserted that the funds in an account actually belong to someone else. In such circumstances, the presumption can be rebutted: Cairn v Davidson 1913 SC 1054. Cairn v Davidson was also authority for the proposition that rebuttal evidence could be given by way of any admissible evidence including oral evidence. The true ownership of funds in a bank account in this case did not require proof of the establishment of a trust but simply evidence in rebuttal of the presumption arising from the joint names of the account (paragraphs 8(b), (c) and (d)).	

The Upper Tribunal Judge remitted the case to the First-tier Tribunal (Social Entitlement Chamber) for redetermination by a differently constituted tribunal in accordance with his directions.

Mental health – deferred conditional discharge with condition of residence in a care home – whether conditional discharge lawful if conditions amount to detention
Upper Tribunal – judicial precedent – whether Upper Tribunal bound by decisions of the High Court exercising its supervisory role
The First-tier Tribunal directed that a “restricted patient” be conditionally discharged with conditions that he live in a care home and not leave it without an escort. The Secretary of State for Justice appealed on the ground that the conditions amounted to detention and he relied on R (Secretary of State for the Home Department) v Mental Health Review Tribunal [2002] EWCA Civ 1868; [2003] MHLR 202 and three High Court decisions that had followed it in support of the principle that the First-tier Tribunal could not discharge a person from one form of detention to another (the PH principle). The patient argued that that principle applied only if the detention was in a hospital and that, in any event, the conditions did not amount to detention. The Upper Tribunal held that it was not bound by the decisions relied on by the Secretary of State to hold that it was irrelevant whether a person was in a hospital, because the Court of Appeal did not decide that issue and High Court decisions in judicial review cases are not binding on the Upper Tribunal where the Upper Tribunal’s appellate role is the successor of the High Court’s supervisory role. The validity of the discharge did not depend just on whether the conditions amounted to detention, which they did, but also on whether the accommodation would be a hospital and, since the accommodation in this case was not a hospital, the discharge was lawful. The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that section 73 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) confers no power to make an order of this kind. When considering an application for discharge, the tribunal must consider whether the detention criteria are still satisfied and if they are not, the patient must be absolutely discharged. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the Strasbourg court has made it clear that such an important matter as deprivation of liberty must be “prescribed by law” (Winterwerp v The Netherlands (1979-1980) 2 EHRR 387) and, although the original order made against RB authorised only detention in a hospital (section 37 and section 41(3)(a)), section 73(2) concerning conditional discharge is wholly silent about deprivation of liberty (paragraphs 48, 53 to 57, 69, 70);
2.	it is clear that Parliament intended that the MHA should comply with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights but Parliament gave the Secretary of State power to consent to a transfer of a patient to other accommodation (MHA section 41(3)(c) read with section 19(3)), indicating that it envisaged such a situation arising and intended the matter to be dealt with by the Secretary of State (subject to the court’s supervisory jurisdiction) and not by the tribunal, and an interpretation of section 73(2) which permits (a) detention in an institution which is not a hospital, (b) detention other than for the purposes of treatment and (c) detention without appropriate medical treatment being available for the patient would be inconsistent with the criteria for admission and for a hospital order set out in sections 3 and 37 (paragraphs 49, 58 to 62, 69, 70);
3.	no justification has been shown for the different procedural guarantees given to restricted patients detained in hospitals and those that would be given to conditionally discharged patients detained in other institutions, as would be required by Article 14, taken with Article 5 (paragraphs 50, 63 to 65, 69, 70); 
4.	therefore, a tribunal cannot rely on the patient’s best interest as a ground for ordering conditional discharge on terms that involve a deprivation of liberty, particularly if the detention would not be for the purpose of any treatment (paragraphs 66, 69, 70).

Criminal injuries compensation – assessment of compensation in respect of future loss of earnings – whether loss to be proved on the balance of probabilities
The claimant suffered psychiatric injury following an assault. There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal (F tT) that, if the claimant had cognitive behaviour therapy, the chance of her being able to return to work full-time would be 60 per cent. The F-tT decided that she should have had such therapy and that, if she had done so, she would, on the balance of probabilities, have been able to return to her former work by a date 15 months after the hearing and so it decided there would be no loss of earnings after that date. It also found, on the balance of probabilities, that she had not lost a chance of promotion that had arisen before the hearing. The claimant claimed judicial review on the ground that the F-tT should have awarded further compensation on the basis that there was a 40 per cent chance that she would not be able to return to work, submitting that that was the approach at common law and that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2001 required that approach to be applied. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority argued that the Scheme did not require the common law approach to be applied because it made express provision for all matters to be determined on the balance of probabilities but that, in any event, the common law did not require compensation to be assessed on the basis claimed by the claimant. The Upper Tribunal dismissed her application for judicial review and the claimant appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, granting permission to appeal but dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 expressly requires that compensation be determined in accordance with the Scheme and not by common law principles, but this does not require the exercise to be conducted in a straitjacket or mean that no help can be gained from authorities dealing with similar issues (paragraph 34);
2.	the Scheme provides that the standard of proof is to be on the balance of probabilities. However paragraph 33 acknowledges that there must come a stage where proof will have to give way to broader assessment (paragraph 35);
3.	applying the balance of probabilities, the F-tT was satisfied that a continuing loss had been shown for the period of up to the date 15 months after the hearing but not thereafter. This was an issue of fact on which the burden of proof lay on the claimant. The findings of the F-tT were open to it on the evidence and raised no issue of law (paragraph 36).

Tribunal procedure – scope of right of appeal to Upper Tribunal against interlocutory decisions – meaning of “decision” in Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007
Inadequate notice of housing benefit decision – effect on time limits for appeal 

The claimant appealed against the application of a non-dependant deduction by the council in the calculation of her housing benefit on a supersession. She maintained that her ex-partner had not been resident at her address at the relevant times. Her appeals were made well outside the 13-month absolute time limit for bringing an appeal but it was contended on her behalf that they were not late because there had been no proper notification of the decisions sought to be appealed, so that the time limits had not started to run. It was contended that the notice did not comply with the requirement in paragraph 9(c) of Schedule 9 to the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 that the decision notice should contain a statement as to “the amount of and the category of non-dependant deductions made under regulation 74, if any”. A legally qualified panel member initially refused to admit the appeals but later admitted them. The Council did not seek to challenge that decision and the appeals proceeded to a hearing on the merits. At that hearing the First-tier Tribunal Judge decided that he was required to reconsider the issue whether the appeals were irredeemably late, because, if they were, the legally qualified panel member had had no power to admit them and the issue went to his jurisdiction to decide the appeals. He held that the housing benefit decisions had been properly notified by means of the letters sent at the time of the decisions, that the time limits for appealing had therefore started to run at the date of notification, and that he therefore had no jurisdiction to consider the appeals on their merits. It was common ground that his decision should be treated as a decision striking out the appeals under rule 8(2)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 (the SEC Rules). The claimant sought to challenge that decision and, taking the view that it was unclear whether the correct avenue of challenge was by way of appeal to the Upper Tribunal or by way of an application for judicial review in the Administrative Court, made applications for permission in both jurisdictions. The judicial review claim was transferred to the Upper Tribunal, which gave permission both to pursue a claim for judicial review and to appeal. In view of the wider importance of the avenue of challenge issue a three-judge panel was constituted. Section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provides a right to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on any point of law arising from a decision made by the First-tier Tribunal other than an excluded decision. It was common ground that the strike-out decision was not an excluded decision, but it was argued that it was not a “decision” for the purposes of section 11 but a determination of a matter along the way leading to a decision, relying on Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Morina [2007] EWCA Civ 749; [2007] 1 WLR 3033 (also reported as R(IS) 6/07).
Held, allowing the appeal in CH/1758/2009 and dismissing the claim for judicial review in JR/2204/2009, that:
1.	the word “decision” in both section 11(1) and section 13(1) (which concerns appeals from decisions of the Upper Tribunal) must be read broadly in accordance with its natural meaning and not given the restricted meaning given to it in Morina in the different context of section 14 of the Social Security Act 1998. It followed that interlocutory decisions were in principle appealable and an appeal lay against the strike-out decision in the present case. It would therefore be inappropriate to grant the claimant any relief by way of judicial review (paragraphs 79 to 97);
2.	while it was possible to construe the notice requirements “on a claim” in paragraph 9(c) of Schedule 9 to the 2006 Regulations as applying also on a supersession, it was not necessary to decide that point, as although the notification letters did not adequately specify the category of non-dependant deduction, that breach did not substantially prejudice the claimant in the present case where that point was not in issue, and therefore did not prevent the time for appeal from running: Haringey LBC v Awaritefe (1999) 32 HLR 517 followed (paragraphs 104 to 123);
3.	at the time when the appeals were made the absolute time limit for appealing under the procedural regulations then applicable had expired and the later coming into force of the SEC Rules did not give the First-tier Tribunal the power to extend the absolute time limit. The appeals were irredeemably out of time and the decision that they should be admitted was therefore wrong (paragraphs 124 to 132);
4.	(per Chamber President and Judge Turnbull) however the decision of the legally qualified panel member to admit the appeals was a decision that she had power to make, even though it went to the appeal tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal. By regulation 18(4) of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 the legally qualified panel member was given power to determine whether the appeals were within time and it was established by Watt v Ahsan [2007] UKHL 51; [2008] AC 696 that an issue estoppel could arise from a decision by a tribunal as to whether it has jurisdiction. The decision striking out the appeals on the ground that the legally qualified panel member had not had that power was therefore wrong in law and fell to be set aside, and it was appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to re-make the strike-out decision (paragraphs 134 to 146);
5.	(per Chamber President and Judge Turnbull) in re-making the strike-out decision it was not necessary to form a concluded view on whether the judge who made that decision had had power to reconsider the decision of the legally qualified panel member to admit the appeals (whether because it was not a “final” decision and so could not give rise to an issue estoppel or by virtue of a general discretion to allow an issue to be reopened in special circumstances). Even if there were such power it would not be appropriate to exercise it in all the circumstances of the case (paragraphs 148 to 164).
6.	(per Judge Rowland, dissenting) the First-tier Tribunal had not held that the legally qualified panel member had no power to decide whether or not to admit the appeals. The key issue on the appeal was whether the decision to admit the appeal was “final” and the First-tier Tribunal had correctly held that it was not final because it was made in a summary fashion without notice and such decisions by tribunals are appropriate only on the basis that they can be revisited at a later date in the event of there being an objection. A decision made in that manner was not the determination of a preliminary point of the type contemplated by the House of Lords in Watt v Ahsan. While an issue estoppel may arise in some circumstances, such as where the conduct of one party has induced another to treat the decision as final to their disadvantage, the inaction by the Council in the present case did not create an issue estoppel. It followed that, given his doubts about it and the fact that the Council wanted it reconsidered, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was right to consider that he was bound to reconsider the decision to admit the appeal (paragraphs 168 to 189).

Carer’s allowance – meaning of “receiving full-time education” – relevance of hours actually spent – application of Deane to the test in the primary legislation
The claimant was enrolled on a three-year BA course, described by the university as full-time. At all material times she was engaged in providing care for her father and was potentially eligible for carer’s allowance. Her claim was refused because she was found to be in full-time education and she appealed. Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 a person receiving full-time education is not entitled to carer’s allowance. Regulation 5(1) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 provides that a person shall be treated as receiving full-time education for any period during which he attends a course of education for 21 hours a week or more, including time spent in the activities specified in paragraph (2). The university stated that the claimant was expected to spend 22 hours in study. The tribunal accepted the claimant’s argument that she was able to spend fewer than 21 hours a week, because of the substantial prior knowledge she had as a result of completing a BTEC course, although she had not been exempted from any modules. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal, arguing that section 70(3) applied wherever a carer was undertaking a course of education which was stated to be a full-time course from the outset, even if they were studying part-time, it having been held in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Deane [2010] EWCA Civ 699; [2010] AACR 42 that regulation 5 was not exhaustive of the circumstances in which a person was to be regarded as being in full-time education for the purposes of entitlement to carer’s allowance. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	as regulation 5 has to be construed consistently with section 70(3), there is a presumption under both provisions that if the course on which a student is enrolled is one offered as a full-time university course, as opposed to a part-time university course, the recipient is in full-time education (paragraph 19);
2.	the Secretary of State’s argument was too widely stated to stand as a proposition of law, as it was clear from Deane that, while there was a presumption that a student enrolled on a course described as full-time was receiving full-time education, it was possible for there to be exceptions, whether by virtue of the student being exempt from part of the course or otherwise (paragraph 26);
3.	in the present case there was insufficient to rebut the presumption that the claimant, being on a course regarded as full-time, was receiving full-time education and thus that she was disentitled from carer’s allowance under section 70(3). There was therefore no need for further consideration of whether the tribunal erred in law in its approach to regulation 5 (paragraphs 26 to 28).

The three appellants, all private tenants, each needed to occupy a property which contained one bedroom more than the number of bedrooms which the housing benefit legislation specified should be taken into account in determining their housing benefit entitlement. Mr Burnip and Ms Trengove were severely disabled and needed a second bedroom for an overnight carer, but their housing benefit was required to be calculated on the basis of the rent appropriate for a one bedroom flat. Mr Gorry’s housing benefit entitlement was required to be calculated on the basis that his two daughters would share a bedroom, but by reason of their disability it was not reasonable for them to do so. The appellants’ appeals against the amount of the housing benefit awards were dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal and then the Upper Tribunal. The appellants relied on unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1 (A1P1). It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that (i) that the cases fell within the ambit of A1P1, in that housing benefit is a “possession” and (ii) that disability is within the concluding words “or other status” of Article 14. 

Held, allowing the appeals, that:

1.	The appellants had established a prima facie case of discrimination within Article 14 on both the alternative bases for which they contended.  First, the legislation had a disparate adverse effect on disabled people. Malcolm v Lewisham LBC [2008] UKHL 43, relied on by the Secretary of State, did not provide the correct approach; it turned on the construction of section 24 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Further, in the particular circumstances the appellants’ case did not need to be based on statistical evidence. Secondly, the legislation failed to treat differently persons whose situations were significantly different, under the principle applied by the Strasbourg Court in Thlimmenos v Greece (2001) 31 EHRR 15. That principle could apply to require a State to take positive steps to allocate a greater share of public resources to a particular person or group; (paragraphs 10 to 18) 

2.	The Secretary of State had not established objective and reasonable justification for the discrimination. First, the wider benefits background, and in particular the other benefits to which the appellants (and in the case of Mr Gorry his family) were entitled, and the other elements involved in calculating the housing benefit entitlement, did not provide justification: it was wrong in principle to regard the appellants’ other subsistence benefits as being notionally available to go towards meeting the shortfall between their housing-related benefits and the rent. Secondly, it was not right to take into account the availability of discretionary housing payments. Thirdly, justification did not exist in a need to have a single set of rules applicable to all: the cost and human resource implications of making exceptions in the appellants’ and similar cases would be modest as such cases were likely to be relatively few in number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse and unlikely to undergo change or need regular monitoring. AM (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ 634 distinguished (paragraph 64). 

3.	The appropriate remedy for the Court of Appeal to grant was declaratory relief, leaving it to the Secretary of State to determine how to rectify the discrimination. Francis v SSWP [2006] 1 WLR 3202 applied (paragraphs 24). 

Note: the Court's Order as drawn up contained, in addition to a declaration, a provision remitting each case to the relevant council for reassessment of the additional sum “necessary to comply with this judgment and Article 14 for the period to which the appeal relates”.

Information rights – whether a public authority may later rely on additional or different exemptions/exclusions from those originally stated
The complainant made a request to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) for information in relation to discussions between the previous Government and the Mayor of London about air quality. Initially the Department relied for its refusal on regulation 12(4)(e) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, and, having been ordered by the Information Commissioner to disclose all the information held, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal relying additionally on regulation 12(5)(b) and (d) and regulation 13. The tribunal refused to allow the Department to rely on these new exceptions as of right and declined to exercise its discretion to allow it to do so. DEFRA appealed, the complainant contending that a public authority may only rely in proceedings before the Information Commissioner and the tribunal upon the exception or exceptions specified in its reasons for refusing the request, and the Information Commissioner adopting a middle course, that while there was no right to rely on new exceptions/exemptions, a public authority could be permitted to do so at the discretion of either the Commissioner or the tribunal. The Upper Tribunal heard the case together with an appeal from the Information Commissioner where the First-tier Tribunal had decided, on the appeal of the Home Office, that the Home Office was entitled as of right to rely on new exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and that, if it had been a matter of discretion, the tribunal would have allowed it to do so. The Upper Tribunal judge upheld the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the Home Office case, agreeing that a public authority had the right under the Freedom of Information Act to rely on new exemptions, subject only to the case management powers of the First-tier Tribunal. In the second case, he agreed with DEFRA. Having noted that the Directive gives effect to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Convention), he considered the relevant provisions of the Directive and the Regulations and two decisions of the CJEU, Case C-233/00 Commission v France [2003] ECR I-6625, and Case C-186/04 Housieaux v Délégués du conseil de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale [2005] ECR I-3299, and concluded that they did not justify, still less require, a conclusion that was different from that which resulted from an analysis of the Freedom of Information Act. The complainant appealed, not contending that there is any provision in either the Regulations, or the enforcement and appeals provisions in the Act which are applied by the Regulations, read purely as domestic statutes, which prohibits reliance upon a new exception, but contending that permitting a public authority to rely upon a new exception before the Commissioner or the tribunal would be contrary to the underlying purpose of Council Directive 2003/4/EC which is implemented by the Regulations.
Held, dismissing the appeal and declining to refer the issue to the Court of Justice of the European Union, that:
1.	the time limits for notifying a refusal and for stating the reasons for refusal (including the exception(s) relied on) are mandatory (Commission v France and Housieaux). However, considering the Directive as a whole, there are three features of the environmental information regime which are interrelated: (1) the relatively short time within which the initial decision to release, or to refuse to release (with reasons) must be made, (2) the broad scope of the review process under Article 6 of Council Directive 2003/4/EC and (3) the balance that has to be struck between the public interest in the prompt release of environmental information and the need to avoid harm to the other important public interests listed in Article 12(2) (paragraphs18 to 21);
2.	the court or other legal body conducting the review under Article 6(2) is not reviewing the decision made by the administrative reviewer under Article 6(1), but reviewing “the acts or omissions of the public body concerned”. Thus, the court must consider de novo the propriety of releasing the information. Such a process is bound to discover errors and omissions in the exceptions relied upon in initial decisions, and it would be surprising, given the balancing exercise required by the Directive, if those errors were incapable of subsequent correction (paragraph 23);
3.	permitting a public authority to rely on a new exception in the administrative and legal review processes under Article 6 does not deprive the person seeking the information of any effective judicial control and does not thereby destroy the effectiveness of the process. At the administrative review stage the Information Commissioner has ample power to regulate the proceedings before him, and at the legal review stage the Tribunal Procedure Rules ensure that any new exception, if it is to be relied upon, is identified at the outset of the appeal, and within a relatively short time. Any application by the public authority to rely upon a new exception made after the time limit for its grounds of appeal/response would be subject to the tribunal’s case management powers (paragraphs 26 to 28).",1,381,,,

Housing benefit – landlord providing counselling and other support services – whether the landlord was a person affected by the decision and so had a right of appeal

Salisbury Independent Living (SIL) was a company which provided private housing to vulnerable tenants together with care, supervision and support. SIL disagreed with the council about the awards of housing benefit paid to its tenants and submitted appeals via its solicitors on some sixty cases (both former and current tenants). The council objected that some tenants had not authorised SIL to act on their behalf. The First-tier Tribunal judge asked for the tenants’ signed authorisations for SIL to do so and struck out ten cases where none was provided and also rejected SIL’s application to be added as a party because there had been no valid appeal in those cases. On appeal, the Upper Tribunal held that SIL had an independent right of appeal under paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 as a “person affected by the decision”, notwithstanding that it did not fall within the scope of regulation 3(1) of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/1002), and that the appeals it had lodged without instructions were to be treated as its own appeals. The council appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the ordinary meaning of the legislation, taking statute and Regulations together, was that the 2000 Act anticipated a definition of “person affected” being given in Regulations, and the 2001 Regulations then provided it in terms which were exhaustive (paragraphs 22 to 33);
2.	the pragmatic concern of there being no forum for resolving a dispute which was in commercial reality one between SIL and the council did not sufficiently plainly call for a strained construction and so it was not possible to read the legislation as the Upper Tribunal had (paragraphs 34 to 37).

Special educational needs – special educational provision – naming school – whether the travel costs to the preferred school not the nearest suitable one represented unreasonable public expenditure

The respondent’s son J was autistic and had moderate learning difficulties. He had started a reception class at B School, a special school for pupils with learning difficulties. Under the local authority’s policy free transport for children with special educational needs was provided to the nearest suitable school. The local authority decided H School was also suitable for J and it was nearer to the respondent’s home than B School. The additional travel costs to B School were estimated to be from £190 to £300 per year depending on whether or not shared transport was used. The council provided a statement of special educational needs (SSEN) naming both schools, confirming that B School was the parent’s favoured choice but that, as H School was nearer to the respondent’s home, under its policy the parents were responsible for all travelling expenses and arrangements. The parents appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) to seek a decision that only B School should be named in the SSEN as H School could not meet J’s needs (so making the local authority responsible for paying the additional transport costs). The F-tT accepted H School could meet J’s needs and was an appropriate placement for him. However, it decided it was not an inefficient use of resources for B School alone to be named in Part 4 of J’s SSEN, given the small difference in transport costs and other factors including there being an established communication peer group at B School. The local authority appealed to the Upper Tribunal (UT) and the case was heard before a three-judge panel. It dismissed the appeal and the local authority appealed to the Court of Appeal. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	there was a relevant contest within section 326(1A)(b) of the Education Act 1996 between the parents and the local authority: the appellant wanted to specify H School and would only include B School if the parents paid for J’s transport to it. If parents are unable to afford transport costs to their preferred schools then their preference would be denied and it was difficult to see a principled basis for saying a dual placement within an SSEN may be a matter of educational provision depending on whether or not the parents paid for the transport costs or made other alternative arrangements (paragraphs 36 to 39); 
2.	the F-tT was right to consider comparative travel costs for all suitable schools if that issue was put into play by the local authority. The F-tT was dealing with a matter of educational provision namely which school was to be specified. The parent’s sole preference was B School and so it had to be included unless J’s attendance was incompatible with the efficient use of resources. To say the F-tT could not consider transport costs was contrary to the local authority’s own approach in completing Part 4 of J’s SSEN and contrary to paragraph 3(3)(b) of Schedule 27 to the 1996 Act (paragraphs 40 to 46);
3.	the approach of both the F-tT and the UT was not contrary to section 326(1A) or paragraph 3 of Schedule 27. The UT’s reasoning and approach was in general correct and conclusive (subject to one reservation). The F-tT was justified in weighing the transport costs involved in sending J to B School as part of the matters requiring consideration under paragraph 3 of Schedule 27. Its conclusion that a decision to specify the name of B School in Part 4 of the SSEN would not constitute an inefficient use of resources was properly open to it. The UT correctly decided that the F-tT had jurisdiction under section 326 and its conclusion involved no error of law (paragraphs 47 to 48).

Disability living allowance – suspension of payment while “undergoing medical or other treatment as an in-patient … in a hospital or similar institution” – care home without qualified nursing staff
The claimant had severe learning difficulty and other conditions and was resident in a care home (“The Lodge”), which was registered as a care home only, not as a nursing home, and did not purport to provide nursing care. The cost of his accommodation was paid by the National Health Service. He had been in receipt of the higher rate of the mobility component and the highest rate of the care component of disability living allowance while living at home, but a decision was made that neither component was payable while he was in the care home on the ground that he was being “maintained free of charge while undergoing medical or other treatment as an in-patient … in a hospital or similar institution under the [National Health Service Act 2006]” within regulations 8 (care component) and 12A (mobility component) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991. He appealed against the decision, contending that the fact that The Lodge did not have qualified nursing staff meant that he was not in a “hospital or similar institution” and therefore that neither regulation 8 nor regulation 12A applied. Regulation 9, which provides for suspension of payment of the care component for periods of residence in care homes, was amended in 2002 to exclude services provided pursuant to the National Health Service Act 2006. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, finding that The Lodge was a “hospital or similar institution”. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal judge made an interim decision holding that “medical or other treatment” in regulations 8 and 12A did not extend to the exercise of care and skill by trained carers with no medical or nursing qualification and that in order to fall within the regulations there had to be at least some “treatment” being received in the institution in which the respondent was an “in-patient”. He further held that an ordinary care home not providing medical or nursing treatment was not a “hospital or similar institution”, and that the fact that the respondent was receiving some medical treatment outside The Lodge did not therefore bring him within the scope of either regulation. The judge left open for subsequent determination the question whether it would make any difference if the claimant was in receipt of significant treatment, at The Lodge, from healthcare professionals not employed by The Lodge. He gave the Secretary of State permission to appeal the interim decision to the Court of Appeal. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	although it was common ground that the court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against an interim decision of the Upper Tribunal, it would have been much better for the judge to have determined the outstanding issue so that the court could have considered the appeal by reference to a full set of relevant facts without being required to make an assumption that the respondent did not receive treatment from or under the supervision of doctors or professionally qualified nurses at The Lodge (paragraphs 37, 65 and 71);
2.	on that assumption, the respondent could not be said to be undergoing “medical or other treatment”. Following Minister of Health v Home for Incurables at Leamington Spa [1954] Ch 530 and other cases, such treatment includes nursing, but the nursing must be of a professional character, that is, administered by, or under the direction or supervision of, a qualified doctor, nurse or nurses. The various references in those cases to professional qualifications and training were fundamental to the reasoning of the court and later developments in nursing did not undermine the basis of the decisions or call for a different approach: Chief Adjudication Officer v White (reported as R(IS) 18/94) and Chief Adjudication Officer v Botchett (reported as R(IS) 10/96) also considered (paragraphs 54, 75 to 78);
3.	the amendment of regulation 9 in 2002 so that it did not apply where services were funded by the National Health Service had no obvious policy rationale, but, whatever led to it, the amendment could not alter the meaning of regulation 8 and there was no reason why the court should step in to modify the consequences of the amendment by a strained interpretation of regulation 8. While it was undesirable for double provision to be made from public funds in respect of a single set of care and mobility needs, there was not a sufficiently clear-cut policy behind the drafting of the regulations to justify a departure from their natural meaning as elucidated by the authorities (paragraphs 57 and  69);
4.	the court having found that the claimant was not undergoing “medical or other treatment” it really followed that he was not “an in-patient … in a hospital or similar institution”, but it was not necessary to give separate consideration to that question and the wording of regulations 8 and 12A needed to be considered as a whole and not broken down into separate or prioritised parts (paragraphs 58, 68 and 79);
5.	the receipt of medical or other treatment from healthcare professionals away from The Lodge was treatment as an out-patient and could not bring the claimant within the scope of the regulations. The whole tenor of regulations 8 and 12A is that the person is undergoing treatment “in” the institution where he is maintained free of charge and that is underlined by the words “as an in-patient”. Those words are an integral part of the condition and qualify “medical or other treatment” just as much as they qualify “maintained free of charge … in a hospital or similar institution” (paragraphs 59 and 79).

Special educational provision – education otherwise than in a school – parents wishing education partly at school and partly at home – meaning of “education in a school”
The father of a child with special needs appealed against the contents of a statement naming a particular maintained special school which he should attend on a full-time basis. He had been attending a maintained mainstream primary school on a part-time basis and receiving a home-based programme using Advanced Behavioural Analysis (ABA) for 30 hours a week. The parents wished him to continue attending that school on a part-time basis with home-based ABA of 40 hours weekly. Section 319 of the Education Act 1996 provides that where a local authority is satisfied that it would be inappropriate for the special educational provision which a learning difficulty of a child calls for, or any part of such provision, to be made in a school, it may arrange for the provision (or, as the case may be, for that part of it) to be made otherwise than in a school. Section 316 provides that where a child with special educational needs should be educated in a school, he must be educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with the wishes of his parent, or the provision of efficient education for other children. In TM v London Borough of Hounslow [2009] EWCA Civ 859 it was held that in addressing the question under section 319 it was not enough for the local authority to ask simply whether the school can meet the statement of needs but it has to see if a school would not be suitable or would not be proper, and to do so must take into account all the circumstances of the case in hand. The First-tier Tribunal decided that it was not inappropriate for any of the provision to be made in a school, and applying section 316 decided that part 4 of the statement should name the mainstream school on a full-time basis with a carefully planned transition programme in place leading to full-time attendance over a six-month period. ABA would continue to be delivered at home but decrease in proportion to the increasing number of school hours until the transition was complete at which point a further review would be necessary. The father appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The local authority argued that the wishes of the parents were not for education in a school but for education at home with an element of co-location at school and, having concluded for the purposes of section 319 that it would not be inappropriate for the child’s needs to be met at the special school, the tribunal should not have gone any further as section 316 did not apply, citing the Department for Education and Skills 2001 Guidance on Inclusive Schooling, which indicated that a child had to be in mainstream education for at least 51 per cent of the time in order to count as being in mainstream education.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	education at home with an element of co-location at a school is education at a school, at least in part, and while there may be a de minimis requirement for what is to count as attendance at a school, the parents’ proposal for about 30 per cent attendance was well above any de minimis threshold (paragraph 22); 
2.	the 2001 Guidance was designed to prevent local authorities from claiming that children with special educational needs were in mainstream education when in fact they were not and had no relevance to the section 316 exercise and, as a matter of law, it could not provide authoritative interpretation of the statute (paragraph 22);
3.	having decided under section 319(1)(a) that it was not inappropriate for any of the provision to be made in a school, and having carried out the section 316 exercise, the tribunal should then have considered whether under section 319(1)(b) it was inappropriate for part of the provision to be made in a school and, in failing to separate out the issues in the case, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law (paragraphs 23 and 24).
The Upper Tribunal judge remitted the case to a completely differently constituted tribunal for rehearing.

Capital – claimant with two bank accounts with same bank – whether overdraft to be deducted from credit balance in calculation of capital
The claimant had two bank accounts with the same bank, a Bonus Saver account, which was in credit by £7,700.09 and a Student Additions account, which was overdrawn by £1,994.90. A decision-maker, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, awarded the claimant income-based jobseeker’s allowance on the basis that he possessed capital of £7,700.09. As that figure was in excess of £6,000, he applied regulation 116(1) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996, producing a tariff income of £7 per week in the calculation of the claimant’s entitlement to benefit. The claimant appealed, arguing that the sum produced by the deduction of his overdraft from his credit balance should have been used as the amount of his capital. The tribunal dismissed his appeal, holding that it was bound by R(SB) 2/83 to decide that the gross value of the claimant’s capital, without any deduction for the amount of his overdraft, fell to be applied in calculating the claimant’s entitlement to income-based jobseeker’s allowance. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal directed the claimant to produce bank mandate agreements, and all applicable bank terms and conditions as at the relevant time. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had overlooked the crucial fact that the claimant’s capital consisted of bank accounts with the same bank and thus he was actually both a creditor and a debtor of the same body, unlike the situation which arose in R(SB) 2/83. In those circumstances, it should have sought production of the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant accounts and should have taken account of the meaning and effect of those terms and conditions in calculating “the current market … value” of the claimant’s capital consisting of the balances of those accounts for the purposes of regulation 111. In failing to proceed in that manner the tribunal had erred in law (paragraph 12);
2.	the documents produced to the Upper Tribunal clearly showed that the agreement between the claimant and the bank conferred a contractual right on the bank as creditor to debit at any time without prior notice any of a customer’s accounts with it which were in credit with funds sufficient to reduce or repay any indebtedness which that customer might have to the bank (paragraph 15);
3.	the “market value” of the balance in the Bonus Saver account was its net value after deduction of the amount of the claimant’s overdraft in his Student Additions account. Thus for the purposes of regulation 111, at the relevant time the market value of the claimant’s Bonus Saver account was £5,705.19 and no tariff income was applicable to the claimant in the calculation of his entitlement to income-based jobseeker’s allowance (paragraph 16).

He had a mental disorder classified since September 2008 as a psychopathic disorder. Prior to that date his mental disorder had been classified as mental illness and psychopathic disorder. He had been continuously detained under the Act for over 23 years. He applied to the First-tier Tribunal (mental health) for discharge and for his appeal to be heard in public, so that the public could be aware of what he saw as failings in the system, especially in relation to his diagnosis. Rule 38(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008 provides that hearings must be held in private unless the tribunal considers that it is in the interests of justice for the hearing to be held in public. The tribunal heard evidence from two medical experts, one of whom expressed concern at the possibly adverse effect of negative publicity in the longer term, while the other thought that those considerations were on balance outweighed by the negative impact of refusing a public hearing. The tribunal found that a public hearing would be unlikely to attract much if any media interest, but thought “adverse or no publicity” would be a serious disappointment, and hinder the patient’s progress in the longer term. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal. It was common ground that the Upper Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the decision to refuse a public hearing. 
Held, in an interim decision, that:
1.	any exception to the open justice principle in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights must be clearly justified and, although in the generality of cases the protection of the interests of mental health patients will justify an exception to that principle, the main consideration is the protection of the interests of the patient (paragraphs 16 to 28);
2.	the tribunal had started from the wrong point in relying on what it described as “relevant principles”, which were not so much principles as reasons given by eminent judges to justify the general principle of open justice, instead of directing attention to Article 6 and its exceptions. It is a fundamental principle, both in common law and in Article 6, that open justice is a right, which does not require justification on a case by case basis and that it is the exceptions which need to be justified (paragraphs 41 to 43);
3.	the factors to be considered in any application for a public hearing are: (a) whether it is consistent with the subjective and informed wishes of the patient (assuming that he is competent to make an informed choice); (b) whether it will have an adverse effect on his mental health in the short or long term, taking account of the views of those treating him and any other expert views; (c) whether there are any other special factors for or against a public hearing; (d) whether practical arrangements can be made for an open hearing without disproportionate burden on the hospital or relevant authority (paragraphs 29 and 44);
4.	applying those factors to the present case: (a) was clearly satisfied as the applicant had waived his right to privacy and there was no dispute that he was able to make an informed choice; although the arguments under head (b) were finely balanced, and reflected a degree of speculation, the views of the patient himself, supported by his own expert, should carry considerable weight in the absence of other countervailing factors, and factor (c) was satisfied because the case was out of the ordinary and for that reason merited special consideration, in that the patient had been kept in detention at public expense over 23 years, often in conditions of high security, and there had recently been a change in his diagnosis, which potentially gave the case some heightened public significance (paragraph 45 to 48).

The Three-judge Panel set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and directed a further hearing by the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence as to practicalities and costs, previous practice, and practices elsewhere in the United Kingdom, in Europe and in other common law counties.
Held, in a final decision following a further hearing, that:
5.	once the tests in (2) above for establishing a right to a public hearing have been satisfied, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (reinforced by article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) requires that a patient should have the same or substantially equivalent right of access to a public hearing as a non-disabled person who has been deprived of his or her liberty and such a right can only be denied a patient if enabling that right imposes a truly disproportionate burden on the State (paragraph 22);
6.	how the right to a public hearing can practically and proportionately be achieved will depend on the facts of each individual case, including the facilities available in the hospital in question (paragraph 23).
The Panel directed that the First-tier Tribunal hold a public hearing of the applicant’s appeal at which the applicant and his representatives were to be enabled to attend in person in the same hearing room as the hearing took place.

Special educational provision – naming of school – unreasonable public expenditure – whether reasonableness limited to educational benefits
The statement of special educational needs as amended ahead of the child’s transfer to secondary school named a local authority maintained special day school as meeting her needs. The parents appealed, contending that a named independent residential school better met her needs. Section 9 of the Education Act 1996 as amended provides that in exercising or performing all their respective powers and duties under the Education Acts, the Secretary of State and local authorities shall have regard to the general principle that pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents, so far as that is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure. In assessing the comparative costs of the two schools the First-tier Tribunal stated that it had no jurisdiction to deal with social and health reasons however compelling they might be and dismissed her appeal. It decided that the child should be placed at the day school and placed a year below her chronological age. The parents appealed to the Upper Tribunal, contending that there had been an unlawful failure by the tribunal to consider wider benefits in deciding whether additional public expenditure would be unreasonable, relying on O v London Borough of Lewisham [2007] EWHC 2130 (Admin); [2007] ELR 633. The local authority argued that O was wrongly decided and in conflict with the House of Lords’ interpretation in B v London Borough of Harrow [2000] 1 WLR 223; [2000] ELR 109. The authority maintained that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation as amended made no distinction between a “local education authority” and other functions of the local authority, section 9 (and Schedule 27, which applied to cases where parents preference was for a maintained school) dealt with the Education Act and educational provision, and the exercise that faced a local authority (and a tribunal on appeal) was the balance between educational advantages and additional cost.  
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	local authorities and the tribunal should inform themselves of the full picture and adopt a holistic approach in accordance with the natural meaning of the term “public expenditure” in section 9, and also with the phrase “efficient use of resources” in paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 27: citing W v Leeds City Council and Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal [2005] EWCA Civ 988; [2005] ELR 617, which was followed in O (paragraphs 23 and 24);
2.	the House of Lords’ interpretation in B of the word “resources” in paragraph 3(3) did not require an interpretation of section 9 which confined “expenditure” to expenditure by the local education authority. The legislation, as further amended in 2010, enabled and indeed obliged the local authority and the tribunal on appeal to look at the public purse generally, and not exclusively the costs that fell within the education budget (paragraph 27);
3.	accordingly the tribunal had misdirected itself in law in failing to take account of the wider benefits to which they referred when deciding whether the extra public expenditure that would be incurred if the parents’ preferred school were identified as the School in Part 4 of the statement would or would not be “unreasonable” on the facts of the case (paragraph 30);
4.	in deciding first that the child should be placed at the day school and then deciding that what would otherwise (on their own finding) be an unsuitable placement should be made suitable by her being placed a year below her chronological age (without even that being reflected, as it needed to be, in an amendment to Part 3), it appeared that the tribunal had erred in making the provision fit the placement, rather than adopting the correct approach, which was to decide first what provision was required and specify it in Part 3, and then, secondly, to go on to decide at which school that provision was to be made: S v Swansea [2000] ELR 315 cited (paragraph 36).
The judge remitted the case for rehearing before a differently constituted tribunal.

Tribunal practice and procedure – late appeal against cancellation of registration as childcare provider – review of decision to extend time for appeal 
The appellant was registered by OFSTED as a provider of childcare under the Childcare Act 2006. Following an incident in March 2009, criminal proceedings were started against her and OFSTED suspended and eventually, in August 2009, cancelled her registration. She did not appeal against that decision within the 28-day time limit specified in the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008. In October 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to continue with the criminal proceedings. In December 2009 the appellant applied for a waiver of the disqualification. OFSTED refused to consent to a waiver and she appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal. In June 2010 she sought permission to appeal out of time under rule 5(3) of the Procedure Rules against the August 2009 cancellation decision. OFSTED objected to her application. The application was granted by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 20 July 2010 and OFSTED applied to vary or suspend that decision. On 27 July the First-tier Tribunal judge refused to vary or suspend but adjourned the substantive hearing. OFSTED then applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. On 17 August 2010 the First-tier Tribunal judge refused permission to appeal but reviewed her decision and substituted a decision to the same effect but with more detailed reasons. The Upper Tribunal gave OFSTED permission to appeal and suspended the effect of the decision being challenged. The waiver appeal was adjourned pending the Upper Tribunal proceedings. OFSTED sought guidance from the Upper Tribunal on how that power should be exercised.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the power under rule 5(3)(a) was expressed in deliberately wide terms and the facts of each case varied enormously. The Rules already provided that the power must be exercised fairly and justly and so as to avoid delay “so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues” and any further guidance by the Upper Tribunal would either be so general as to be meaningless or would be likely to spark time-consuming and unnecessary satellite litigation (paragraph 21);
2.	in making her decision of August 2010 the First-tier Tribunal judge was exercising the power under section 9(4)(b) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to amend on review the reasons given for the decision, which meant that the decisions of 20 and 27 July and 17 August 2010 must be read together and, although there was no right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision to carry out the review, the reasons given on 17 August 2010 became part of the First-tier Tribunal’s reasons for the decision that was under appeal to the Upper Tribunal (paragraph 24);
3.	in the absence of specific provisions in statute or the regulations OFSTED must consider on the facts of each case whether an applicant for a waiver is required to accept the facts behind the cancellation or the appropriateness of the cancellation decision, or whether there has been a change of circumstances and to the extent that it had been suggested otherwise in this case, the Chief Inspector was at risk of unlawfully fettering her discretion (paragraph 32);
4.	subject to the inquisitorial and facilitative roles of the tribunal and in the absence of argument to the contrary, the approach adopted by the First-tier Tribunal and its predecessor appeared correct: that is that in an appeal against the cancellation of registration the burden of justifying the cancellation is on OFSTED, while in an appeal against a determination of OFSTED to withhold consent to a waiver of disqualification, the burden is on the appellant (paragraphs 35 to 37);
5.	the First-tier Tribunal did not take into account matters that it should not have taken into account or fail to take account of matters of which it should have taken account and in the end gave lengthy and rational reasons for the decision to accept the cancellation appeal out of time and there was no basis for the Upper Tribunal to substitute its own judgment on the circumstances and facts of the case (paragraphs 40 and 41).	

The judge lifted the suspension of the effect of the First-tier Tribunal’s decision and directed that the outstanding appeals be listed for hearing.

Information rights – environmental information – local property searches and enquiries
The second respondent, PALI Ltd, a private search company, made a request by email to Kirklees Council for access to the information held by the Council which would allow them to answer questions on the Con29R, a standard form approved by the Law Society for enquiries relating to conveyancing of domestic property. They requested the information free of charge, asserting that the questions related to environmental issues as defined in Article 21 of the Directive in the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (the EIR), which gave domestic effect to Council Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, which was adopted to implement the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. The Council replied stating that it did not consider that the information requested should be made available under the EIR as access to the local land charges register was governed by the Local Land Charges Act and Rules, and that any inspection of the register and the information it contained could be made upon payment of the appropriate fee, referring PALI to the Local Authorities (Charges for Property Searches) Regulations 2008 for the statutory basis for the fees charged. The company requested a review of the response under the Council’s internal complaints procedure, and the monitoring officer upheld the decision, relying on OneSearch Direct Holdings Ltd v City of York Council [2010] EWHC 590 (Admin) as confirmation that the Council’s current charging regime for local search information was lawful. The company complained to the Information Commissioner, who made an express finding that all the information at issue was environmental information within the meaning of the EIR, citing the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (the F-tT) in East Riding of Yorkshire Council v Information Commissioner and York Place (EA/2009/0069) in which the tribunal had dismissed arguments from that Council in respect of charging to provide similar information. The Commissioner indicated that reliance on OneSearch was misplaced and decided that the request from PALI was a valid request under the EIR that required the Council to make the requested information available free of charge. The Council appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal was transferred to the Upper Tribunal under rule 19(3) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, as amended, in light of the importance of the issue involved and the wide implications of the outcome for local authorities. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the Commissioner had made an express finding that the information requested fell with the definition of environmental information within regulation 2(1)(c) of the EIR, because it was information about plans or measures or activities that affected or were likely to affect the elements of the environment and, as that finding had not been challenged at all in the appeal, the Upper Tribunal heard no argument on the issue and did not review the finding (paragraphs 35 to 39);
2.	it followed that all such information held by local authorities, in any form and whether at present held on a public register or not, was in principle subject to the free access provisions of those regulations, as held by the First-tier Tribunal in East Riding. That was self-evident on the plain wording of the Regulations themselves notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other legislative provision or rule of law, by virtue of regulation 5(6) which prescribed expressly that such provisions were not to apply to prevent disclosure in accordance with the EIR. OneSearch was to be distinguished since application of the EIR was not considered in that case (paragraphs 40 to 43);
3.	the words used by PALI in the e-mail were clear and unambiguous and amounted to a valid request under regulation 5 of the EIR for access to inspect the information identified. The word “request” in regulation 5 of the EIR was a common word that needed no qualification or further definition and was intentionally left wide and unrestricted for policy reasons. Even if the Council had been in any doubt as to what information was sought, clarification could, and should, have been sought under regulation 9 of the EIR (paragraphs 53 to 83);
4.	there is no suggestion in the Convention, the Directive or the EIR that a public authority can impose charges on the public seeking personal inspection of environmental information which that public authority holds on the basis of recovering storage or retrieval costs. It is clear from the wording of regulation 8(2)(b) of the EIR  that charging a fee can be permissible only in connection with the provision of a copy, or a supply of the requested information in some other way than allowing it to be examined in situ. That is consistent with regulation 4(2) of the Local Authorities (Charges for Property Searches) Regulations, which provides that charges do not apply in the case of free statutory information, except to the extent that a local authority is providing a service which is supplementary or incidental to that described in the enactment in question (paragraphs 96 to 99).
5.	per curiam: it is not a valid ground of objection to a point being advanced in an appeal such as this that it had not been raised or relied on earlier, as these are public law proceedings whose object is to give effect to the true obligations of public authorities as to access to information and not to anything else (paragraph 47).

Jurisdiction of Information Commissioner and tribunal – whether extends to determination of public law questions of reasonableness 
The complainant, Mr Morrissey, had made a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to the Office of Communications (OFCOM), a regulator and public authority, to publish individual broadcasters’ detailed equal opportunities returns. OFCOM was required by section 337 of the Communications Act 2003 to publish arrangements made in pursuance of equal opportunities requirements, and had published aggregate summary data. OFCOM refused to disclose the desired information, relying on section 44 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which provides an exemption from disclosure where it is prohibited under any enactment, and section 393 of the 2003 Act, which bars disclosure without consent except for the purpose of facilitating the carrying out by OFCOM of any of its functions. Mr Morrissey complained to the Information Commissioner, who adopted the approach of the Information Tribunal in Hoyte v Civil Aviation Authority (EA/2007/0101), and decided that he should consider whether OFCOM had acted reasonably in declining to disclose the information in pursuance of its functions under the 2003 Act. The Commissioner concluded that OFCOM had acted reasonably, and Mr Morrissey’s complaint failed. On appeal by Mr Morrissey, the First-tier Tribunal, with minor corrections, agreed with the Information Commissioner’s approach. OFCOM appealed to the Upper Tribunal, which considered it appropriate to hear and determine the appeal as it appeared to raise two issues of general importance, relating to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and, on appeal, the tribunal. It was argued for OFCOM, relying on O’Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237, that a challenge to the reasonableness of OFCOM’s decision could be brought only by way of judicial review in a court exercising public law jurisdiction. For the Commissioner it was asserted, relying on Boddington v British Transport Police [1999] 2 AC 143 and other cases, that the modern approach required a presumption that it is for the Commissioner (subject to an appeal to the tribunal) to determine whether the only reasonable course that is open to the public authority in the circumstances of a particular request is to disclose the requested information. If there were no such presumption the question was whether, on their true construction, relevant statutory provisions empowered, and indeed required, the Information Commissioner to consider a public law question of reasonableness.
Held, allowing the appeal to a limited extent, that:
1.	while the authorities show that there is no presumption that public law questions can only be raised by invoking the courts’ supervisory jurisdiction, that does not mean that there is a presumption that the Information Commissioner, who is a regulator and not a tribunal, can determine public law issues, and the First-tier Tribunal’s functions are limited by reference to the functions of the Commissioner  (paragraphs 38 to 47);
2.	the relevant functions of the Commissioner for present purposes were limited to making a decision whether, in any specified respect, a request for information made by a complainant to a public authority had been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part I of the 2000 Act.  That might well require a view to be taken on the construction of a potentially relevant statutory bar on disclosure in other legislation, but in the circumstances of the present case it did not extend to asking the questions which might be asked on the subject of reasonableness by a court of supervisory jurisdiction examining a challenge to OFCOM’s failure to exercise powers available to it under the 2003 Act: Oxfam v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2009] EWHC 3078 (Ch) distinguished (paragraphs 52 to 63);
3.	the tribunal in Hoyte had therefore erred in proceeding on the basis that either it or the Commissioner had a general jurisdiction to determine whether a public authority had acted unreasonably when exercising a discretion not to disclose information, and the Information Commissioner and tribunal in the present case had erred in adopting that approach. However, that error of law was immaterial to the outcome in the present case as the Commissioner was correct to conclude that OFCOM had dealt with the request for information in accordance with Part 1 of the 2000 Act (paragraphs 1 and 62).

She received £170,000 compensation from solicitors for their negligence in dealing with her claim for compensation against a surgeon in respect of medical negligence and the money was paid into a trust fund. The Secretary of State decided that she was no longer entitled to income support because she had capital in excess of the statutory limit of £16,000. She appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, which upheld the Secretary of State’s decision, concluding that the disregards in paragraphs 12 and 12A of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 for certain payments made in consequence of any personal injury to the claimant did not apply. The disregard in paragraph 12 applies to the funds of a trust derived from a payment made in consequence of any personal injury to the claimant, but the tribunal considered the chain of causation in the claimant’s case between the payment and the personal injuries sustained too remote. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. It was agreed that the claim against the solicitors was only for the damages that would have been awarded against or received from the surgeon if the solicitors had not been negligent.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
The First-tier Tribunal had failed to give due weight to the meaning of the words “in consequence of”. While there might be cases where elements in damages were excluded from the disregards in paragraphs 12 and 12A, in the present case, where the whole of the £170,000 amounted to damages in respect of what would have been claimed from the negligent surgeon, the actual wording of the disregards clearly applied (paragraph 13).

Ms Czop and Ms Punakova arrived separately in the United Kingdom (UK) some years before 2004 when their respective countries of origin, Poland and the Czech Republic, joined the European Union (EU). Thereafter, Ms Czop and Ms Punakova remained in the UK and established themselves in self-employment and both also had a child in education for which they were the primary carer (Ms Czop stopped work before her child started school). In 2008 both Ms Czop and Ms Punakova separately claimed income support. Each was refused benefit on the grounds that they were persons from abroad. They both appealed. In each case the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) allowed the appeal holding that the claimant had a right to reside in the UK and was habitually resident (not a person from abroad). The F-tTs granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal against the decisions to the Upper Tribunal (UT). Following an oral hearing the UT judge decided to refer various questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerning whether anyone in similar circumstances had a right to reside in the UK on the basis that: (a) Regulation 1612/68 applied, together with the reasoning of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Baumbast and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] ECR I-7091, London Borough of Harrow v Ibrahim [2010] ECR I-1065 and Teixeira v London Borough of Lambeth [2010] ECR I-1107; (b) there was a general principle of EU law equating the position of workers and the self-employed; (c) it would impede or deter the freedom of establishment if the claimants did not have a right to reside; or (d) some other basis. During the hearing before the CJEU the Secretary of State accepted that both claimants had a right to reside for the purposes of their claims to benefit: Ms Czop by reason of five years residence and Ms Punakova as the primary carer of a child in education by reason of her partner having been a worker. Accordingly, the CJEU did not need to consider whether or not there was a right of residence on some other basis of European law. 
 Held, that:
1.	Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community must be interpreted as conferring on the person who is the primary carer of a migrant worker’s, or a former migrant worker’s, child who is attending educational courses in the host Member State a right of residence in that State, although that provision cannot be interpreted as conferring such a right on the person who is the primary carer of the child of a person who is self-employed (paragraph 40); 
2.	Article 16(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States must be interpreted as meaning that a European Union citizen who is a national of a Member State which recently acceded to the European Union may, pursuant to that provision, rely on a right of permanent residence where he or she has resided in the host Member State for a continuous period of more than five years, part of which was completed before the accession of the former State to the European Union, provided that the residence was in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 7(1) of Directive 2004/38 (paragraph 40).

Housing benefit – eligible rent – service charges in sheltered accommodation
The claimant was a man with severe learning disabilities and shared a housing association property with four other tenants all of whom had similar difficulties. The residents received 24-hour care from staff provided by the housing association. Each tenant had their own bedroom and they shared communal rooms, including a kitchen, bathroom, and two sitting rooms. The resident’s rent included a charge of some £20 weekly for the cost of heating and cleaning the communal rooms. The council decided that these costs could not be met by housing benefit as they were ineligible service charges as defined in Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 to the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (the Regulations). On the claimant’s appeal, the question before the First-tier Tribunal was whether the claimant resided in sheltered accommodation for the purpose of the Regulations. If he did, he was entitled to have his share of the costs of heating and cleaning the communal rooms included in his eligible rent when calculating his housing benefit entitlement. The First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) concluded that the accommodation was not sheltered. On the claimant’s further appeal, the Upper Tribunal judge concluded that the F-tT had applied an unduly restrictive definition of sheltered accommodation and upheld the claimant’s appeal. The council appealed against this decision. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the Upper Tribunal’s conclusion that the type of accommodation occupied by the respondent was sheltered accommodation for the purpose of the Regulations was correct. Parliament did not choose to define sheltered accommodation and the Court should not impose a prescriptive definition upon an inherently flexible concept which could take many different forms, and which now included very sheltered or extra care sheltered accommodation (paragraph 33);
2.	at one end of the spectrum, sheltered accommodation was distinguishable from “ordinary” accommodation because it incorporated particular features which are not normally found in “ordinary” accommodation and were designed to meet the needs of occupiers who were vulnerable in some way due to age or disability. The presence or absence of a particular feature, including self-contained accommodation, a warden or an emergency alarm system, was not determinative (paragraph 34); 
3.	at the other end of the spectrum, a care home was not sheltered accommodation. There would usually be more emphasis on care than accommodation in a care home and residents in care homes would usually occupy their rooms under licence whereas those having exclusive possession of their own living space within sheltered accommodation would be in occupation pursuant to a tenancy and so liable to pay the rent and service charges which were eligible for housing benefit purposes (paragraph 35).

Tribunal procedure and practice – tribunal jurisdiction in mental health cases – whether application on revocation of community treatment order lapses when new community treatment order made 
Tribunal procedure – whether tribunal may treat letter as application 
 The patient was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 for about two months. A community treatment order was then made, but she was subsequently recalled to hospital and the order was revoked. The hospital managers then referred her case to the First-tier Tribunal as required by section 68(7) of the Act. While the case was pending, a new community treatment order was made and the patient returned to live in the community. Following correspondence with the patient’s solicitors, the First-tier Tribunal decided that a section 68(7) reference should generally be treated as lapsed if, before the hearing, the patient is again discharged from hospital back on to a community treatment order. However, it agreed to treat a letter from the solicitors as an application to the tribunal, under section 66(1)(ca), to consider whether or not to discharge the new community treatment order under section 72(1)(c). In correspondence the First-tier Tribunal had sought to distinguish section 68(7) references from other references and applications, which were the subject of AA v Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust [2009] UKUT 195 (AAC); [2011] AACR 37 and KF v Birmingham and Solihull NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust [2010] UKUT 185 (AAC); [2011] AACR 3, where the Upper Tribunal had decided that such proceedings did not lapse when a community treatment order was made. The patient’s solicitors appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	whether or not the reference has lapsed depends on the nature of the reference, which is a matter of statutory interpretation and neither the overriding objective in rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) Rules 2008 (the HESC rules) nor the policy adopted by the First-tier Tribunal is relevant to the issue. Given that the legislation places a patient whose community treatment order has been revoked in the same position as any other patient detained under section 3, the reasoning in KF and AA governed the present case (paragraph 15);
2.	the subject matter of a reference under section 68(7) is not related to the circumstances that trigger it. The statutory conditions of detention under section 72 must be satisfied whether the patient is detained in hospital or released under a new order. Accordingly, the subject matter of the reference survives and in line with AA and KF it requires the tribunal to consider the position as at the date of the hearing (paragraph 16);
3.	the tribunal’s approach to lapsing was inconsistent with section 68(1) of the Act, which envisages that a section 68(7) reference might be ongoing in the case of a community patient (paragraph 17);
4.	there was therefore no scope in the present case for the solicitors’ correspondence to be treated as an application under section 66. The judge commented that the power to treat a document as having a particular status is in general a beneficial one and in accordance with the overriding objective, but it is subject to limits and it is not permissible to take that approach to override an unequivocal indication by a solicitor to the opposite effect, especially when its effect is to deprive a patient of the chance to time her section 66 application for later, should she not obtain her discharge on the reference. The power was appropriately exercised for the applicant’s advantage, not potential detriment (paragraphs 18 to 20);
5.	where a patient does not wish to co-operate or even participate in the proceedings, the tribunal must exercise its powers in a way that ensures that the patient’s best interests are protected, bearing in mind that there is a limit to what can be achieved without co-operation. The judge made suggestions as to the responsible exercise of case management in such cases, taking account of the overriding objective and, in particular, of the need to act proportionately under rule 2(2)(a) of the HESC Rules (paragraphs 21 to 26).	

The Upper Tribunal Judge remitted the case to the tribunal with directions.

The three appellants, all private tenants, each needed to occupy a property which contained one bedroom more than the number of bedrooms which the housing benefit legislation specified should be taken into account in determining their housing benefit entitlement. Mr Burnip and Ms Trengove were severely disabled and needed a second bedroom for an overnight carer, but their housing benefit was required to be calculated on the basis of the rent appropriate for a one bedroom flat. Mr Gorry’s housing benefit entitlement was required to be calculated on the basis that his two daughters would share a bedroom, but by reason of their disability it was not reasonable for them to do so. The appellants’ appeals against the amount of the housing benefit awards were dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal and then the Upper Tribunal. The appellants relied on unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1 (A1P1). It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that (i) that the cases fell within the ambit of A1P1, in that housing benefit is a “possession” and (ii) that disability is within the concluding words “or other status” of Article 14. 

Held, allowing the appeals, that:

1.	The appellants had established a prima facie case of discrimination within Article 14 on both the alternative bases for which they contended.  First, the legislation had a disparate adverse effect on disabled people. Malcolm v Lewisham LBC [2008] UKHL 43, relied on by the Secretary of State, did not provide the correct approach; it turned on the construction of section 24 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Further, in the particular circumstances the appellants’ case did not need to be based on statistical evidence. Secondly, the legislation failed to treat differently persons whose situations were significantly different, under the principle applied by the Strasbourg Court in Thlimmenos v Greece (2001) 31 EHRR 15. That principle could apply to require a State to take positive steps to allocate a greater share of public resources to a particular person or group; (paragraphs 10 to 18) 

2.	The Secretary of State had not established objective and reasonable justification for the discrimination. First, the wider benefits background, and in particular the other benefits to which the appellants (and in the case of Mr Gorry his family) were entitled, and the other elements involved in calculating the housing benefit entitlement, did not provide justification: it was wrong in principle to regard the appellants’ other subsistence benefits as being notionally available to go towards meeting the shortfall between their housing-related benefits and the rent. Secondly, it was not right to take into account the availability of discretionary housing payments. Thirdly, justification did not exist in a need to have a single set of rules applicable to all: the cost and human resource implications of making exceptions in the appellants’ and similar cases would be modest as such cases were likely to be relatively few in number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse and unlikely to undergo change or need regular monitoring. AM (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ 634 distinguished (paragraph 64). 

3.	The appropriate remedy for the Court of Appeal to grant was declaratory relief, leaving it to the Secretary of State to determine how to rectify the discrimination. Francis v SSWP [2006] 1 WLR 3202 applied (paragraphs 24). 

Note: the Court's Order as drawn up contained, in addition to a declaration, a provision remitting each case to the relevant council for reassessment of the additional sum “necessary to comply with this judgment and Article 14 for the period to which the appeal relates”.

Employment and support allowance – work capability assessment – remaining conscious – whether incapacity benefit case law relevant
The claimant had basilar migraine and was in receipt of employment and support allowance. She experienced episodes of dizziness, with sensations of blurred or altered vision associated with sensations of spinning. Following a medical examination, the Secretary of State decided, on supersession, to disallow her claim, awarding zero points in respect of the descriptors. The First-tier Tribunal upheld that decision and the claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The question was whether the episodes experienced by the claimant were sufficient to meet the test in paragraph 11 of Schedule 2 to the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008, as an episode of “altered consciousness, resulting in significantly disrupted awareness or concentration”. In its statement of reasons, the First-tier Tribunal cited R(IB) 2/07, where it was stated that a person had an episode of “altered consciousness” as defined in the relevant descriptor for incapacity benefit when he or she was no longer properly aware of his surroundings or his condition, so as to be incapable of any deliberate act. The tribunal noted the view of commentators that that approach might be no longer applicable to the different wording of the descriptor for employment and support allowance, but did not then go on to say, in terms, either that they did, or that they did not, apply the previous case law and if they did, to what extent.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the tribunal had erred in law as it was not possible to discern from its reasons whether or not its consideration of descriptor 11 was coloured by the requirement of R(IB) 2/07 that the sufferer had to be not capable of any deliberate act and the claimant was unable to tell why she lost (paragraph 9);
2.	the introduction, for employment and support allowance purposes, of a yardstick of whether an episode “result[s] in significantly disrupted awareness or concentration” provides a statutory measure of the severity of impact which renders inapplicable for employment and support allowance purposes the yardstick for incapacity benefit purposes created by R(IB) 2/07 that a claimant be “incapable of any deliberate act” (paragraph 14);
3.	the test of altered consciousness should be considered, and be seen to be considered, on the basis of the statutory wording in the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations, untrammelled as regards the extent of the effects of the episode by the decision reached on the incapacity benefit legislation in R(IB) 2/07.	

The judge remitted the case for rehearing before a differently constituted tribunal.

Armed Forces Compensation Scheme – whether service predominant cause of injury – meaning of “service” – claimant injured travelling to work
The claimant, a warrant officer in the army, was injured while walking to his regular place of work at the Citadelle in Lille from his normal residence in the city. He was knocked down on a pedestrian crossing by a hit and run driver who was never traced. His claim under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme was rejected on the ground that the circumstances did not fall within any of the provisions of article 10 of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces (Compensation Scheme) Order 2005. The First-tier Tribunal found that he was on duty at the time of the incident but disallowed his appeal, saying that even if service was the predominant cause of his injury, as required by article 7 of the Order, he did not satisfy any of the tests for travelling in article10(5). It was argued for the claimant that the starting point for travelling cases should be article 7, which provides that benefit is payable by reason of an injury which is caused wholly by service or where service is the predominant cause of the injury. In article 2(1) “service” is defined as “service as a member of the forces, except as provided in article 10”. Article 10, headed “Injury and death – inclusions”, then lists circumstances where benefit is payable for injury, including injury sustained in certain circumstances while travelling, none of which applied to the claimant. It was argued for the Secretary of State that article 10 was a deeming provision and provided a complete code for payment of benefit in travelling cases.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the words of article 10 fall a long way short of a clear indication that it was intended to be anything more than an inclusive provision for the cases prescribed, leaving cases falling outside that prescription to be decided according to the ordinary tests in article 7, 8 or 9 and, while it may be right in practice to make article 10 the starting point in a travelling case, because if one of its tests is satisfied the article may provide a straightforward answer that the claimant qualifies under the Scheme, it is necessary in a case where none of its tests is satisfied to go on and consider the relevant ordinary test. Accordingly, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in dismissing the claimant’s appeal for the reason it did (paragraphs 17 to 22);
2.	there is a fundamental distinction between travel to and from work and travel as part of work and in the circumstances of the present case, the claimant could not be regarded as doing his job as a member of the armed forces while walking from his apartment in Lille to the Citadelle, as he was doing something which was necessary for him to carry out that job, but he was not yet doing it (paragraphs 25 and 26);
3.	the line between service being merely part of the circumstances and being a cause of injury, can be a very fine one, as can that between service being a cause and being the predominant cause, and  it would be wrong to look only at the immediate or precipitating cause: Minister of Pensions v Chennell [1947] KB 250 cited. However, in the present case the injury, being a manifestation of a risk run by the general public using the streets of Lille, could not properly be regarded as caused by the claimant’s service (paragraphs 27 to 29).
4.	accordingly, the tribunal’s error of law was not material to the outcome and its decision was not to be set aside (paragraph 38).

The three appellants, all private tenants, each needed to occupy a property which contained one bedroom more than the number of bedrooms which the housing benefit legislation specified should be taken into account in determining their housing benefit entitlement. Mr Burnip and Ms Trengove were severely disabled and needed a second bedroom for an overnight carer, but their housing benefit was required to be calculated on the basis of the rent appropriate for a one bedroom flat. Mr Gorry’s housing benefit entitlement was required to be calculated on the basis that his two daughters would share a bedroom, but by reason of their disability it was not reasonable for them to do so. The appellants’ appeals against the amount of the housing benefit awards were dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal and then the Upper Tribunal. The appellants relied on unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1 (A1P1). It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that (i) that the cases fell within the ambit of A1P1, in that housing benefit is a “possession” and (ii) that disability is within the concluding words “or other status” of Article 14. 

Held, allowing the appeals, that:

1.	The appellants had established a prima facie case of discrimination within Article 14 on both the alternative bases for which they contended.  First, the legislation had a disparate adverse effect on disabled people. Malcolm v Lewisham LBC [2008] UKHL 43, relied on by the Secretary of State, did not provide the correct approach; it turned on the construction of section 24 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Further, in the particular circumstances the appellants’ case did not need to be based on statistical evidence. Secondly, the legislation failed to treat differently persons whose situations were significantly different, under the principle applied by the Strasbourg Court in Thlimmenos v Greece (2001) 31 EHRR 15. That principle could apply to require a State to take positive steps to allocate a greater share of public resources to a particular person or group; (paragraphs 10 to 18) 

2.	The Secretary of State had not established objective and reasonable justification for the discrimination. First, the wider benefits background, and in particular the other benefits to which the appellants (and in the case of Mr Gorry his family) were entitled, and the other elements involved in calculating the housing benefit entitlement, did not provide justification: it was wrong in principle to regard the appellants’ other subsistence benefits as being notionally available to go towards meeting the shortfall between their housing-related benefits and the rent. Secondly, it was not right to take into account the availability of discretionary housing payments. Thirdly, justification did not exist in a need to have a single set of rules applicable to all: the cost and human resource implications of making exceptions in the appellants’ and similar cases would be modest as such cases were likely to be relatively few in number, easy to recognise, not open to abuse and unlikely to undergo change or need regular monitoring. AM (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ 634 distinguished (paragraph 64). 

3.	The appropriate remedy for the Court of Appeal to grant was declaratory relief, leaving it to the Secretary of State to determine how to rectify the discrimination. Francis v SSWP [2006] 1 WLR 3202 applied (paragraphs 24). 

Note: the Court's Order as drawn up contained, in addition to a declaration, a provision remitting each case to the relevant council for reassessment of the additional sum “necessary to comply with this judgment and Article 14 for the period to which the appeal relates”.

Special educational provision – naming of school – parental preference – whether general obligation to have regard to parental preference operates independently of obligation to comply with parental preference in special educational needs cases – meaning of “public expenditure”
The mother of a child with special educational needs had appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the proposed placement by Bexley of the child in a maintained special school within the borough. The mother had expressed a preference for a special school maintained by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. If the parental preference were followed, Kensington and Chelsea would recoup the cost from Bexley. Paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 27 of the Education Act 1996 confers a right on the parent of a child with special educational needs who is seeking a place at a suitable maintained school to have their preference complied with, provided the placement would not be incompatible with the efficient use of resources. Section 9 of the 1996 Act creates a duty to have regard to the general principle that pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents so far as that is compatible with (inter alia) the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure. The First-tier Tribunal found that there would be no cost to the public purse as a whole in the child attending the out of borough school and, without setting out its reasoning, that both schools were suitable, but considered that the decision of the House of Lords in B v London Borough of Harrow and others [2000] 1 WLR 223; [2000] 1 All ER 876; [2000] ELR 109 was directly in point and binding, and that the detriment to the local authority’s resources under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 27 was sufficient to determine the appeal against the mother. The tribunal did not attempt to say in any detail how the Harrow case affected section 9. The mother appealed to the Upper Tribunal. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the natural reading of Lord Slynn’s remarks in Harrow about section 9 is that, in a case falling within paragraph 3(3), although section 9 continues to exist it has little or no independent function or operation distinct from the paragraph 3(3) test. However section 9 was not in issue in that case and those remarks did not form part of the ratio of the case, although even as obiter dicta, the remarks of a unanimous House of Lords clearly merit due respect (paragraphs 30 to 37);  
2.	the Upper Tribunal is bound to follow Harrow as to it being the resources of the placing authority that are relevant under paragraph 3, but “public expenditure” in section 9 has a different meaning from “resources” in paragraph 3(3) and is not restricted to the resources of the placing local authority: O v Lewisham [2007] EWHC 2130 and K v LB Hillingdon [2011] UKUT 71 (AAC); [2011] AACR 31 followed (paragraphs 37, 48 and 49);
3.	Lord Slynn’s remarks in Harrow are to be taken as a recognition that, in the light of the weakness of section 9, it will usually be paragraph 3(3) that will be determinative in cases where a place in a maintained school is sought. However, the distinct and separate exercise in section 9 must still be carried out in such cases. That is a rather broad discretionary exercise, to which the preference of the mother (and, in particular, the reasons for that preference: per Sedley LJ in C v Buckinghamshire County Council and the Special Educational Needs Tribunal [1999] EWCA Civ 926) are material, among other considerations. Given the breadth of that discretion, it was not possible to say that the tribunal’s error in failing to apply section 9 was not material (paragraphs 50 to 60);
4.	while section 9 must be properly applied as it stands to the exercise of the duty of naming a school imposed on the local authority by section 324, that did not exclude consideration of the financial impact on Bexley or any other relevant consideration, notwithstanding that there was in this instance no additional “public expenditure”, unreasonable or otherwise, involved (paragraphs 61 and 62).
The judge referred the case to the First-tier Tribunal (Health, Education and Social Care Chamber) for rehearing by the same tribunal.

Employment and support allowance – work capability assessment – continence – inability to control full evacuation of the bowel
Employment and support allowance – work capability assessment – mental cognitive and intellectual function assessment – whether restricted to incapability arising from mental illness or disablement 
The claimant suffered from irritable bowel syndrome and impaired concentration. In April 2009 the Secretary of State made a supersession decision that he was not entitled to employment and support allowance, following his completion of a questionnaire and an examination by an approved health care professional. He had stated on his questionnaire that he often had to go to the toilet 12 times a day and needed to be able to get to toilet facilities quickly, but that he could usually get to toilet without soiling. The only points-scoring descriptor identified in the health care professional’s report was “Risks losing control of bowels or bladder so that the claimant cannot control the full evacuation of the bowel … if not able to reach a toilet quickly”, scoring six points: Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 Schedule 2, unamended, paragraph 10(a)(vii). The claimant appealed and gave further evidence to the First-tier Tribunal. The tribunal confirmed the Secretary of State’s decision, re-affirming that descriptor 10(a)(vii) was appropriate and declining to consider any descriptor under paragraph 14 of Part 2 of Schedule 2 for loss of concentration, on the basis that his concentration was impaired because of physical difficulties and not through any mental disorder or mental illness. On his appeal to the Upper Tribunal he argued that there was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal indicating actual loss of control of the bowels and that the tribunal should have considered higher scoring descriptors for incontinence and also should have considered his concentration problems. The Secretary of State submitted that the higher continence descriptors required immediate, involuntary full evacuation of the bowel and there was no need for further explanation or investigation by the tribunal. The Secretary of State also supported the approach of the tribunal to the mental health descriptors on the basis that the descriptors under Part 2 referred to limitations on activities that stemmed from mental health problems.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the evidence before the tribunal raised potential qualification for descriptor 10(a)(iii) or (v) and in failing to ask questions about how often the claimant was actually unable to control the full evacuation of his bowel the tribunal had erred in law (paragraph 9 to 13);
2.	the focus must be on whether and how often the claimant actually is unable, as a result of his bodily disease or disablement, to control the full evacuation of the bowel and the relevant condition can be satisfied even though the claimant is able to exercise control for a certain amount of time (paragraph 14);
3.	whereas the heading “Physical disablement” pointed to the underlying cause of the effect on physical function tested in the descriptors in Part 1 of Schedule 2, the heading “Mental, cognitive and intellectual function assessment” in Part 2 pointed to the nature of the function that is affected, regardless of the underlying cause, suggesting that if one of those functions is affected in a way that meets the terms of a descriptor there is no need to attempt to separate out mental and physical origins (paragraph 20);
4.	regulation 19(5) of the Regulations merely provides that there is qualification for points under the whole of Schedule 2 only if the incapability to perform the activity in question arises from some specific bodily disease or disablement or some specific mental illness or disablement, and the interpretation contended for by the Secretary of State involved adding words to the Regulations, which could be justified only in cases of manifest absurdity or mistake or where there was a clear intention in the context of the Regulations as a whole that there should be an interpretation to that effect. The circumstances fell a long way short of that, and accordingly, the tribunal had failed to give an adequate reason for not looking further at the conditions of paragraph 14 of Schedule 2 (paragraph 20).
The judge remitted the case to a differently constituted tribunal within the Social Entitlement Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal for reconsideration.

Income support – prescribed categories of persons entitled – removal of entitlement for lone parents with children aged 12 or over – parent educating children at home – whether legislation ultra vires as in contravention of Education Act 1996
Human rights law – non-discrimination – removal of income support for lone parents with children aged 12 or over 
The claimant was a lone parent educating her 14-year old twins at home and was in receipt of income support. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1B to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 was amended with effect from 25 October 2008 to remove entitlement from lone parents whose children had reached the age of 12, in accordance with the government policy of encouraging lone parents to work. The Secretary of State decided that the claimant was no longer entitled to income support and she appealed to the First-tier Tribunal on the grounds that the decision infringed her rights under section 7 of the Education Act 1996 to educate her children at home, as she would not be able to continue to do so if she claimed jobseeker’s allowance. The tribunal upheld the decision of the Secretary of State. It found that there was no conflict between the income support rules and the 1996 Act because jobseeker’s allowance advisers were required to accommodate the circumstances of a home educating claimant when considering the contents of the jobseeker’s agreement. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal, arguing that the changes were invalid because they contravened the provisions of the 1996 Act and also that there was a breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights by virtue of discrimination on grounds of sex. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the Upper Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine whether subordinate legislation is invalid not only as being  beyond the scope of the enabling power but also if it conflicts with statutory rights already enacted by other primary legislation, provided there is no other reasonable way to exercise such rights. However, section 7 of the Education Act 1996 did not create a specific right to home educate and its provisions did not render the relevant changes to the income support regulations ultra vires or invalid: R v Secretary of State ex parte JCWI and R v Secretary of State ex parte B [1997] 1 WLR 275 cited (paragraph 21 to 28);
2.	subject to giving all parties a fair opportunity to make submissions on the relevant points, Convention rights must be considered by the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal no matter the stage at which they are raised by the parties (or, in a relevant case, even if they are not raised by the parties) and the Upper Tribunal is free (and is often obliged) to consider points of law on matters other than human rights law even if they have not been raised before the First-tier Tribunal (paragraphs 41 to 47);
3.	if the situation of the claimant in R (RJM) v Secretary of State [2008] UKHL 63; [2009] 2 All ER 556 engaged Article 1 of Protocol 1 (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) where his circumstances had changed, then even more so was that true of the present case where the claimant’s circumstances had not changed but there was a change in the law that meant that the claimant lost the entitlement that she had previously had (paragraphs 52 to 55);
4.	on the basis of the statistics a disproportionate number of female claimant had their lives made more difficult by the change in the regulations compared with the number of male claimants and that merited an examination of whether the changes pursued a legitimate aim in a proportionate way, although such a difference of treatment required a high threshold of irrationality or disproportionality before the courts would interfere (paragraphs 60 to 61);
5.	the Secretary of State had provided a rational explanation for the policy of the law in this case and  the methods of achieving the objectives of that policy were proportionate. The legal position in the present case was well within the State’s wide margin of appreciation that the State had in the implementation of social policy and in economic matters (paragraphs 62 to 64).

Consumer credit licensing – validity of bill of sale as security for loan – whether void if borrower’s signature witnessed by employee of the lending company who arranges the transaction on behalf of the lender
The appellant companies lent money on the security of second hand cars. The security document was in the form of a bill of sale intended to comply with the Bills of Sale (1878) Amendment Act 1882 (the1882 Act). Section 10 of that Act provides that the execution of a bill of sale by the grantor (ie borrower) “shall be attested by one or more credible witnesses, not being a party or parties thereto”. By section 8 a bill which is not duly attested is void. The appellants were entitled to carry on their business pending an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against the withdrawal of their consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The appellants’ standard practice was that the borrower’s signature of the bill of sale was witnessed by the employee (referred to as “underwriter”) of the appellants who had arranged the entire transaction with the borrower, and was the only representative of the lending company with whom the borrower dealt. The First-tier Tribunal gave a decision on five preliminary issues which had been framed in relation to the appeal, one of which was whether the manner of attestation rendered the bills void. The appellants contended that their practice was in accordance with the well established law that “although a party cannot attest a bill of sale, his agent or manager may do so”: Peace v Brookes [1895] 2 QB 451. However the First-tier Tribunal held that bills were void because the underwriter’s attestation must be attributed to the lending company under the principles of corporate attribution expounded in Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Limited v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500. The First-tier Tribunal directions for the hearing of the preliminary issues had incorporated an agreed direction that there should be no appeal against the decision of those issues until after the decision of the substantive appeal. However, the appellants contended that an unforeseen consequence of the decision on the attestation issue was that they became unable to seize and sell at auction the cars which they had taken as security, causing them substantial financial loss, and they therefore sought permission to appeal at that stage, contrary to the agreed direction, with a view to the appeal being heard and decided as a matter of urgency. The OFT opposed the application. An Upper Tribunal judge directed a rolled up hearing of the permission application and the appeal, which was heard by a three-judge panel. 
Held, unanimously giving permission and, by a majority, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	while the appeal direction was plainly an important matter to take into account in deciding how to exercise the Upper Tribunal’s discretion, there were special and unusual features of the case sufficient to render it in the interests of justice to give permission to appeal: the appeal on the point raised a seriously arguable point of law, and the point was material to the substantive case and was a matter of considerable financial importance to the appellants (paragraphs 18 to 24);  
2.	the clear balance of advantage, in the particular circumstances of the case and as the best way of furthering rather than frustrating the overriding objective of getting the substantive proceedings determined justly, expeditiously and with finality, lay in granting permission and determining the appeal on the attestation issue (paragraph 25);  
3.	a company cannot in any meaningful sense witness the execution of a document, as attestation involves the witness being physically present and observing the execution, with a view to subsequently giving evidence as to the execution if necessary. The reasoning in Peace v Brookes (and not merely the outcome) is inconsistent with both a contention that section 10 requires that attestation by a party’s agent be attributed to that party and a contention that section 10 prohibits attestation not only by a party but also by an agent (paragraph 78 to 84);
4.	applying the analysis in Meridian, the question is ultimately one of interpretation or construction of the relevant substantive rule. If a correct interpretation or construction of section 10 of the 1882 Act disclosed a sufficient intention that, for the purposes of the requirement that attestation must not be by a party to the bill of sale, there were circumstances in which attestation by an individual should be attributed to a grantee of the bill of sale which is a company, it would be possible, indeed necessary, to give effect to that intention, even in cases where wrongful conduct by a company is not in issue (paragraphs 85 to 90);
5.	section 10 renders the bill of sale void even as between the original parties to it, thus depriving the grantee of his security, and that is a drastic result, which should not follow unless it were sufficiently clear that it was intended by Parliament: Hill v Kirkwood (1880) 28 WR 358, CA, followed. The notion that an individual’s attestation could be attributed to a company, however closely connected with it that individual may be, is an unnatural and surprising one and not something which one would expect to have been in the contemplation of Parliament unless a clear intention to that effect is displayed (paragraph 92(1) and (2));
6.	the natural and obvious way of achieving the result that a person acting for a corporate party could not validly attest would not have been by way of an (implied) “special rule of attribution” that the individual’s attestation should be attributed to the company, but simply by expressly providing that the attesting witness could not be either a party or a person acting for that party in the transaction, but Parliament, apparently deliberately, did not so provide. If such a prohibition had been considered appropriate in the case of a corporate grantee, it would also have been considered appropriate in the case of an individual grantee or a partnership, but  Peace v Brookes is clear, binding and soundly reasoned authority that there is no such prohibition (paragraph 92(5));
7.	the provision in section 10 that the attesting witness cannot be a party simply has no application to companies and there was no reason to conclude that Parliament cannot have intended that result, as even a requirement for attestation by an entirely independent witness would provide only limited protection to a grantor (paragraph 92(6));
8.	(per Judge Levenson, dissenting) a wide variety of acts by those acting for a company can be attributed to a company, and there was no reason why, in the context of witnessing commercial documents, such acts could not include this type of attestation. That would not prevent the natural person who witnessed the bill of behalf of the company from giving evidence that he or she had done so, and it is simply irrelevant what one natural person can or cannot do on behalf of a another natural person, because a company is not a natural person. The decision in Peace was not binding in the present case, as the issue of attribution did not arise in that case (paragraphs 96 to 97).

Disability living allowance – non-payability while in publicly funded residential care – retrospective self-funding – suspension and supersession 
On 1 July 1998 the claimant was awarded the highest rate of the care component and the lower rate of the mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) for an indefinite period. Regulations 8 and 9 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 make provision for disqualifying claimants from payment of DLA, though not from entitlement, where they are resident in hospitals or care homes, the general rule being that neither component of DLA is payable after a stay of more than 28 days in hospital, but that only the care component stops being payable after 28 days in a care home. In January 2000 the claimant went into hospital and in February payments of DLA were “de-combined” from his retirement pension. However, the claim was not transferred to the DLA Unit and payment of DLA ceased without a formal decision on payability being made. The claimant moved to a care home but the DWP remained unaware of that until 2006 and no further decision was made until a supersession decision on 22 November 2006 that the care component was not payable from June 2000. The claimant continued to live in a care home with the bulk of the fees being met by the local authority. The claimant was divorced in October 2000 and so the nature of his beneficial interest in the matrimonial home changed with potential effect on his funding assessment, but the local authority were not made aware of that change until April 2007, when the claimant’s family informed the local authority that his wife had died. The authority then undertook a new assessment and the family reimbursed the fees for the period from 5 October 2000 to 21 July 2007, although that may not have been all legally due. As a result the claimant fell within the exemption from disqualification in regulation 10(8) for claimants who are self-funding. Until 5 October 2003 that exception did not apply to claimants in receipt of income support, as was the claimant in this case from 9 August 2000. The regulation 10(8) exemption was held in Chief Adjudication Officer v Creighton and Others, reported as R1/00(AA) and followed in R(A) 1/02, to apply where care costs were refunded retrospectively. In 2007 the DLA Unit sent the claimant arrears of the lower rate of the mobility component of DLA for the previous seven years, but decided that the care component was not payable before June 2007 because there had been no formal agreement with the local authority that, following the sale of the property, he would repay all the costs and therefore he could be regarded as self-funding only once he had actually repaid the money to the local authority and was paying his own fees. The claimant’s appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal and the Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State conceded that on the authority of R(A) 1/02 it did not matter whether reimbursement of fees had been agreed in advance and the arguments focused on the mechanisms for putting into operation the principles of Creighton and particularly the application of the rules governing time limits for revisions and supersessions under the regime established by the Social Security Act 1998. Under the version of regulation 7(2)(c) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 in force, until it was amended with effect from 9 April 2006, a supersession decision taken on the grounds that the claimant had been a hospital in-patient or a care home resident could only take effect from the date on which it was made.
Held, allowing the appeal, but substituting a decision to similar effect, that:
1.	there were errors in the First-tier Tribunal’s decision, which taken together suggest that it did not adequately address the issues relating to payability of DLA at the various dates and so the decision should be set aside (paragraphs 28 to 30);
1.	Creighton and R(A) 1/02 require that an acceptable technical means be found to allow claimants in circumstances like those of the present case to be paid AA and DLA for a past “bridging’ period” once reimbursement is made to a local authority. In appropriate cases that will involve consideration of the option of suspension of payment of benefit as an alternative to supersession. The DLA authorities should routinely seek detailed information on all capital resources from a claimant or representative when payability is put in question by the claimant’s residence in a care home and consider whether a supersession would be premature and therefore either in error of law or subject to further supersession in favour of the claimant that could not be made retrospective (paragraphs 57, 63 to 72);
2.	if a local authority’s financial assessment under section 22 or 26 of the National Assistance Act 1948 is wrong in law or was based on some mistake or ignorance of fact, the challenge has to be made to the assessment itself. Unless and until such a challenge is successful the statutory liability created by the financial assessment must be accepted. In the great majority of cases, where it was the local authority’s initial financial assessment in issue, there would have been something in the circumstances at the time to make a decision that DLA was not payable premature (paragraphs 73 to 77);
3.	until 10 April 2006 the claimant in the present case had an accrued right of a kind within the scope of section 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978 to payability of the DLA to which he was entitled and the retrospective removal of the immunity from supersession by the 2006 Regulations was sufficiently unfair as to give rise to a need for a particular degree of clarity in those Regulations that that effect was intended (Plewa v Chief Adjudication Officer [1995] 1 AC 249, R(P) 2/95 applied). The 2006 Regulations were not sufficiently clear to show that intention and the amendments to regulation 7(2) of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations must be interpreted as applying only in respect of days falling on or after 10 April 2006, although the provision can apply to changes of circumstances that occurred before that date (paragraphs 91 to 125);
5.	the decision of 1 July 1998 should not have been superseded on 22 November 2006 since (a) for the relevant periods up to 5 October 2003, supersession on the ground of a relevant change of circumstances would have been appropriate as the claimant was in receipt of income support, but the superseding decision could not take effect prior to 6 April 2006; (b) in relation to the period from 6 October 2003 onwards, supersession was not appropriate and instead the Secretary of State should have suspended payment of the care component (paragraph 137). 
The Upper Tribunal substituted a decision in relation to the whole period in question leaving intact the awarding decision of 1 July 1998 with the associated right for the claimant to receive payment under the award.

Housing benefit – liability for housing costs – treated as not liable to former partner – whether applies only where liability arises immediately after separation
The claimant was separated from her former husband and living in the matrimonial home. Some 14 years after they separated, she sold her share of the home to her former husband, and claimed housing benefit for rent payable to him. The local authority decided that she was not entitled to housing benefit on the ground that she fell within one or more of the categories in regulation 9(1) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 of persons to be treated as not liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling. The First-tier Tribunal held that she was caught by regulation 9(1)(c), which provides that a person shall be treated as not liable where his liability is to a former partner and is in respect of a dwelling which he and his former partner occupied before they ceased to be partners. That provision is not subject to the exception in regulation 9(3) and therefore can apply to genuine claimants who have no intention of taking advantage of the housing benefit scheme. The First-tier Tribunal stated that it did not matter whether or not there had been other former partners during the relevant period. It also rejected an argument that regulation 9(1)(c) was inconsistent with Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. Before the Upper Tribunal it was argued that regulation 9(1)(c) applied only to an immediate former partner, and that that required the liability to have arisen immediately on their ceasing to be partners. Also, and in addition to the human rights argument, it was submitted that the amending regulations that inserted the predecessor of regulation 9(1)(c) into the 1987 Regulations in January 1999 were invalid on the ground of a defect in the procedure by which the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) agreed not to have the proposal for the amending regulations referred to it under section 172(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and also because the preamble to the amending regulations stated wrongly that there had been a reference to the SSAC. It was conceded on behalf of the Secretary of State that entitlement to housing benefit was a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights, so that Article 14 on discrimination could be engaged in relation to the conditions of entitlement to housing benefit.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	regulation 9(1) was designed to identify cases in which there was a risk of abuse of the housing benefit scheme, and as the categories may be drawn in a way that could produce rough justice, the narrowest interpretation consistent with the policy of protecting the scheme was required. To interpret regulation 9(1)(c) as applying only to the immediate former partner or the most recent former partner would be going beyond merely adopting the narrowest appropriate ordinary meaning into applying an artificially narrow meaning (paragraphs 15 to 23);
2.	it was evident from the relevant documentation that the SSAC had subjected the whole of the draft regulations to close analysis and had not been misled as to the specific effect of what became regulation 9(1)(c), and, whichever interpretation was adopted, the amending regulation introducing what became regulation 9(1)(c) was validly made (paragraphs 30 to 31);
3.	 in the absence of a report from the SSAC, the mistake in the preamble to the draft regulations could not have misled Parliament in any material respect in any way that could affect the validity of the amending regulations (paragraphs 33 to 36);
4.	on the issue of discrimination, while the existence of some alternative response with a narrower scope could be a relevant factor in judging whether any difference of treatment was justified, that must always be subject to a judgment about how far the proposed alternative does the job of meeting the legitimate aim in question. There would be obvious practical difficulties and opportunities for avoidance in the suggested alternative of interpreting regulation 9(1)(c) as applying only where the liability arose immediately on separation of the partners and so a difference of treatment of the kind alleged in the present case was justified as a proportionate response to a legitimate aim and did not amount to discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention (paragraphs 37 to 42).

Safeguarding vulnerable groups – children’s barred list – standard of proof – fair hearing
The appellant was subject to investigations by the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) in 2008 in relation to allegations of sexual abuse of boys in 1977–81 and 1985–89 and of possessing sexual images of boys. As none of the incidents had led to a conviction, he was considered for inclusion on the barred lists on a discretionary basis, subject to the consideration of representations, as provided by paragraph 3(1)–(3) of Schedule 3 to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). The ISA case worker completed the initial assessment and information stages of investigation, as advised in ISA’s Guidance Notes for the Barring Decision Making Process and concluded that “relevant conduct” had occurred and that it would not be appropriate for the appellant to continue to work with children. Following detailed representations from the appellant’s solicitors, the case worker undertook the fourth and fifth stages of the decision-making process and concluded that the appellant should be barred from working with children by being placed on the Children’s Barred List. However, in accordance with the ISA’s Guidance Notes, she also referred the case to the ISA Board for a final decision. The Board reviewed both the evidence provided and the appellant’s representations and decided to recommend that he be included on the children’s barred list. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal, arguing that (1) ISA had misapplied the burden of proof; (2) ISA had misapplied the proper statutory test under paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to the 2006 Act; (3) ISA had erred in law by failing to offer the appellant an oral hearing, a failure which could not be cured by the right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal; and (4) ISA’s decision was perverse.
Held, dismissing the appeal, but making recommendations to ISA for improvements in procedure and practice, that:
1.	it was clear from the minutes of the board’s meeting that it had not misapplied the burden of proof, though the decision letter had been extremely poorly drafted, wrongly suggesting that the burden of proof was on the appellant, and ISA should take steps to ensure that such a letter was never sent out again (paragraphs 37 to 40);
2.	the appellant’s right of appeal was confined by section 4(2) of the 2006 Act to any point of law in ISA’s decision or any finding of fact which it had made and on which the decision was based. However, in this new hybrid form of appellate jurisdiction the Upper Tribunal was not limited by the constraints set by R (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 as those comments were made in the context of a second appeal limited to points of law only, and so if the appellant could point to any finding of fact on which ISA’s decision was based as being plainly wrong, that might form the basis for a successful appeal (paragraphs 52 to 53);
3.	   ISA had applied the correct standard of proof, that is the balance of probabilities, and, in the light of all the factors, including the facts admitted by the appellant and the striking similarity between the two sets of allegations that could not be explained away on the basis of coincidence, collaboration, collusion or cross-contamination, had neither erred in law nor made any material mistakes of fact in concluding that the appellant had engaged in relevant conduct. While there were aspects of its consideration of the case that might have been improved, its conclusions as to the facts of both principal allegations by the complainants were justified on the evidence: Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families v J [2009] EWHC 524 (Admin) applied (paragraphs 54 to 83);
4.	    there was then a separate issue as to the finding of appropriateness to bar. In this case there was no serious argument that, if the findings of fact were made out, ISA could reach any decision other than that the appellant was unsuitable to work with children, and so it was not necessary to explore the respective remit and expertise of ISA and that of the Upper Tribunal, bearing in mind the enigmatic language of section 4(3) of the 2006 Act, as discussed in R (on the application of Royal College of Nursing & Ors) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2010] EWHC 2761 (Admin)  (paragraphs 18 to 19 and 84);
5.	    while there was no doubt that, as a matter of principle, Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair hearing) applied to proceedings before ISA in that those proceedings involved the determination of the appellant’s civil rights and obligations, the appellant had no absolute right to an oral hearing before ISA reached its decision nor on the facts of this case did ISA err in law by failing to offer him such a hearing: Royal College of Nursing and R (on the application of G) v The Governors of X School [2011] UKSC 30 considered. However ISA should consider and ideally set out in a publicly available document the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to hold an oral hearing (paragraphs 95 to 108, 116);
6.	   given that the other grounds of appeal were rejected by the Upper Tribunal, the perversity challenge inevitably fell away (paragraphs 111 and 112).

Industrial disease – prescribed disease A14 (osteoarthritis of the knee in coal miners) –replacement of affected knee by artificial joint 
Osteoarthritis of the knee was prescribed as industrial disease A14 in respect of certain categories of coal-miner with effect from 13 July 2009. The claimants in the two appeals both made claims shortly after that date for industrial injuries disablement benefit in respect of loss of faculty resulting from that disease. Both had had operations replacing all or part of their knee joints with artificial joints some considerable time after contracting the disease but before the disease was prescribed. In both cases the decision-maker assessed disablement from 13 July 2009 on the basis that the claimants had the prescribed disease at that date. Both claimants appealed against their assessments and in both cases the First-tier Tribunal took the view that it was not possible to have osteoarthritis in an artificial joint. As a result the tribunal in the case of total replacement decided that the claimant did not have the disease and the tribunal in the case of partial replacement decided that loss of faculty in the unreplaced part of the knee only was to be considered. Both claimants appealed to the Upper Tribunal. It was common ground at that stage that the First-tier Tribunal’s approach had been wrong in law. The Upper Tribunal judge received medical evidence that there is usually some residual lower limb impairment following knee replacement surgery.
Held, allowing the appeals, that:
1.	applying section 103 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act, the question to be determined was whether the claimant suffered from loss of physical or mental faculty and then whether that loss of faculty was as the result of the relevant disease. Therefore both tribunals had gone wrong in looking for a current medical diagnosis of osteoarthritis at the date of decision, rather than focusing on the loss of faculty and then asking what had caused it (paragraphs 15 to 17);
2.	subject to the evidence in any particular case, it would not in general be appropriate to regard knee replacement operations which go ahead without complications as breaking the chain of causation between the original osteoarthritis and such loss of faculty as a claimant may continue to experience. In the present cases there was no evidence on which a tribunal could properly conclude that the chain of causation was broken (paragraphs 18 and 19);
3.	it was at the stage of assessment of the degree of disablement that any improvement in lower limb function resulting from replacement of the knee joint fell to be taken into account and the possibility of an assessment of disablement above 0 per cent was not excluded merely because a claimant’s knees had been replaced; rather, the matter fell to be considered on a case-by-case basis (paragraph 21);
4.	in both the present cases there was sufficient doubt about the basis for the First-tier Tribunal’s assessments for the cases to be remitted to a differently constituted tribunal for rehearing (paragraphs 24 to 26).

Employment and support allowance – linked claim – whether assessment necessary for award of work-related activity component 
The claimant was in receipt of income-related employment and support allowance (ESA), and following a work capability assessment was awarded the work-related activity component (WRAC), but did not qualify for the support component. That entitlement came to an end when he started full-time employment on 16 March 2010. The employment ended on 24 March 2010 and he made a new claim for ESA with effect from 25 March 2010 and provided medical evidence from that date. He was awarded ESA from that date on the basis of regulation 145(1) and (2) of the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (the ESA Regulations), which provides that any period of limited capability for work which is separated from another such period by not more than 12 weeks is to be treated as a continuation of the earlier period. However, in accordance with departmental guidance and advice, he was awarded the rate not including the WRAC because, having started a new “assessment phase”, he did not meet the condition for the WRAC in section 4(5)(a) of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 that the assessment phase has ended and was unable to qualify until he had had another work capability assessment. The claimant appealed. The First-tier Tribunal decided that, contrary to the Secretary of State’s view, regulation 149 of the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 had the effect that qualification for the WRAC resumed on the first day of the new period of ESA entitlement and that the claimant qualified for the WRAC from and including 25 March 2010. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the provisions of regulations 148 to 150 were rendered irrelevant in the circumstances of the present case by regulation 7(1)(b) of the ESA Regulations, which applied precisely to the circumstances of the present case and provides that, where a period of limited capability for work is to be treated as a continuation of an earlier period of limited capability for work under regulation 145(1) or (2), section 4(5)(a) of  the Act does not apply. The effect of  regulation 7(1)(b) in the present case was that as from 25 March 2010 the claimant qualified for the WRAC if the conditions in section 4(5)(b) and (c) were met, without any need to consider the assessment phase condition in section 4(5)(a) (paragraphs 11 and 12);
2.	the claimant satisfied section 4(5)(b) on its correct construction. That sub-paragraph sets out the condition that the claimant does not have limited capability for work-related activity and the natural and obvious meaning of the words of section 4(4)(b) and 4(5)(b) is that together the two provisions exhaust all possibilities in relation to limited capability for work-related activity. Providing that paragraph (a) on the ending of the assessment phase is satisfied or does not apply, either a claimant has limited capability for work-related activity, in which case section 4(4)(b) applies, or has not, in which case section 4(5)(b) applies, and considering the provisions in context made no difference of substance (paragraphs 15 and 16);
3.	the tribunal came to the only possible legal conclusion on the facts, although not by reference to the correct legal basis. The claimant qualified for the WRAC from 25 March 2010 under section 4(5) of the 2007 Act because paragraph (a) was not applicable, he satisfied paragraph (b) and there were no other conditions prescribed under paragraph (c) (paragraph 18).

Mental health – relationship between Mental Health Act and Mental Capacity Act
The appellant had been a patient detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) for some years. He made an application to the First-tier Tribunal, in which his representative argued that he should be discharged but that, because he lacked the capacity to make decisions in respect of his residence and consumption of alcohol, his discharge should be deferred for a deprivation of liberty procedure to be put in place under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA), by which he would be accompanied at all times in order to prevent him buying or acquiring alcohol. That would have the effect that detention under the MHA was no longer appropriate or necessary, as it would provide an alternative means of protecting his safety and that of others from the consequences of his alcohol consumption. The tribunal decided that his detention should continue and when considering alternative arrangements did not mention the MCA. The patient appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The Secretary of State had issued a Code of Practice under section 118 of the MHA, which set out a number of guiding principles, including the “least restriction principle”, requiring that people taking action without a patient’s consent must attempt to keep to a minimum the restrictions they impose on the patient’s liberty, having regard to the purpose for which the restrictions are imposed, and the principle that it was important to seek alternatives to detention, which may include procedures under the MCA, even where they deprive patients of their liberty. However, the MCA itself contains measures setting out specific circumstances in which the fact that someone is, or could be made, subject to compulsory measures under the MHA means that they cannot also be deprived of their liberty under the MCA. Those circumstances are set out in the “eligibility requirement” in paragraph 17 of Schedule A1 to the MCA, the meaning of which is defined by Schedule 1A to that Act. A person who is ineligible in accordance with Schedule 1A cannot be deprived of their liberty under the MCA. In J v the Foundation Trust [2009] EWHC 2972 (Fam); [2010] Fam 70, it was stated that the MHA is to have primacy when it applies, and that the medical practitioners referred to in sections 2 and 3 of the MHA cannot pick and choose between the two statutory regimes as they think fit having regard to general considerations. The Upper Tribunal judge considered the scope of that case and the relationship between the two statutory regimes.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the least restriction principle and its numerous applications in the Code of Practice are inherent both in the stringent conditions that must be satisfied for continuing detention pursuant to the MHA and in a patient’s rights under Articles 5 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights to liberty and respect for home and family life. However, the Code itself, being merely guidance on the application of the MHA, is not relevant to the interpretation of the MCA (paragraph 10);
2.	the judge in J was concerned with a challenge to a standard authorisation under the MCA of a deprivation of liberty and his analysis made sense in that context where there would be two legislative regimes that might apply without any express provision for giving one priority over the other. In other contexts, it would not be possible to say which Act had priority without reference to the circumstances of the particular case (paragraph 20);
3.	in the present case, there was no reason why the MCA could not be applied in anticipation of the patient moving to a care home as paragraph 12(3) of Schedule A1 to the MCA allows, and even if the proposed arrangements under the MCA would amount to a deprivation of liberty, once the patient was discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act he would no longer be within the scope of the MHA as defined by paragraph 12(1) of schedule 1A and therefore would not be ineligible for a deprivation of liberty procedure under the MCA (paragraphs 22 to 25); 
4.	the tribunal had erred in law in failing to deal with the argument on the Mental Capacity Act (paragraph 26).
The judge remitted the case to the tribunal for rehearing by a differently constituted panel.

Housing benefit – capacity of claimant to enter into a contract of lease – proper approach to determining legal capacity
The claimant applied for housing benefit in respect of the tenancy of a property owned by his mother. His application was rejected because the tenancy was not on a commercial basis. The local authority reconsidered the decision but did not alter it. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, which held that the tenancy was on a commercial basis. That decision was set aside by a district tribunal judge who remitted the matter for a re-hearing by the First-tier Tribunal. At the re-hearing, the First-tier Tribunal again upheld the appeal but on the basis that the claimant lacked capacity to contract and was liable to make payments to his mother under the common law doctrine of recompense. The local authority appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the question arising in this case was the claimant’s legal capacity to enter the contracts of lease material to his application for housing benefit (paragraph 6);
2.	the test for legal incapacity set out in R(IS) 17/94 and paragraph 6 of CSH/5/2009, as followed by the tribunal, was no longer correct in law (paragraph 10);
3.	the proper test for capacity to be applied was the individual claimant’s specific capacity in particular circumstances, for a particular purpose at a particular time. The law was correctly stated by Professor McBryde in paragraph 3-46 in Contract (3rd edition) (paragraph 10);
4.	this test was consistent with the approach set out in the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 (paragraph 10); 
5.	there is a presumption in favour of capacity which can only be overcome by independent and informed evidence. The appointment of an appointee for benefit purposes is not conclusive on an issue of capacity to contract and is only an adminicle of evidence on that question (paragraph 11).

European Union law – whether child tax credit is a supplement to state retirement pension within the meaning of Article 77 of Regulation 1408/71/EEC and therefore exportable to Iceland
The appellant and his wife were in receipt of child tax credit in respect of their children. The appellant was also in receipt of a Category A state retirement pension. They moved permanently to Iceland in February 2009. State retirement pension continued in payment, but Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs stopped payment of tax credit on the grounds that the family were no longer in the United Kingdom and therefore no longer met one of the conditions in section 3(3) of the Tax Credits Act 2002. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal and he appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The dispute in the appeal centred on whether child tax credit in the circumstances of the case was an exportable benefit under Regulation 1408/71 (EEC), as applied to Iceland, one of the three countries of the European Economic Area. In PF and SF v HMRC (TC) [2010] UKUT 49 (AAC) it had been held that child tax credit was not a family allowance within the meaning of Article 77 of Regulation 1408/71/EEC as it was not granted exclusively by reference to the number and ages of the children in question, but was a means-tested benefit. However, the Upper Tribunal judge considered whether in this case child tax credit could be regarded as an increase or supplement to state retirement pension in respect of the pensioner’s children and therefore as exportable under the alternative limb of Article 77.1.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the history of child tax credit showed that it was the direct successor to the increases in retirement pension provided for in section 80 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act, and since the calculation of child tax credit took account of state retirement pension, it constituted in the circumstances of this particular case, an increase or supplement to that pension payable in respect of children of the pensioner. The child tax credit therefore fell within Article 77 and was payable in Iceland (paragraphs 53 to 57);
2.	the tribunal had erred in considering only the first limb of Article 77 and failing to consider the second limb (paragraphs 58 to 59);
3.	while the entering into force from 1 May 2010 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, with its broader definition of “family benefits”, had resolved the issue in relation to the 27 Member States of the European Union, the position of those living in Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway would continue to be governed by Regulation 1408/71 from 1 May 2010 until such time as the provisions of Regulation 883/2004 were extended to those countries (paragraphs 63 to 66).

Children’s barred list – public confidence a material consideration

On 14 July 2009 the respondent pleaded guilty to various offences concerning indecent photographs of children. He received a suspended sentence of imprisonment and, among other things, was subject to a Sexual Offence Prevention Order (SOPO) prohibiting him from seeking or taking paid or voluntary employment with children under 16. The Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) wrote to the respondent to say that his name was included on both the Adults’ Barred List and the Children’s Barred List. He was invited to make representations if he wished to have his name removed. The respondent replied to say that his inclusion on the Lists was disproportionate as he was addressing his behaviour, which he now accepted had been unacceptable, and that the Court’s orders provided a sufficient means of control. The ISA agreed to remove his name from the Adults’ Barred List but not the Children’s Barred List. It subsequently explained the various reasons for its decision including an erroneous reference to the court having imposed a Disqualification from Working with Children Order. The respondent appealed to the Upper Tribunal (UT) on the basis that the erroneous reference to a Disqualification Order was a material mistake of fact and his inclusion on the Children’s Barred List was disproportionate. The UT decided that the reference to a Disqualification Order was not a material error of fact as a SOPO had been issued but rejected the ISA’s submission that consideration of the issues relating to the weight the ISA had attached to individual issues was outside its jurisdiction. It concluded that the ISA had failed to take account of all the available evidence, including that of the Probation Service, or to consider the respondent as a person, including an assessment of his oral evidence. The Upper Tribunal decided that these failures by the F-tT were an error of law and concluded from the available evidence that the respondent was unlikely to reoffend. It directed the ISA to remove the respondent from the Children’s Barred List. The ISA appealed against that decision. The case before the Court of Appeal raised important issues about appeals against decisions of the ISA, including the correct approach to proportionality and the extent to which public confidence in the statutory scheme is a material consideration. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the UT is empowered to determine proportionality and rationality (Wyn Williams J in R (Royal College of Nursing) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWHC 2761 (Admin)) but not to carry out a merits reconsideration, as in this respect its jurisdiction is more limited than the Care Standards Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the previous legislation. The UT failed to accord any particular weight to the decision of the ISA, an independent statutory body charged with the primary decision making tasks as to whether an individual should be listed or not. Instead it proceeded to a de novo consideration of its own. The assessment by the ISA caseworker was careful and fair and took into account various factors including the positive references to the respondent, the fact that the respondent had voluntarily sought counselling, and the material upon which the criminal conviction had been founded and which had informed the sentencing process. The objective facts were not in dispute. The ISA” is particularly equipped to make safeguarding decisions of this kind, whereas the UT is designed not to consider the appropriateness of listing but more to adjudicate upon ‘mistakes’ on points of law or findings of fact” (paragraphs 14 to 22); 
2.	the decision of the UT did not refer to public confidence as a material consideration. While it was not expressly referred to in the legislation, the jurisprudence of the Care Standards Tribunal acknowledged the significance of public confidence. This approach was equally applicable to the decisions of the UT on appeal from the ISA. Public confidence was something which must be placed in the scales when consideration has being given to the personal characteristics and interests of an appellant. It will always be a material consideration (paragraphs 22 to 24).
Editor’s note: the functions of the ISA were taken over by the Disclosure and Barring Service from 1 December 2012.

Practice and procedure – First-tier and Upper Tribunals in England and Wales – whether courts for purpose of vexatious litigant orders – whether, if permission required, Upper Tribunal had power to give permission
The appellant was made a vexatious litigant in 2003 by an order under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. That had the effect that he required permission of the High Court to institute or continue proceedings in any court. In 2010 he lodged appeals against four decisions of the Information Commissioner. A judge of the First-tier Tribunal struck out the appeals for lack of permission, being out of time and having no reasonable prospect of success. Another judge of that tribunal gave permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal held an oral hearing to decide the preliminary issue whether the appellant needed the permission of the High Court to bring those proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal; and, if he did, whether the Upper Tribunal had power to give permission under section 25 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (the 2007 Act). The Information Commissioner relied on Re Terence Patrick Ewing [2002] EWHC 3169 (QB) (Ewing). In that case, which concerned a vexatious litigant, the court held that the Information Tribunal (whose functions were since transferred to the First-tier Tribunal) was a court. It was also noted that employment tribunals had been accepted as inferior courts for that purpose: Attorney General v Douglas (No 2) [2006] EWHC 1982 (Admin) and Ewing v The Security Service [2003] EWCA Civ 581. In Ewing the tribunal had consisted of eminent, senior lawyers who had to apply judicial review criteria to an issue of national security. In the present case, however, the Upper Tribunal had to take account of the full range of the First-tier Tribunal’s functions and not just the information rights jurisdiction (whose judicial review powers had since been repealed), and to apply to that jurisdiction the principle that the law distinguishes between a body exercising a judicial function and one exercising an administrative one: Attorney-General v BBC [1981] AC 303. The Upper Tribunal judge considered in turn the points in the summary in [40] of Ewing and their application to the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal as a whole. 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the establishment and constitution of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal are prescribed by Parliament under the 2007 Act and the Practice Statements of the Senior President and require the presence of at least one legally qualified judicial member: cf [40.1] of Ewing (paragraph 26);
2.	the duty of the tribunal is to decide whether the decision under appeal was in accordance with the law and, on appeal, the issue for the Upper Tribunal is whether that tribunal made an error of law. Powers equivalent to judicial review were a feature in Ewing but are not an essential characteristic of a court. It is not a feature of all the ordinary courts and the employment tribunal has no such powers, although those are all courts for vexatious litigant purposes: cf [40.2]  of Ewing (paragraph 28);
3.	all chambers of both the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal operate under rules that are essentially similar in content and structure, consisting of a common core, and all those rules find equivalents in the rules that apply in the High Court and County Court. In terms of characteristics, the tribunal rules of procedure contain what is to be expected of the rules governing the proceedings before a judicial body: cf [40.3]  of Ewing (paragraph 30);
4.	the general tenor of the analysis and conclusions in the BBC case was consistent with the classification of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal as courts. The proper classification of a body as a court was ultimately a matter of impression, the other matters being merely factors that help to inform the analysis that underlies that impression: cf [40.4] of Ewing. The tribunal in Ewing was very much at one extreme of the spectrum of the range of courts, but a consideration of the wide range of cases that come before the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal both across their chambers and specifically in their information right jurisdiction led to an overall impression that those tribunals were courts for the present purposes (paragraphs 32 to 34);
5.	section 25 of the 2007 Act confers on the Upper Tribunal the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court in relation to specific matters (not applicable in the present case) and “all other matters incidental to the Upper Tribunal’s functions”. That provision cannot override express statutory provisions that confer powers on the High Court. It was inconceivable that, in the context of the numerous amendments to other legislation made by the 2007 Act, that general provision could have the effect of overriding statutory provisions that were expressly limited to the High Court. Furthermore the word “incidental” was suggestive of something subordinate or secondary to the functions of the Upper Tribunal. However, permission for a vexatious litigant was an essential prerequisite to the court or tribunal having jurisdiction in respect of that person especially one going to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, and as such was not appropriately described as incidental (paragraphs 37 to 38);
6.	the First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to deal with any aspect of the appellant’s appeals unless and until he obtained permission of the High Court and the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on a point of law (paragraphs 1 and 46).

European Union law – application of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 to long-term incapacity benefit
The claimant was a Polish citizen. He worked in the United Kingdom (UK) for the period 19 December 2005 to 20 October 2006. He paid national insurance contributions in the tax year 2005–06 for 16 weeks, followed by 28 weeks in the tax year 2006–07. In October 2006 he was taken ill and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. He returned to Poland in November 2006 and in January 2008 made a claim for a Polish invalidity pension, which was rejected because he failed to meet the condition under Polish law of a period of insurance of five years at the date of claim, even when his 11 months of insurance in the UK were taken into account, a decision subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal in Warsaw. On his claim being referred to the UK under EU procedures, the Secretary of State decided that he was not entitled to long-term incapacity benefit under UK legislation because he had completed an insurance period of less than one year, citing Article 48.1 of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, which provides that the institution of a Member State shall not be required to award benefits in respect of periods completed under the legislation it administers which are taken into account when the risk materialises, if the duration of the said periods does not amount to one year. The claimant appealed. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal on the basis that the requisite number of contributions had not been satisfied by the claimant during his period of employment in the UK, without considering or enquiring into his contributions in Poland. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. For the purposes of Regulation 1408/71 there are two types of invalidity benefits: those where the amount of invalidity benefits is independent of the duration of periods of insurance (“Type A”) and those where the amount does depend on such periods (“Type B”). A list of the former appears at Annex IV, part A of the Regulation and includes, at point AA, the legislative provisions applicable to UK invalidity pension, the statutory predecessor to long-term incapacity benefit. The Annex does not refer to invalidity benefit in Poland and the Polish scheme is, therefore, a Type B scheme. 
Held, allowing the appeal but substituting a decision in identical terms, that:
1.	as UK long-term incapacity benefit was a Type A scheme (being dependent on completion of a period on short-term incapacity benefit rather than of periods of insurance) whereas Poland’s was a Type B scheme, Article 40 was applicable, which in turn applies by analogy the rules about retirement pensions in Articles 44–51a (paragraphs 14 to 16);
2.	Article 40(2) created an exception from Article 40(1) where a claimant “suffers incapacity for work leading to invalidity while subject to a legislation listed in Annex IV, part A”, and led to a different set of rules. The more natural reading of the English text was that the expression “suffers incapacity for work leading to invalidity” referred to the onset of the period of incapacity, not of the subsequent invalidity. On that assumption, the claimant’s incapacity commenced when he had his sudden episode of mental illness and therefore while he was subject to UK legislation, but that did not assist him as the indents to Article 40(2) required him to have satisfied the conditions of UK legislation by completing 364 days on short-term incapacity benefit (paragraphs 17 to 21);
3.	Article 40(3) made special provisions for a person who had suffered incapacity for work leading to invalidity not in the Member State whose Type A scheme was being considered, but in “another Member State”, but even if that were taken as referring to the onset of invalidity, it did not assist the claimant as he had not received any benefits in Poland that could be taken into account (paragraphs 23 to 24);
4.	the whole language of Article 48 addressed a period which was brought to completion by virtue of the risk materialising and, whether the date at which the risk materialised in the present case were taken as the date of onset of incapacity in the UK or of invalidity in Poland, the claimant could not escape the operation of Article 48. It would make no difference that it was allegedly because of stress at work that he was unable to complete one year because he was taken ill (paragraphs  29 to 30);

5.	the expression “periods completed” in Article 48 is intended to refer to actual periods completed so that, even if it were the case that the claimant’s earnings had been sufficiently high to enable him to meet the national insurance contributions condition for any given year while in fact working for a lesser period, that would not help him, since the European legislature would express law intended for application across Europe in terms (actual periods) which were capable of being applied anywhere, rather than dependent on the idiosyncrasies of a particular Member State’s system (paragraph 31);

6.	Article 48(3) contained a provision for when both Member States concerned could otherwise rely on Article 48(1), aimed at stopping a claim in those circumstances from falling through the gaps. However, Article 48(3) did not apply in the present case as Poland did not have any obligations to be relieved of by Article 48(1) because the claimant did not satisfy the relevant Polish insurance conditions (paragraph 33);

7.	the First-tier Tribunal had either failed to apply all the relevant provisions necessary before it was in a position to conclude that Article 48 applied or failed to set out sufficiently its reasons as to how those various provisions applied to enable the Upper Tribunal to see whether or not the law had been correctly applied, and had failed to make sufficient findings on key matters, notably what benefits, if any, the claimant had been in receipt of in Poland in the year running up to his claim for long-term incapacity benefit. For those reasons it was in error of law, although its decision was, in the outcome, correct (paragraphs 34 to 35).

European Union law – right to reside – whether claimant was self-employed at date of claim for jobseeker’s allowance for the purposes of Council Directive No. 2004/38/EC 
At the time of his claim, the claimant was a Polish national and a citizen of the European Union. He applied for income-based jobseeker’s allowance. Regulation 85A(4) of the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996 provides, inter alia, that a claimant is not a person from abroad if he is a self-employed person for the purpose of Council Directive No. 2004/38/EC. In 2009, a decision-maker decided that his applicable amount for the purpose of his claim was nil as he was a person from abroad because he did not have a right to reside and was therefore not habitually resident in the UK. The First-tier Tribunal refused his appeal. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was erroneous in law because it had failed to make sufficient findings to determine whether the claimant was self-employed at the time of his claim. Being self-employed and actually working as such were not the same thing. Careful fact-finding on the issue of self-employment was required. (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v JS [2010] UKUT 240 (AAC) and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v AL [2010] UKUT 451 (AAC) followed) (paragraph 9);
2.	Article 7.3(b) and (c) applied only to “workers” and not to “self-employed persons”. The claimant could therefore only succeed in his appeal by establishing that he was self-employed at the date of claim (Tilianu v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2010] EWCA Civ 1397 applied) (paragraph 9);
3.	the decision of the Supreme Court in Patmalniece v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions established that discrimination on the grounds of nationality was justified because the right to reside test had the legitimate purpose of ensuring that a claimant had achieved economic or social integration in the United Kingdom as a pre-condition of entitlement to benefit and that that justification was relevant, sufficient and independent of the issue of nationality. It was noted that the European Commission had indicated that the decision in Patmalniece contravened European Law. However no reference had been made to the European Court of Justice and accordingly the decision of the Supreme Court remained a binding authority (paragraph 12);
4.	the decision of the Court of Appeal in Tilianu v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions established that Article 7.3(b) and (c) applies only to “workers” but not “self-employed persons”. The proposition that this decision should not be followed in Scotland was rejected. Judges of the Upper Tribunal sitting in Scotland should ordinarily expect to follow decisions of the Court of Appeal where the point before them is indistinguishable from the issue before the Court. Furthermore an identical issue had previously been determined by a judge of the Upper Tribunal in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v RK [2009] UKUT 209 (AAC) (paragraph 13);
5.	the judge declined to make a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union (paragraph 16).
The judge remitted the case to a new tribunal for redetermination in accordance with the directions in paragraph 18.

Housing benefit – liability of person without contractual capacity for reasonable cost of accommodation
Upper Tribunal procedure – review under rules 45 and 46 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 where a legislative provision overlooked
The claimant was profoundly disabled from birth and lived in a home specially constructed for her and paid for by her parents by way of a mortgage. She applied for housing benefit on the basis of a tenancy agreement dated 26 February 2009 expressed to be between her father as landlord and herself as tenant. She was unable to sign the agreement as she was unable to communicate at all and the local authority refused the claim. In February 2010 an order was made in the Court of Protection giving her mother power to act in certain respects on her behalf. The First-tier Tribunal held, following CH/2121/2006, that she was bound in common law by the terms and conditions of the contract which was voidable and not void and that she was liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling which she occupied as her home. On the local authority’s appeal, the judge of the Upper Tribunal concluded that she had no liability to pay rent on the basis of a document to which she was not a party and of which she had no knowledge or means of knowledge and that there was no other basis on which any liability for rent could be imposed on her prior to the date of the decision. The claimant appealed on the grounds that the judge was wrong in deciding that there was no contract and also that he had failed to consider her liability to pay a reasonable sum in respect of her occupation of the property by virtue of the provisions of section 7 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 concerning payment for necessary goods and services. As a legislative provision had been overlooked in the making of the decision, the judge reviewed his decision under rule 45(1)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in accordance with rule 46. 
Held, reviewing the earlier UTAAC decision, setting it aside and re-deciding the matter, that:
1.	although the claimant had no contractual liability to pay rent, the accommodation was a necessary and either at common law or under section 7 she was liable to pay a reasonable sum in respect of the accommodation. That liability was a liability with section 130(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 in respect of which she was entitled to housing benefit (paragraphs 27 to 29);
2.	the First-tier Tribunal judge was in error of law in basing his decision on contract and his decision was therefore set aside and a new decision substituted to the effect that the claimant was under an obligation to her parents to pay a reasonable sum for her accommodation equal to the rent provided for in the putative tenancy agreement (paragraph 32).
The matter was remitted to the local authority to calculate the claimant’s entitlement to benefit accordingly.

Residence and presence conditions – exportability of disability living allowance to EU
European Union Law – Regulation (EC) 1408/71– whether disability living allowance mobility component is a special non-contributory benefit which is not exportable
Following the Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in Case C-537/09 Bartlett v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, as reported in [2012] AACR 34, the mobility component of the disability living allowance (DLA) is non-exportable being a special non-contributory benefit. However, the claimant’s representatives asked the Upper Tribunal to refer further questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) arguing that: the Court’s reasons for the severability of the mobility component from the rest of the DLA and its treatment as a benefit within Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 were inadequate; to apply the ruling in an United Kingdom tribunal would violate the claimant’s fundamental rights under European Union law to an effective remedy and a fair trial; and the correctness of the ruling was questionable given the ruling of the Fifth Chamber on 5 May 2011 in Case C-206/10 European Commission v Federal Republic of Germany. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the ECJ set out the relevant general principles in Case 69/85 Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft GmbH v Federal Republic of Germany [1986] ECR 947. It held that a judgment in which it give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation or validity of an act of a Community institution conclusively determines a question of Community law and is binding on the national court. The national court may make a further reference to the ECJ if it cannot understand or apply the judgment, or there is a fresh question of law, or when it submits new considerations which might lead to give a different answer. But the right to refer further questions cannot be used as a means of contesting the validity of the original judgment. In this case the ECJ’s ruling was both clear and unambiguous and contained nothing which would entail any breach of fundamental rights. Therefore there was no legal basis for referring further questions to the ECJ and the ruling had to be applied by the United Kingdom judicial authorities (paragraphs 6 to 9);

2.	the case of Case C-466/00 Kaba v Secretary of State for the Home Office [2003] ECR I-2219 does not affect the fundamental principle that the national referring court cannot challenge the validity of the ruling given by the ECJ (paragraphs 11 to 13). The issuing of the ruling in the case of the Commission v Germany does not constitute a new consideration justifying the reference of the same, or further, questions to the ECJ (paragraphs 14 to 15);

3.	the discussion in Case C-503/09 Stewart v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (21 July 2011) concerned the presence conditions of entitlement for incapacity benefit in youth for which Regulation No 1408/71 provided no co-ordination rule. The position is different where Regulation No 1408/71 does provide a co-ordination rule. The judgment in Stewart therefore throws no doubt on the ECJ’s conclusion nor provides any justification for reference of further questions or of the same questions again (paragraphs 17 to 21).

Jobseeker’s allowance – misconduct – whether sanction was appropriate under the public interest disclosure legislation 
The claimant was employed by Birmingham City Council as a school business manager in July 2008. In April 2009 he made enquiries of the Head Teacher about alleged discrepancies in her travel expenses claim. He failed to resolve his concerns and in May sent an email to a Principal Employee Relations Officer of the Council which he also copied to the Chair of Governors and several officers within the school who reported to him. On 11 May the claimant was suspended from work and in December he was dismissed on the ground of gross misconduct. He then claimed jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) but was disqualified from receiving benefit for 12 weeks from 11 May 2010 to 27 July 2010 as he had lost his employment through misconduct. He appealed on the grounds that his dismissal was wrong, as his disclosures were protected under the public interest legislation, and that he had submitted claims to an employment tribunal. The First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) took the view that the claimant had acted correctly in raising his concerns with the Principal Employee Relations Officer but his decision to copy it to junior officers within the school was wrong as it called into question the Head Teacher’s integrity and undermined her relationship with her staff. The F-tT disallowed the appeal and confirmed that the 12-week disqualification was reasonable. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal (UT). The issue before the UT was whether there were any errors of law by the F-tT: (1) in failing to consider or even mention the public interest disclosure legislation; (2) in failing to consider whether to adjourn the hearing pending the employment tribunal’s decision; and (3) in failing to consider whether the council should have established whether or not the claimant’s allegations were correct before dismissing him. 

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:

1.	in certain situations the public interest disclosure legislation establishes, as a matter of public policy, an area of action by an employee as legitimate which may otherwise have led an employer to take disciplinary action. It alters the relationship of employer and employee and the rights and duties of both including what would normally be regarded as blameworthy, reprehensible and wrong under the principles in R(U) 2/77. It would be hard to justify any decision that a person had lost his employment through misconduct where the misconduct consisted only of protected disclosures (paragraph 14);

2.	the F-tT erred in law by failing to address the relevance of the public interest disclosure legislation. But its decision would have been the same even if it had done so, for various reasons. First, it could not have possibly decided the claimant’s disclosures were reasonable as it had already decided it was wrong for him to have copied his email to junior staff. Next, it did not ignore relevant factors or take irrelevant factors into account and its evaluation of the evidence, including the claimant’s explanation, was brief but adequate. None of the three alternative necessary conditions for disclosure to be protected under section 43G(1)(d) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 was satisfied. So there was no material error of law by the F-tT which could have led to a different outcome and so no justification for setting aside its decision (paragraphs 15 to 18);

3.	the F-tT was entitled to decide the case without waiting for the employment tribunal’s decision and to do so without giving reasons. An adjournment would have involved an unknown delay and the claimant had not specifically asked the F-tT to adjourn. The tribunal could have mentioned the employment tribunal proceedings in its statement of reasons but its failure to do so was not an error of law (paragraphs 19 to 20);

4.	under the public interest disclosure legislation it is not a condition of protection that the information disclosed should be accurate or that a criminal offence had actually been committed or a legal obligation not complied with. All that is generally required is a reasonable belief on the part of the person making the disclosure. So there was no need for the F-tT to establish the accuracy of the claimant’s disclosure before deciding his case and its decision that what the claimant did was misconduct was a reasonable judgment for the tribunal to reach (paragraphs 21 to 25).

Environmental information – exceptions – proper approach to information protected by legal professional privilege

In April 2009 Fring Wind Energy Ltd applied for planning permission to erect an anemometer mast to see whether or not a wind farm might be viable. The local planning authority (LPA) refused planning permission and Fring Wind Energy Ltd appealed to the Planning Inspectorate (PINS), an executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Mr Robinson, the second respondent, represented a local residents’ association which opposed the application. He asked PINS to determine the appeal by way of a public inquiry. PINS decided to do so by written representations and explained to Mr Robinson why it thought a public enquiry was unnecessary. An exchange of correspondence took place between PINS and Mr Robinson during the course of which PINS obtained legal advice about the appeal procedure. On 10 December 2009 Mr Robinson asked PINs for a copy of its legal advice under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). As it involved a planning appeal PINS considered the request under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR). It refused Mr Robinson’s request under Regulation 12(5)(b) on the grounds that the advice was protected by legal professional privilege (LPP). Mr Robinson complained to the Information Commissioner (IC) who decided the information need not be disclosed. The First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) upheld Mr Robinson’s appeal on the basis that the balance of public interest favoured disclosure. The DCLG appealed to the Upper Tribunal (UT). The UT held an oral hearing on 16 March 2012 and the issue before it concerned what significance should properly be attached to the branch of LPP known as legal advice privilege: (1) in determining whether the qualified exception from disclosure in regulation 12(5)(b) applied, and if so (2) in weighing the competing public interests for and against maintaining the exception. 

Held, allowing the appeal and re-making the F-tT’s decision, that:

1.	section 42 of the 2000 Act contains a specific qualified exemption in respect of information which in court proceedings would be protected from disclosure by LPP. The 2004 Regulations do not contain an express exception for environmental information which would be subject to LPP but Regulation 12(5)(b) contains a qualified exception to the extent that disclosure of the requested info “would adversely affect the course of justice”. Having regard to the rationale for LPP this would include such loss of confidence in the general efficacy of LPP as would be likely to result from a direction to disclose particular privileged information (paragraphs 42 to 48); 

2.	the approach adopted by the F-tTs, under section 42 of FOIA, to the public interest balancing exercise is broadly appropriate under Regulation 12(5)(b) where the information sought is “environmental information” protected by LPP: in determining whether in a particular case a direction to disclose would adversely affect the course of justice the general loss of confidence in the efficacy of LPP will normally be a factor which will weigh heavily on the side of maintaining the exception (paragraphs 50 to 55);

3.	the F-tT made several errors of law in its approach to the question of whether or not the exception in regulation 12(5)(b) applied: (1) it failed to make it sufficiently clear whether it found the exemption was or was not engaged; (2) it was wrong if it was saying the LPP did not apply to the document concerned; (3) it failed to make it clear whether it had taken into account the general effect on the course of justice which a direction to disclose would have in terms of undermining LPP and to recognise the strong public interest in maintaining their confidentiality (paragraphs 56 to 59);

4.	although the making of findings of fact in an information rights case is an exercise to which the composition of an F-tT, with its lay members with its particular experiences of such issues, is particularly suited, it was appropriate in the present case for the UT to re-make the F-tT’s decision (paragraphs 64);   

5.	in the present case the public interest in maintaining the exception strongly outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information. The factors in favour of disclosure were, in the particular circumstances, relatively weak, and if disclosure were to be directed in this case the loss of confidence in the efficacy of LPP in respect of environmental information would necessarily be considerable. The presumption in favour of disclosure was therefore rebutted (paragraphs 64 to 74).

Procedure – Pensions Appeal Tribunals – whether and when a tribunal can change its mind after giving an oral decision 

War disablement pension – meaning of “officer of the Secretary of State” in Service Pensions Order 2006, Schedule 3, paragraph 10

In October 1981 the claimant, who was serving in the Royal Navy, seriously injured his left leg in a road accident. He was granted premature voluntary release and discharged from the Royal Navy in December 1985. On 21 August 2006 he made a claim for war disablement pension. A decision was made accepting that the condition of his left leg was attributable to service and giving an assessment of 20 per cent with a commencement date of the award of 21 August 2006. The claimant appealed, inter alia on the ground that his award should have been backdated to the date of his discharge in 1985. The relevant provisions of the Naval, Military and Air Force Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 (the 2006 Order) require a claim to be made as a pre-condition of an award (article 34) except where the claimant has been discharged from service on medical grounds (article 35). Where a claim is not necessary an award takes effect from the day after the date of discharge (Schedule 3, paragraph 1(10)), otherwise it takes effect from the date of claim if later than the date of discharge (Schedule 3, paragraph 1). There is an exception: “Where a claimant satisfies the Secretary of State that he would have made a claim on an earlier date … but for an act or omission of the Secretary of State or any officer of his carrying out functions in connection with war pensions … which wrongly caused him to delay the claim … and that act or omission was the dominant cause of the delay, and … continued to be the dominant cause of the delay up to the moment the claim was made.” (Schedule 3, paragraph 10.) On 18 October 2007 a Pensions Appeal Tribunal gave an oral decision that the claimant’s appeal on backdating was disallowed. The following morning, 19 October, the tribunal had a change of mind and gave a short-form written decision, followed later by a written statement of reasons, deciding that backdating should be allowed from the date of the claimant’s discharge in 1985. The claimant had given evidence that he had been advised by a Chief Petty Officer not to take medical discharge as he would be labelled “disabled” and it would make subsequent employment difficult. In giving reasons for its amended decision the Pensions Appeal Tribunal found that the claimant regarded this advice, reinforced by a medical report from a Naval Surgeon Captain, as wholly authoritative and accepted it without question. It further found that the actions of the Chief Petty Officer (backed up by the authority of the Surgeon Captain) represented actions of an officer on behalf of the Secretary of State within paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the 2006 Order and that those acts or omissions wrongly caused the claimant to delay his claim and that these matters were, and remained, the dominant cause of the failure to claim. The Secretary of State for Defence appealed with the leave of the President of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:

1.	the rules governing the giving of a decision by a Pensions Appeal Tribunal do not provide for the decision to be announced orally. The tribunal does not make its decision until that decision is recorded in writing and given or sent to the parties: Hanks v Ace High Productions Ltd [1978] ICR 1155, R v Special Adjudicator ex parte Bashir [2002] Imm AR 1 and SK (Sri Lanka) v SSHD EWCA Civ 495 followed (paragraph 9);
2.	the failure by the tribunal to give any explanation of its radical change of position from the oral to the written decision rendered the tribunal decision given on 19 October in error of law (paragraph 12);
3.	the phrase “officer of the Secretary of State” in paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the 2006 Order does not include armed forces officers acting as such (paragraphs 20 and 21).
The Upper Tribunal judge substituted a decision that there were no grounds for backdating the claim to any earlier date than 21 August 2006.

Editor’s note re paragraph 9: rule 31(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Chamber) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2686) provides that a tribunal may give a decision orally at a hearing.

European Union law – right to reside – whether an illegal contract of employment prevents an employee being a worker under Article 7 of Directive 2004/38/EC 
The claimant, a Dutch national, worked in a restaurant for just under 4 months. He was paid cash in hand (with no deductions for tax) and received no pay slips. He had no written contract of employment and was not given a P45 when the restaurant closed. Thereafter, he was awarded jobseeker’s allowance and, following an assault, he claimed employment and support allowance (ESA). The Secretary of State refused the claim for ESA on the ground that the claimant was a person from abroad with no right to reside in the United Kingdom. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) against the decision. It dismissed the appeal on the ground that the claimant’s contract of employment was illegal and so he could not be treated as a worker. The claimant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The issue before the Upper Tribunal was whether or not the claimant had the status of a worker during the period he was working in the restaurant as, if he had, he retained that status while he was looking for work and while he was temporarily unable to work. 
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the F-tT failed to make sufficient findings of fact to justify its conclusion that the claimant’s contract of employment was illegal and the written evidence was insufficient to allow it to make the necessary findings. It was not illegal for an employer to pay an employee free of income tax and national insurance: du Parcq LJ in Miller v Karlinski (1945) 62 TLR 85. It was only illegal if the employer failed to account for the appropriate amounts to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. An employer who performed a contract in a way that defrauded the authorities cannot enforce the contract: Newland v Simons & Willer (Hairdressers) Ltd [1981] ICR 521. The effect on the employee depended on two factors: (i) the employee’s knowledge of how the contract would be performed; and (ii) the nature and extent of the employee’s participation. As to the employee’s knowledge, the test was subjective (not objective). As to participation, the test was whether “there has been sufficient degree of participation by the employee”: Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd [2001] 1 WLR 225 (paragraphs 8 to 14);
2.	even if the claimant’s contract of employment was illegal the F-tT was wrong to decide that that prevented the claimant from being a worker. “Worker” is a European concept defined by European law through the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court has defined worker as an economic status, not a legal one. Work means the performance of services under the direction of another for remuneration: Case-66/85 Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Württemberg [1986] ECR 2121. The services must be in pursuit of an economic activity: Case-53/87 Levin v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1982] ECR 1035. It does not matter that the job is short-term or temporary. It has been held that work for any given period is not essential: Case 39/86 Lair v Universität Hannover [1988] ECR 3161. The test is whether the activity represents the pursuit of an effective and genuine economic activity. The Court’s definition of work involves an essentially factual enquiry. The elements to be established are: (i) services performed (ii) under direction (iii) for payment. The Court has never said that these elements must be found within any legal relationship. Nor has it said that the elements present must be sufficient to constitute such a relationship(paragraphs 15 to 18).
The judge set aside the decision of the F-tT and remitted the case to a differently constituted F-tT for reconsideration in accordance with his directions.

Mental health – extra-statutory recommendation by First-tier Tribunal – whether there is a right to make representations in support of a request for a recommendation

Two patients were each subject to hospital orders and restriction orders under the Mental Health Act 1983. On a reference to the First-tier Tribunal, the first patient did not seek a discharge but instead sought an extra-statutory recommendation that he be granted leave outside the hospital. Before hearing any evidence, the First-tier Tribunal announced that it had decided that it would not consider making such a recommendation and it did not do so. On an application to the First-tier Tribunal by the second patient, the patient did not seek a discharge but sought an extra-statutory recommendation that he be transferred to less restrictive conditions of detention. At the beginning of the hearing, the First-tier Tribunal judge stated that he was very reluctant to give extra-statutory recommendations and expressed the view that they had value only if there were unreasonable obstructions by the Ministry of Justice. No extra-statutory recommendation was made and the request was not mentioned in the statement of reasons. The patients appealed against, and applied in the alternative for judicial review of, the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal. The principal arguments in both cases were that the patients had a legitimate expectation that requests for extra-statutory recommendations would be considered due to a written Parliamentary answer explaining what would happen if such a recommendation were made and that they were entitled to have their requests for such recommendations considered as a matter of procedural fairness.

Held, dismissing the appeals and refusing permission to apply for judicial review, that:
1.	if a refusal to make an extra-statutory recommendation might be challenged at all, it was by way of an appeal rather than by way of judicial review: Khatib Shahidi v Immigration Appeal Tribunal [2001] Imm AR 124 distinguished on this issue (paragraph 16);
2.	the written Parliamentary answer could not rationally be thought to create any expectation that the making of a recommendation would be considered by the First-tier Tribunal in all cases or in any particular case, there could be no right to an opportunity to invite a tribunal to act beyond its powers and, while making a recommendation might confer an advantage, a refusal even to consider making a recommendation did not confer a corresponding disadvantage and therefore the refusals to consider making extra-statutory recommendations in the present cases were not susceptible to challenges on points of law: Khatib-Shahidi followed on this issue (paragraphs 20 to 27).

Freedom of information – qualified exemptions – prejudice to the prevention of crime – social and financial costs
Freedom of information - public interest test – significance of other forms of accountability
Mr V, the second respondent, applied to the Council under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for a list of every void property in the Borough in which a non-individual was listed as either the owner or as having a material interest in it. The Council refused his request, initially on the basis of the exemption in section 43(2) of the 2000 Act but later, on review, on the basis of sections 12(1) and 21(1). The appellant applied to the Commissioner whereupon the Council relied on the basis of the exemption in section 31(1)(a). (It withdrew the previous exemptions.) The Commissioner upheld the Council’s decision and Mr V then exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT). The F-tT upheld the appeal; it decided that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the public interest in maintaining the exemption for information that would be prejudicial to the prevention of crime. The Council applied for permission to appeal. A F-tT Judge refused the Council’s application and amended the F-tT’s decision by removing the words “public” and “Council” under the slip rule: rule 40 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 SI 2009/1976. The Council renewed its application to the UT and permission to appeal was given by a UT judge.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the F-tT misdirected itself on the scope of its enquiry by narrowly focusing on the nature of the criminal damage and its immediate consequences. Its task was to make an assessment of the public interest, including the social and financial consequences of a crime, not just the immediate financial costs. In performing its task the F-tT should take account of both those financial and social costs sufficiently connected to the interests involved to be part of that assessment, including costs arising from crime prevention, evictions, repairs, insurance premiums and the impact on local property values (paragraphs 7 to 12); 
2.	the F-tT must also consider when assessing the public interest whether or not criminal behaviour might change after the information has been disclosed and cannot simply assume it will remain the same; disclosure might change behaviour. The tribunal must assess the likelihood of prejudice to the public interest and cannot limit that assessment by making assumptions one way or the other (paragraphs 13 and 14); 
3.	the F-tT erred in law by misdirecting itself on the significance of other forms of accountability. Its task was to apply section 2(2)(b) of the 2000 Act and take account of the factors relevant to the public interest whether in maintaining the exemption or in favour of disclosure. The tribunal must assess the nature and extent of any other forms of accountability and this can only be done in the context of the particular case (paragraphs 15 to 19); 
4.	previous decisions are of persuasive authority and the tribunal was right to value consistency in decision-making. However paying too close a regard to previous decisions also has its dangers; it can elevate issues of fact into issues of law or principle and, as in this case, it can lead to statements being taken out of their context and given a general significance (paragraphs 20); 
5.	rule 40 (the slip rule) may be used to correct clerical mistakes and accidental slips or omissions but it cannot be used to cover matters which the judge had planned but failed to mention or where the tribunal has since changed its mind (paragraphs 21 to 26). 
The judge set aside the tribunal’s decision and remitted the case to a differently constituted panel for rehearing

War disablement pension – refusal to review – whether right of appeal
A former soldier claimed disablement pension under the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, now replaced by the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006. It was accepted that his back condition was a pre-existing condition which had been aggravated during service. Disablement was assessed at between one to five per cent on an interim long-term basis and a disability gratuity of over £1,700 was awarded in lieu of a pension. Following an application for review of the assessment the claimant was notified in 2000 that it had been made final but not that a medical adviser for the Ministry of Defence had also signed a certificate of limitation. The adviser’s view was that the post-service deterioration was due to post-service factors. In 2009 the claimant sought a further review on the basis that his condition had deteriorated. The Secretary of State decided there were no grounds to review the case as it was impossible for any deterioration to be because of service. The claimant appealed. The Secretary of State applied for the appeal to be struck out on the ground that there was no right of appeal against a refusal to review. The First-tier Tribunal held that there was a right of appeal under section 5(2) of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943. The Secretary of State appealed. The issues before the Upper Tribunal (UT) were whether the Secretary of State was entitled to refuse to review a decision and, if so, whether the claimant had a right of appeal against such a refusal or a decision that there are no grounds for review. In view of the wider importance of these issues a three-judge panel was constituted. The claimant also applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision which was transferred to the UT to be heard with the appeal. 
 Held, dismissing the Secretary of State’s appeal and granting the claimant permission to apply for judicial review, but dismissing his substantive application, that:
1.	(per Judges Rowland and Mesher) the issuing of a medical certificate of limitation has no legal effect - it is only a device for drawing the attention of decision-makers and medical advisers to reasoning that is likely to be conclusive in future determinations (paragraph 34);

2.	(per Judges Rowland and Mesher) where an award has been made under the Service Pensions Order 2006, following an assessment of disablement, an application for review must be treated as both an application for review of the assessment under article 44(1) and an application for review of the award under article 44(2)(c) (paragraph 40);

3.	(per Judges Rowland and Mesher) an application for review under article 44(1) (on “any ground”) should always lead to a review and therefore a decision under article 44(6). The absence of an arguable ground for revision should lead to a decision to maintain the decision or assessment (not a decision that there are no grounds for a review) (paragraph 50);

4.	(per Judges Rowland and Mesher) a decision under article 44(6) to maintain a previous decision, assessment or award is appealable even though that involves a strained construction of section 5(2) of the 1943 Act (paragraphs 58 and 59); 

5.	(per Judges Rowland and Mesher) alternatively and additionally, a refusal to review is also appealable; a claimant not only has a right of appeal against a decision under article 44(6) to maintain a final assessment, but also has a right of appeal against a decision that there are no grounds for review of such a final assessment, so that any decision under article 44 is appealable (paragraphs 75 and 76);

6.	(per Mr Justice Walker) whether there is a right of appeal under section 5(2) depends on whether the substance of the decision meets the requirements of that section (paragraph130);

7.	(per Mr Justice Walker) those requirements may be met by what is done when deciding not to review an earlier assessment and will be met where the application is considered under article 44(1) under the Secretary of State’s current policy (paragraph 131).

Prescribed disease A14 (osteoarthritis of the knee) – coal miners – definition of osteoarthritis of the knee – whether includes kneecap
The appellant was a 62-year-old man who worked as a coal miner between 1974 and 1986. On 15 October 2009 he claimed industrial disablement benefit for prescribed disease (PD) A14 (osteoarthritis of the knee). He said on his claim form that he had started having problems with his knees in 1980. On 19 May 2010 a doctor examined the appellant on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and diagnosed PD A14 but recorded the loss of faculty from 1 January 1995 (not 1980). On 28 July 2010 a DWP decision-maker assessed the resulting disablement at two per cent, on the basis of the doctor’s report, and so no benefit was payable. The appellant appealed and submitted medical records from January 2009 including an x-ray report from August 2009. On 15 August 2011 at the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) hearing the appellant was warned that he might be unable to establish a causal connection between his occupation and the onset of the arthritis, given the 23-year gap between them. The appellant confirmed that the problems with his knee started in the 1980s, that he had first received medical treatment in 2009 and that the condition had worsened in recent years. The F-tT dismissed the appellant’s appeal and issued a revised decision in place of the Secretary of State’s. It accepted the appellant suffered from osteoarthritis but decided that the conditions for receiving benefit were not satisfied as in its view there was no causal connection between his occupation and the onset of the osteoarthritis. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT) on two grounds, namely that (1) he had not been clearly told he would need to produce evidence of the link between his former occupation and his condition and (2) the date of onset was earlier than the original award. (He provided documentary evidence from a former colleague.) A UT judge gave the appellant permission to appeal and identified two further issues for consideration: (3) whether the F-tT had ensured that the appellant had properly understood the significance of the warning; and (4) whether bilateral patella-femoral osteoarthritis (as identified in the x ray report) could fall within the definition of the knee for the purposes of PD A14. 

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the F-tT erred in law because it had failed to explain adequately its decision not to accept the appellant’s evidence that his knee problems started in 1980, including what it made of that account and what significance, if any, was to be attached to it. Diagnosis of PD A14 is difficult for a variety of reasons, including the long latency period for its development, but this failure by the F-tT undermined its conclusion and demonstrates the importance of taking a full occupational and social history in such cases (paragraphs 18 to 23); 
2.	the question of whether the appellant’s osteoarthritis of the knee was caused by other factors than his former work was a brand new point which the appellant was not expecting. It is unclear what opportunity he was given to consider the implications of the tribunal’s warning and an adjournment should be offered in appropriate cases. This is because it provides an appellant with a meaningful opportunity to meet the changed nature of the case. In this case the appellant subsequently obtained further evidence from a former supervisor, who might be a witness, so providing further grounds for the need to offer an adjournment (paragraphs 24 to 28); 
3.	the meaning of the statutory expression “osteoarthritis of the knee” appears unambiguous in the absence of any further definition or clarification within the regulations and/or case law. It does not define the site as being within the knee but means any osteoarthritis of the knee. If it was intended to exclude those claimants with patella-femoral osteoarthritis then those responsible for drafting the legislation could have said so. They did not. Therefore, there was a further error of law by the F-tT as it appears to have assumed it was only the early osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment of the knee which was relevant to the diagnosis of PD A14 (paragraphs 29 to 37).
The case was remitted to a different tribunal, subject to the judge’s directions.

Data protection – the meaning of “personal data” – when does disclosure contravene the Data Protection principles 

In 2008 a journalist asked the Council for details of all the disciplinary action it had taken against any of its employees during the previous three years. The Council’s reply confirmed the numbers involved, including those who were dismissed, but omitted details of the actual disciplinary action and the reasons for the dismissals, stating that it had done so in accordance with section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Following a request for an internal review, the Council upheld its decision as being in accordance with section 38, as well as section 40(2), of the FOIA. The journalist complained to the Information Commissioner (IC). The Council provided the IC with two schedules, both of which contained details of the disciplinary action which had been taken, but the second, or summary, schedule omitted the date of the disciplinary action and details of the employees (their gender, job title and department). The Council initially intended to send the summary schedule to the journalist but, following legal advice, it decided not to do so. The IC issued a decision notice and among other things he decided that the original schedule would contravene the First Data Protection principle and therefore was exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, but he ordered the Council to send the summary schedule to the applicant, as he believed any personal data it contained were fully anonymous. The Council appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) which upheld its appeal, deciding, as well as other matters, that the summary schedule constituted personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and so was exempt from disclosure. The IC was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Among the issues before the Upper Tribunal was whether the second schedule contained “personal data” and, if so, whether its disclosure would contravene any of the Data Protection principles. 
 Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the interpretation given by Cranston J in R (on the application of the Department of Health) v Information Commissioner [2011] EWHC 1430 to the decision of the House of Lords in Common Services Agency v Scottish IC [2008] UKHL 47; [2008] 1 WLR 1550 was definitive and the proper approach to the question of whether anonymised information was personal data within section 1(1)(b) of the Data Protection Act 1998, for the purposes of a disclosure request, was to consider whether an individual or individuals could be identified from it, and other information which was in the possession of, or likely to come into the possession of, the recipient after it had been disclosed (paragraphs 49 to 53);
2.	the precise definition of personal data in section 1(1)(b) of the DPA 1998 concerns data in relation to a living individual who could be identified from it and any other information which is in the possession of, or likely to come into the possession of, the data controller. But despite the apparent restriction of the wording in section 1(1)(b) it was possible for the definition to be satisfied on the basis that a living individual could be identified from data linked to other information which was in the possession of (or likely to come into the possession of) persons other than the data controller. It was appropriate to interpret section 1(1)(b) in harmony with the principles set out in Recital 26 of the preamble to Directive 95/46/EC, even if that has the effect of widening the ambit of that definition. The remarks of Lord Hope supported this conclusion, see [25] and [26] of Common Services Agency (paragraphs 56 to 68); 
3.	the F-tT correctly decided that the second schedule should not be released even though it failed to address the question as to whether, for the purposes of section 1(1)(b) of the Data Protection Act 1998, living individuals could be identified from the information contained within it together with other information which was in the possession of, or was likely to come into the possession of persons other than the data controller after disclosure (paragraph 92).

Criminal injuries compensation – failure to take, without delay, all reasonable steps to inform the police of the incident – relevant considerations for a decision to withhold or reduce an award 
On 20 November 2006 the claimant, a retired police inspector, was hit in the eye by an object thrown by a group of youths who ran off. He did not report the incident until one month later on 22 December 2006 and claimed criminal injuries compensation in January 2007. Under paragraph 13(a) of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2001 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority may withhold or reduce an award where it considers that a claimant has failed to take, without delay, all reasonable steps to inform the police of the incident. The Authority rejected the claimant’s claim in view of his delay in reporting the incident and the decision was maintained on review. The claimant appealed to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel on the ground that initially he did not think the incident was serious and he did not wish to waste police time, as there was nothing they would have been able to do. Moreover, when the extent of his injury became apparent, he did try to report the matter more than once but found the local police station to be closed on each occasion. He did not attend the hearing, being disabled and by then living in France, and the appeal panel did not ask the police officer, who did attend the hearing, any questions as to the opening hours of the police station or the likely response to the claimant having reported the incident immediately. The appeal panel dismissed the appeal on the ground that the claimant’s explanation for the late reporting of the incident to the police was unacceptable and the delay had seriously hampered any opportunity to investigate the incident. The claimant applied to the Upper Tribunal for judicial review of that decision and the case was transferred to the High Court and back to the Upper Tribunal for its consideration.
Held, granting the application for judicial review and quashing the decision of the appeal panel, that:
1.	paragraph 13(a) of the Scheme, coupled with paragraph 13(b), implies that a person who seeks compensation from the State in respect of a criminal injury ought to assist the State to prosecute the offender and it also enables an award to be withheld where a claimant’s failure to report the incident immediately has meant that there has not been a proper opportunity to investigate it (paragraph 24);
2.	the reason for a claimant failing to report an incident promptly and the consequence of the failure are relevant to whether an award should be withheld or reduced and, in considering whether the claimant took “all reasonable steps”, regard must be had to the position as it would have appeared to him at the time (paragraphs 26 and 27);
3.	the appeal panel erred in law either because it regarded the claimant’s motivation and the accuracy of his understanding as to the likely effect of immediately reporting the incident as irrelevant or because it failed to record sufficient findings in the light of the way in which the claimant had put his case (paragraph 29);
4.	the appeal panel also erred in law in not giving any indication as to why its findings led to the conclusion that no award should be made and, in particular, failing to have regard to the size of the award that was to be withheld (paragraph 30);
5.	any penalty, in terms of the loss or reduction of an award, must be proportionate to what the Scheme regards as misconduct, having regard to the purpose of paragraph 13, and it is for this reason that the size of an award is relevant in some cases (paragraphs 31 to 38).
The judge remitted the case for reconsideration by the First-tier Tribunal (as successor of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel).

Practice and procedure – extension of time for appeals – correct application of Tribunal Procedure Rules

The appellant applied to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) for compensation arising from an assault on 11 August 2004. She received compensation for various physical injuries but applied for a review saying she was also suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. The CICA refused to review the case in the absence of any medical evidence from either a psychiatrist or psychologist and confirmed its decision in its letter to the appellant of 24 August 2010. Under the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 the appellant had 90 days in which to lodge an appeal with the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT). She did not do so until October 2011 and gave three reasons for her delay on the Notice of Appeal form, namely: (a) she initially felt that to appeal would make her illness worse; (b) she needed time to allow her mental state to improve; and (c) she did not know the right route through which to pursue her appeal. The issue before the F-tT was whether or not it would be both fair and just to extend the time limit under the Rules. The F-tT judge decided, without an oral hearing, that it would be inappropriate to do so in the absence of any medical evidence to explain the delay. The appellant applied for a judicial review of that decision to the Upper Tribunal.
Held, allowing the appeal and quashing the decision, that:
1.	a F-tT has unfettered power to extend the 90 days time limit for submitting an appeal: R (CD) v First-tier Tribunal (CIC) [2010] UKUT 181 (AAC); [2011] AACR 1. In proceeding the F-tT must act judicially and in accordance with the overriding objective in rule 2 by taking account of any factor rationally related to the proper judicial exercise of the power to extend time. These include those factors classified by McCowan LJ in Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v Steed [1991] 1 WLR 449, namely: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the chances of the appeal succeeding; and (4) the degree of prejudice to the respondent if the application is granted. But there may also be other factors, including the impact on other users of the tribunal system. The merits are also relevant even if, as in criminal injuries compensation cases, the appeal lies as of right and without permission: R (Birmingham City Council) v Crown Court at Birmingham [2009] EWHC 3329 (Admin); [2010] 1 WLR 1287 (paragraph 11);
2.	the F-tT’s approach to the appeal was flawed as it dealt only with the factors relevant to the cause of the delay; it failed to consider or analyse the significance of the delay, the merits of the case or the consequences, for either the CICA or the tribunal system as a whole, if the appeal were admitted (paragraph 12); 
3.	the question on the Notice of Appeal form was too restricted limiting the appellant to the reasons for delay and failing to invite her to make any comments on any other relevant factor. The problem was compounded by the judge’s decision not to hold an oral hearing, thereby depriving the appellant of a chance to refer to other matters. The judge should have taken that into account when deciding whether or not to hold an oral hearing and, if he decided not to do so he was under a particular duty, given the terms of the question on the form, to take account of any factor that might be relevant (paragraphs 13 to 14). 
The judge remitted the case to the F-tT for reconsideration in accordance with his directions.

Calculation of income – assessment of self-employed income – whether decision-makers must accept the information submitted for income tax purposes or are entitled to make their own findings of fact 

The appellant was the father of two children aged 16 and 13 who lived with their mother (the second respondent). In 2002 the mother successfully applied for child support and the Child Support Agency (CSA) assessed the appellant’s liability. In 2008 the CSA made a revised assessment of the child support based upon the appellant’s declared net weekly income. The mother appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) on the ground, among others, that the appellant had wrongly stated his weekly income. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (CMEC) (which had replaced the CSA) made a departure direction increasing the amount payable, on the basis that the appellant’s lifestyle was inconsistent with his declared income. Both parents appealed against the direction on different grounds: the mother that the revised child support was too low and the father that the direction should not have been made. All three appeals came before the F-tT. The F-tT held that the appellant had failed to declare his full income and found that his accounts for years ending 2007 and 2008, which had underpinned the figure for profits from self-employment on his 2007/2008 tax return, significantly understated his true profits. It directed CMEC to make the assessment on its calculation of the true profits, without making any deduction for income tax and national insurance from the additional amount over that declared to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It was therefore unnecessary to consider the appeals against the departure direction. On the appellant’s further appeal, the Upper Tribunal judge found that the decision of the F-tT involved no material error of law which would justify setting it aside and that the F-tT had been entitled to go behind the figures supplied to HMRC by the appellant and to make its own findings of fact. The appellant was given permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The issue before the court was how to establish the appellant’s earnings, in particular whether decision-makers are bound to accept the information provided to HMRC or whether they are entitled to make their own findings of fact.
Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	the words in paragraph 2A to 3 of Schedule 1 to the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 have an ordinary and natural meaning and the contrary position, that the decision-maker is bound to accept the information placed before, or even the information supplied by, the HMRC, is far from conclusive. The decision-maker is entitled to rely on an evaluation of the father’s actual profits from self-employment in the relevant period rather than the figures submitted to HMRC in his tax return: reasoning on KB v CMEC (CSM) UKUT 434 (AAC) and DB v CMEC (CSM) [2010] UKUT 202 (AAC) approved (paragraph 28); 
2.	if a decision-maker increases the profit above the level accepted by the HMRC then their responsibility is to deduct the income tax and national insurance contributions which would be payable on that level of profit (paragraphs 29 to 30). 
The Court remitted the case to the Secretary of State to arrange for the necessary recalculation of the child support maintenance assessment.

The claimant alleged that before October 1979 he was the victim of repeated sexual abuse by ES, an unrelated older child, after they were both placed with the same foster mother in England. The claimant later moved to Scotland and claimed criminal injuries compensation. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) rejected his claim on the basis of the “same roof rule”; it took the view that he and ES had been living as members of the same family. The claimant disagreed with this view and in his appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) he stated that ES was not registered at the foster mother’s address, as he was a serving member of the British Army (the incidents occurred either when ES was on leave or at weekends). A F-tT in Scotland issued a strike out warning and thereafter a F-tT Judge in England issued a decision striking out the appeal on the basis that ES’s army service failed to establish any new issue not previously considered and any appeal was unlikely to succeed. The CICA argued before the Upper Tribunal that section 15(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 was limited to cases arising under the law of England and Wales (or Northern Ireland) and referred to the law governing the original decision (in this case the claim for compensation). The issue before the Upper Tribunal therefore was whether proceedings for judicial review of the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal could be brought in England and Wales (and in particular before the Upper Tribunal pursuant to section 18 of the 2007 Act), or in Scotland, or in both jurisdictions. 
Held, allowing the application and quashing the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, that:
1.	as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language such applications were within the meaning of the phrase: “cases arising under the law of England and Wales”, and there was no circularity in so construing it. It followed that the 2007 Act did not provide for mutually exclusive review jurisdictions in England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other and that the forum non conveniens doctrine applied in determining whether the High Court (and the UT) or the Court of Session should determine a review of a decision when both have jurisdiction to do so (paragraph 30);
2.	it was common ground that the Court of Session had supervisory jurisdiction but as the forum non conveniens doctrine applied the convenient forum was the Upper Tribunal (paragraph 4);
3.	the F-tT erred in law by failing to consider, or to properly consider, whether: (a) the alleged abuse, or some of it, was inflicted after the alleged abuser had joined the army, and, if so, whether the alleged abuser was then living elsewhere as his main residence or when he was on service, and, if so, whether in either or both of those circumstances he and the claimant were, at the relevant times, living together in their foster home or former foster home, and/or (b) the alleged abuse, or some of it, was inflicted after the alleged abuser had attained the age of 18, and so had ceased to be a child and, if so, whether the claimant, as a foster child, and the alleged abuser, as an adult who had been a foster child of the same foster mother, were, at the relevant times, members of the same family (paragraph 31).
The Upper Tribunal remitted the case to the First-tier Tribunal for reconsideration.

The claimant submitted a claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) following an unprovoked attack in Scotland. On 11 February 2008 it was rejected by CICA on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim. On 29 April 2008 the claimant applied for a reconsideration of that refusal but on 12 May 2008 CICA confirmed its decision. The claimant then had 90 days in which to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) but did not do so until 20 August 2010. On 13 October 2010 a F-tT judge sitting in England decided not to extend the time limit. On 11 February 2011 the claimant applied for judicial review to the Upper Tribunal. Eventually, after an initial refusal, it granted permission to apply for judicial review on the basis that the Upper Tribunal had jurisdiction and having received from the claimant medical evidence of her health problems. CICA argued before the Upper Tribunal that section 15(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 was limited to cases arising under the law of England and Wales (or Northern Ireland) and referred to the law governing the original decision (in this case the claim for compensation). The issue before the Upper Tribunal therefore was whether proceedings for judicial review of the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal could be brought in England and Wales (and in particular before the Upper Tribunal pursuant to section 18 of the 2007 Act), or in Scotland, or in both jurisdictions.

2.	it was common ground that the Court of Session had supervisory jurisdiction to set aside the decision of the F-tT not to extend the time limit for bringing the appeal and so admit it for hearing. It followed that the forum non conveniens doctrine applied and the convenient forum was the Court of Session (paragraphs 31 to 32).
The Upper Tribunal decided to adjourn the hearing to allow the claimant time to start proceedings in the Court of Session, failing which the case was to be reconvened before one of the Upper Tribunal judges.

Work capability assessment – whether a person qualifying for the support group under Schedule 3 to the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 must inevitably be more severely impaired than one who qualifies under Schedule 2
The claimant, who suffered from depression and diabetes, was receiving employment support allowance (ESA). The benefit was withdrawn following a decision by the Secretary of State that she did not have limited capability for work. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT). It decided that descriptor 16(a) in Schedule 2 was appropriate - the F-tT accepted the claimant needed constant encouragement to start and complete routine daily jobs and so had limited capability for work. Although it had not been asked to consider any of the activities listed under Schedule 3 the F-tT nevertheless stated that in its view none of them applied. On 16 May 2011 the claimant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the ground that descriptor 10 of Schedule 3 must also apply as it exactly corresponded to descriptor 16(a) of Schedule 2. Permission to appeal was refused by the district tribunal judge on the basis that the Schedule 3 assessment was more stringent and a person could only enter the support group if they had a severe level of functional limitation. He cited, in support of this view, a Ministerial statement, in a parliamentary committee considering the legislation, which referred to the government’s intention that the support group would only be for a minority of severely impaired customers. The claimant renewed her application and a judge of the Upper Tribunal (UT) granted her permission to appeal. The issue before the UT was whether or not a person qualifying under Schedule 3 must inevitably be more severely impaired than one who qualified under Schedule 2.

Held, allowing the appeal, that:
1.	irrespective of what the Minister told the relevant committee the wording of the legislation and regulations provided no support for the argument that a person qualifying under Schedule 3 must inevitably be more severely impaired than one who qualified under Schedule 2 (paragraphs 21);
2.	the only difference between the wording of descriptor 16(a) in Schedule 2 and descriptor 10(a) in Schedule 3 is that 16(a) contained a cause of the inability to carry out the specified tasks (cognitive impairment or a severe disorder of mood or behaviour). Arguably this actually makes 16(a) narrower than 10(a). In any event once the F-tT found that 16(a) applied then it was a necessary consequence that 10(a) applied also (paragraphs 22).
The judge substituted his own decision for that of the F-tT and referred the case back to the Secretary of State to consider any questions relating to payment of benefit in the light of his decision.

Work capability assessment – standing and sitting – meaning of “either … or” – whether the ability to stand, sit, or a combination of standing and sitting so as to remain at a work station for the requisite period negates award of points
The appellant had suffered an ankle injury for which she was awarded nine points for the mobilising unaided descriptor 1(b). No further points were awarded. The appellant’s appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal (F tT) as it decided that she did not satisfy any of the descriptors in Activity 2 because she was able to remain sitting at a work station for more than an hour and was also able to move away thereafter, so avoiding significant discomfort or exhaustion. The appellant appealed on the grounds that the F-tT had failed to have sufficient regard to her problems with standing. The issue before the Upper Tribunal was the proper reading to be given to descriptor 2(c) for the activity of “standing and sitting”; in particular whether the use of “either ... or” was meant in a disjunctive or a conjunctive sense.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	dictionaries and other guides make it clear that “either ... or”, while normally used disjunctively, can also be used conjunctively (equivalent to “both ... and”) so the ambiguity is inherent within the language. Where the legislative wording does not admit of only one reading it is necessary to consider both the linguistic and legislative contexts in which the words are used (paragraphs 14 to 15);
2.	the decision of the F-tT did not involve any material error of law, as a person who can stand at a work station for more than an hour before needing to move away does not score six points (even if she cannot sit for that length of time). Similarly, a person who can sit at a work station for more than an hour before needing to move away also fails to score six points (even if she cannot stand for that period). Furthermore, a person who can neither stand nor sit continuously but can remain at a work station by a combination of standing and sitting for more than an hour (before needing to move away) likewise does not meet the requirements of the descriptor. However, an individual who can manage none of these scenarios meets the test under descriptor 2(c) and so scores six points (paragraph 4);
3.	the same principles apply to the interpretation of standing and sitting descriptor 2(b), where the wording is identical save that the “statutory endurance test” is a maximum of 30 minutes rather than an hour (paragraph 5);
4.	the same reasoning may not necessarily apply where “either ... or” is used in defining other descriptors in Schedule 2, as the proper construction will depend on the particular context (paragraph 39).

Calculation of income – self-employed earnings – drawings made from capital of a partnership 

The appellant was a non-resident father. On 9 February 2005 the Child Support Agency (CSA) confirmed by letter that he was liable to pay £25 per week in child support maintenance. The appellant neither appealed against nor challenged the decision at that time. From October 2009 the CSA made a supersession decision and reduced the appellant’s liability to £15 per week, apparently following a relevant change of circumstances. Again no appeal or challenge was made against the decision. In February 2011 the appellant’s solicitor asked the CSA to revise its decision of 9 February 2005 as it had wrongly assessed the appellant’s income. It refused to do so. In June 2011 the appellant’s solicitor appealed against the CSA’s refusal. In December 2011 a First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) hearing was held to decide whether or not to admit the appeal. It was argued by the CSA that there was no right of appeal against a refusal to revise and that any appeal against the decision of 9 February 2005 was out of time. It was argued for the appellant that there was no time limit in cases involving official error. Schedule 1 to the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 provides, as far as relevant to “2003 scheme” child support cases (in head (ii) of sub-paragraph (c)), that where a person has made an unsuccessful application for revision of a decision under regulation 3A(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, there is one month (extendable to 13 months) to appeal against the decision, running from the date of notification that the decision was not to be revised. The F-tT decided that the time limit for making an appeal could not be extended beyond 13 months from 9 February 2005, so that the appeal was not admitted for consideration. An appeal against that decision was accepted by the Upper Tribunal in view of the decision of the three-judge panel in LS v London Borough of Lambeth (HB) [2010] UKUT 461 (AAC); [2011] AACR 27. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (which had replaced the CSA) did not support the appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that case law restricted the operation of the relevant part of Schedule 1 to circumstances where the application for revision was made within a specified time, but also submitted that the appellant’s solicitor should have been regarded as having made an application for revision under regulation 3A(1), which would have meant that the appeal was in time. The appellant’s solicitor again argued that there was no time limit to appeal a refusal to revise on the basis of official error.

Held, dismissing the appeal, but requesting the Secretary of State to reconsider whether the decision of 9 February 2005 should be revised, that:
1.	the decisions of the Tribunal of Social Security Commissioners in R(IS) 15/04 and of the Court of Appeal in Beltekian v Westminster City Council and another [2004] EWCA Civ 1784, reported as R(H) 8/05, held, in relation to regulations relating to other benefits but in similar terms to those of the relevant part of Schedule 1, that a new time for appealing only started to run when the regulation made express provision for an application for revision to be made, which was not the case for the ground of revision of official error. Those decisions were binding on the Upper Tribunal unless shown to be wrong. But the logic of the reasoning behind its conclusion appeared correct and so had to apply equally to the relevant part of Schedule 1. Even if the outcome was contrary to the CSA’s normal practice, that could not stand in the way of the outcome required by authority and convincing reasoning. Nor could the existence of a refusal of permission to appeal by an Upper Tribunal judge adopting the opposite outcome (paragraphs 25 and 27);
2.	 even if there had been a plain official error, as submitted for the appellant, a refusal to revise a decision could not trigger the running of a new period for appeal. There had to be one rule for all applications for revision on the ground of official error and subsequent refusals regardless of the strength or otherwise of the case for there having been an official error. Rule 2(3)(b) of the First-tier Tribunal Rules obliged the F-tT to deal with cases justly and fairly when interpreting any rule or practice direction. However, that duty is fundamentally addressed to matters of procedure, or the conduct of proceedings, or to the application of rules to particular circumstances in the course of proceedings. It could not have any influence over the interpretation of a provision directed to the question of whether proceedings could be commenced at all: that was a question of jurisdiction. The adoption of the general principle that cases should be dealt with fairly and justly had to stand against the actual terms of provisions defining the time for bringing appeals. It could not warrant any process of reading into such provisions exceptions or qualifications that were not in the legislation. Nor could the consequences, that a refusal to revise such a decision more than 13 months ago on the ground of official error could only be challenged by way of judicial review in the High Court or by way of making new applications for revision (paragraph 26);
3.	an additional powerful reason in favour of the above conclusion was that sub-paragraph (c)(i) of the provision in Schedule 1 to the First-tier Tribunal Procedure Rules applied for the purposes of the original child support scheme but not for the revised scheme introduced for new cases from 2003. So for old scheme cases the statutory position was the same as for ordinary social security cases and the refusal of revision on the ground of official error could not trigger the running of a new period for appealing. It would be extraordinary, and could not possibly have been intended, if that was the position for old scheme cases but the reverse for 2003 scheme cases (under sub-paragraph (c)(ii)) (paragraph 28);
4.	an officer of the Secretary of State was asked to reconsider revision of the decision of 9 September 2005 because, among other reasons, it appeared there had been an official error in assessing the appellant’s income, as it had been clearly established in previous decisions of the Child Support Commissioner and of the Upper Tribunal that the amount taken by a partner, or any self-employed earner, as “salary” or drawings from the business was irrelevant to the calculation of income from self-employment under paragraph 8 of the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 as at February 2005 (CCS/3156/2000, CCS/1246/2002 and AR v Bradford Metropolitan District Council [2008] UKUT 30 (AAC) (also reported as R(H) 6/09)) (paragraphs 30 to 35).

Children’s Barred List – standard of proof – decision not to apply Stage 3 of Structured Judgement Process – whether error of law
The appellant became step father to three children after he married their mother in 2004. On 7 October 2009 he was convicted of two offences against a child, contrary to section 1(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and one of causing actual bodily harm to his wife. As a result he was automatically included on both the Children’s and Adult’s Barred Lists under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. Following representations on his behalf the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) decided to remove the appellant’s name from the Adult’s Barred List but not the Children’s Barred List. The ISA’s decision was made without following its own procedures: the normal risk assessment at Stage 3 of the Structured Judgement Process (SJP) was omitted, as in the ISA’s view there was insufficient information to complete the process, and the case was not referred to either a senior manager or the ISA Board. The appellant appealed against the decision on the grounds that his actions were not serious but simply those of a normal parent dealing with unusually difficult behaviour. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on the grounds, among others, that the ISA had failed to follow its own procedures and may also have failed to take proper account of all the available evidence (that the original serious charges were dropped and the particular domestic context in which the offences occurred). Following the appeal the ISA carried out a review and decided to confirm its decision and the case then proceeded to a hearing before the Upper Tribunal.
 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the questions of the weight to be given to the evidence was a matter for the ISA and it was bound to consider, under paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 to the 2006 Act, the relevance of the police’s evidence about the original charges. The evaluation at Stage 4 of the SJP was almost entirely concerned with the offences with which the appellant was ultimately charged and there was nothing to suggest that the ISA failed to appreciate that the original charges were not proceeded with (paragraph 15); 
2.	a public authority may act unlawfully if it acts contrary to the legitimate expectation of a person affected by either departing from an established policy or practice, or by doing so without giving the person affected an opportunity to make representations before the change is put into effect: Nadarajah, Abdi v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 1363 and R (Bhatt Murphy & ors), R (Niazi) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 755. But it was clear from Bhatt Murphy that there must be unfairness sufficient to amount to an abuse of process for the concept of legitimate expectation to come into play. The SJP forms part of an administrative (not a judicial) decision making process and the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not confer the status of a legal procedural code on a document developed to assist administrative decision makers in making decisions. The ISA will not have erred in law if it decides to omit a stage in its procedures which, in a particular case, adds no value to the decision making process (paragraphs 19 to 21);
3.	the Court of Appeal has held that the Upper Tribunal cannot carry out its own fresh consideration of the evidence but must give proper weight to the assessment of the ISA: Independent Safeguarding Authority v SB and Royal College of Nursing [2012] EWCA Civ 977; [2013] AACR 24. While the Upper Tribunal can consider whether a decision is disproportionate, the Court of Appeal has held that in doing so, it must give proper weight to the authority’s decision. There was no basis for holding the ISA’s decision to be disproportionate. It was fully entitled to give the weight that it did to each of the different factors; in particular, the seriousness of the offences of which the appellant was convicted and his refusal to acknowledge the full extent of his responsibility for them. The evidence before the ISA fully justified the barring decision without the need for the SJP to be applied and accordingly there was no injustice to the appellant in the decision not to carry out Stage 3 of the SJP and therefore no error of law arose for that reason (paragraphs 26 to 31).

Housing costs – ineligible service charges – general and administrative charges – proper method of calculation – inconsistency of approach between R(IS) 2/07 and R(PC) 1/07
The claimant owned on a long leasehold a flat situated within a retirement complex designed for independent, but supported, living of residents. All residents paid a monthly service charge. The claimant was eligible for help under state pension credit (SPC) towards her accommodation costs but not her supported living costs. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), after considering the information provided by the management agents, assessed the claimant’s eligible costs as just over £60.00 a month (the actual service charge was over £400). The claimant appealed to a First-tier Tribunal (F-tT) referring to a previous decision, CIS/2901/2004, later reported as R(IS) 2/07), and the DWP’s own guidance on implementing that decision. At the hearing the claimant was represented but the Secretary of State was not. After considering all the available evidence, the F-tT allowed the claimant’s appeal. The DWP appealed against that decision. It argued that the F-tT had misinterpreted the case law concerning the assessment of eligible service charges and had failed to undertake a sufficient analysis of the evidence. It was argued by the claimant’s representative that the Secretary of State was simply seeking to re-argue factual issues already decided by the F-tT and had misunderstood the evidence before the F-tT as well as the relevant case law. 
 
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	an appeal at this level was not an opportunity to re-run the case on the facts or to raise points which had not been previously raised. It was axiomatic that the weight to be attached to any particular piece of evidence was quintessentially a matter for the fact-finding tribunal. As Rix LJ explained in Fryer-Kelsey v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] EWCA Civ 511 (reported as R(IB) 6/05), it was not the function of appellate courts, including the Upper Tribunal, “to set the appeal tribunal to rights by teaching them how to do their job of weighing the evidence” (paragraphs 29 to 30);
2.	there was nothing to suggest that the F-tT had failed to apply properly the principles in R(PC) 1/07 regarding the use of data from other retirement developments to establish costs: it considered both personal and documentary evidence at the hearing and had not unquestioningly relied on evidence about other similar developments (paragraph 33);
3.	the F-tT failed to adopt the approach advocated in cases CPC/968/2005 and R(PC) 1/07 to the allocation of administrative costs for “accommodation” and “support” purposes (to apportion them by the same ratio as eligible versus ineligible costs and not staff costs). Instead it inadvertently accepted the approach taken in R(IS) 2/07. But the assessment was inevitably complex and the eventual figure necessarily approximate. The legal system should strive for, but will not always attain, perfection and any error of law must be material to the outcome. Any difference in outcome for the claimant was marginal and she was content with the F tT’s decision. So, given the particular circumstances of this appeal, it was neither right nor proportionate to declare the F-tT’s decision erroneous in law only then to decline to set it aside or to re-make it in similar terms (paragraphs 46 to 49).

Residence and presence conditions – right to reside – claimant entering and staying in the United Kingdom for purpose of taking up offer of employment actually made
The claimant, a German national, had a history of residence and work in the United Kingdom between 1985 and 2002. Her daughter was born in 2000. The father was British and the daughter acquired British nationality. The claimant’s relationship with the child’s father broke down and she returned to Germany in 2002. She came back to the United Kingdom in 2006 after receiving a modest legacy. She also held an offer of employment as a research assistant which involved working from home. Her efforts to find suitable accommodation were unsuccessful – she needed a reliable internet connection. In October she claimed and was awarded jobseeker’s allowance. In December she required urgent medical treatment and claimed income support which was refused on the basis that she did not have a right to reside. At all material times the job offer remained open to the claimant. The First-tier Tribunal had allowed the appeal on a concession made by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The DWP then resiled from that concession and appealed against the tribunal decision. The issue before the Upper Tribunal was whether the claimant could show that she had a right to reside when she claimed income support. There were three possible grounds: (1) whether the claimant fell within the concept of “worker” in Article 39 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); (2) whether the claimant could establish a right to reside on the basis of the principles established in Case C 34/09 Ruiz Zambrano v ONEm [2011] ECR I-1177; and (3) whether the claimant could establish a derivative right of residence under Article 12 of Regulation 1612/68/EEC.
Held, dismissing the appeal, that:
1.	the claimant had a right to reside in the United Kingdom for the purpose of accepting an offer of employment actually made: Article 39(3)(a) and (b). At the material time the claimant was still within the scope of Article 39(3)(a) and (b) (now Article 45(3)(a) and (b) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). She had not lost that status when she claimed jobseeker’s allowance: there was no mutual exclusivity in being both the holder of a job offer, and claiming a right to reside under Article 39, and being a job seeker, and claiming jobseeker’s allowance. The determination of the duration of the period between arriving and accepting an offer of employment requires an assessment of all the circumstances of each particular case (paragraphs 38 to 61); 
2.	the claimant could not rely on the principle established in the Zambrano case, which was limited to situations involving third country nationals where the effect of the decision in issue would be to force the Union citizen members of the family to leave the territory of the Union as a whole. The principle in the Zambrano case was a narrow one: Harrison (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1736 applied [62 to 69];
3.	reliance on Article 12 of Regulation 1612/68/EEC (now Article 10 of Regulation 492/2011) was not precluded where the child was a national of the host Member State (disagreeing with the conclusion to the contrary in Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v SW (IS) [2011] UKUT 508 (AAC)) and in the circumstances of this case the claimant could not rely on employment in the earlier period of residence as the basis for claiming a right to reside under Article 12. Whether an absence from the host Member State results in the loss of the ability to claim integration rights will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case. The Upper Tribunal suggested a test for determining when a gap in residence will, and will not, preclude reliance on a period of employment in an earlier period of residence. It observed that the test will always involve considering what has happened in the past, rather than what might happen in the future, and that the longer the absence the more difficult it will be to rely on the earlier period in work (paragraphs 77 to 82).
The Upper Tribunal set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as erroneous in law and directed the Secretary of State to investigate whether the other conditions of entitlement for benefit were satisfied.
